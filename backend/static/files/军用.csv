"Unmanned Surveillance Problem: Mathematical Formulation, Solution Algorithms, and Experiments","Modern technologies used in military operations, as well as in many civil applications, have become common in recent years. Unmanned aerial vehicles play a key role in tasks such as monitoring and inspection, reconnaissance, surveillance, mapping, and networking. This article deals with the unmanned surveillance problem, which is a problem of the path planning for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles performing persistent surveillance of a ground area of interest. The surveillance is performed via sensor systems of individual drones from a set of waypoints deployed in the area of operations. The objective of the problem is to plan a route (that is, the order in which the waypoints are visited) of every vehicle in the fleet to ensure the best observation of the area of interest. This article presents a new mathematical formulation of the problem. The novelty in this formulation consists of a new perspective on the objective function, which is based on an integral of time function to minimize time between observations of portions of the area conducted from waypoints. For the solution, three deterministic approaches are proposed. To evaluate the results, a set of benchmark instances for the problem is defined. The solution algorithms are analyzed and evaluated by experiments conducted on the benchmark instances. The best approach is shown to be the algorithm that uses a multidepot vehicle routing problem solution as a template to generate a solution for the unmanned surveillance problem.",Drone,2020
"Drones, imagem-tempo e o fim do poder soberano","Abstract: This paper deals with the specificity that characterizes one of the most important technological aerial products dedicated to surveillance and attack being in use nowadays, the drones, showing in which sense this new technology is a decisive turning point in the evolution of the domination of the skies and therefore, as suggested by Carl Schmitt, in the transformation of the political-theological field in contemporary societies. The radical immanence of the political field proposed by liberalism, such as Schmitt described it, finds in drones one of its most typical instruments. To characterize the specificity of drones regarding other visual and aerial war machines, it will be proposed an approximation with the Deleuzian concept of image-time, in order to determine its singularity through the intrinsic properties of the images so produced. The main characteristic of the Deleuzian time-image to be integrated in the analysis of drones will be its haptic aspect. At this point, the relation between Deleuze¡¯s cinema books and his work in collaboration with F¨¦lix Guattari will be essential to characterize the political dimension of the drone-image.",Drone,2020
3D Optimal Surveillance Trajectory Planning for Multiple UAVs by Using Particle Swarm Optimization With Surveillance Area Priority,"The use of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been regarded as a promising technique in both military and civilian applications. However, due to the lack of relevant laws and regulations, the misuse of illegal drones poses a serious threat to social security. In this paper, we develop a trajectory planner based on particle swarm optimization and a proposed surveillance area importance updating mechanism aimed at deriving three-dimensional (3D) optimal surveillance trajectories for multiple monitoring drones. We also propose a multi-objective fitness function in accordance with energy consumption, flight risk, and surveillance area priority in order to evaluate the trajectories generated by the proposed trajectory planner. Simulation results show that the trajectories generated by the proposed trajectory planner can preferentially visit important areas while obtaining a high fitness value in various practical situations.",Drone,2020
Do Emerging Military Technologies Matter for International Politics?,"We live in a digital world. This fact has significant consequences for warfare. Two technologies in particular, cyber and drones, feature in military and intelligence operations and in scholarship. In addition, a new vein of scholarship is examining how advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to shape the future of warfare. While scholars disagree about the consequences of these technologies for international politics, they tend to agree that their consequences are mediated by the ability of military organizations, whether state or nonstate actors, to use them effectively in relevant military scenarios and in the pursuit of political ends. Studying newer military technologies, with less empirical evidence than is available for technologies that have been around for decades, also generates methodological challenges for research.",Drone,2020
A Study on the Required Operational Abilities of the Drone Combat System for Countering Underground Facilities (UGFs),"This research aimed to derive the required operational capability considerations of the drone combat system to carry out CWMD operations in underground facilities. The Delphi technique was used for this study and the survey was conducted among 30 experts in the fields of drone combat systems and CWMD operations, and in the military and civilian sectors.

As a result of the factor analysis, a total of eight factors were derived.",Drone,2020
Operational Concept and Effectiveness for Aerial Tactical Network in TICN,"Due to the rapid development of drone-related technologies, technical research is underway to establish a multi-layer airborne network that utilizes drones. The military is actively discussing how to use drones.Especially, the Army is demanding for the development of a ground-based tactical information communication system into a multi-layer integrated network structure in order to prepare for future changes in the battlefield environment. However, research on operation of combat radio network using airborne drones, operation of backbone network using stratosphere airships, or analysis of the effectiveness of those systems are insufficient to overcome communication constraints on the ground and ensure real-time command-control and situational awareness. This paper analyzes the operational environment of the combat wireless network and ground backbone network, which are sub-systems of the tactical information communication network(TICN) on the ground, and introduces how to operate the airborne backbone network using small drones and stratosphere airships to solve their problems. In addition, the results of the analysis using Riverbed Modeler are presented for increasing packet transmission success rate and decreasing transmission delay when not operating an aviation tactical network and when operating an aviation tactical network, respectively.",Drone,2020
Anlaysis of Single and Multiple Spoofing Techniques for GPS Receiver Deception in Low Target Detection Accuracy,"Considering that Unmanned Aerial Vehicle technology is used for as surveillance & terrorism, technical research to attack it is also in progress. Satellite navigation technology is used for common autonomous navigation due to its low cost and high accuracy. This paper analyzes the effect of navigation result during jamming attack to drone target using satellite navigation. It generates various spoofing signals in various scenarios under low detection accuracy environments. The navigation results due to the detection error are examined in the software defined receiver. We test whether the deception performance is different in the condition of one deception signal. We analyze the test results and limitations when applying a simple multi-spoofing technique to overcome the low detection accuracy.",Drone,2020
Patent Trend Analysis of Anti-Drone : Focusing on the Neutralization Means and Methods,"Recently, drones have been used for a variety of purposes, as well as military use, widely distributed among the public. However, as drones are used for illegal purposes such as crime and terrorism, research on anti-dron-related technologies has been active recently. Anti-drone technology can be classified into detection, tracking, and neutralization. Among them, the neutralization technologies are distinguished by using networks to capture drones, by disturbing control frequencies or GPS signals that drones are using, and by firing guns and lasers directly into drones to destroy them. Thus, in this paper, we searched for patents applied to Korea, USA, Japan, and EUrope since 2000 for drone neutralization technology, and extracted a total of 151 valid patents. According to the analysis, the most frequently applied to the USA, the main methods of neutralizing drone are the use of capture networks and radio disturbance. The capture network mainly used defense drones and projectiles equipped with nets on the ground. And radio disturbance methods were mainly used for radio disturbance devices and portable devices(jamming guns) on the ground were used. Major applicants included Battelle Memorial Institute, XiDrone Systems, Diehl Defense, Department 13, MBDA and Openworks Engineering.",Drone,2020
A Study on the Effective Utilization of Public Service Drones - Focused on Search and Rescue Drones -,"Drones, which were originally developed for military purpose, have expanded rapidly not only in hobbies, leisure, but also in broadcasting, filming, and public sectors, and search and rescue drones have been used to find four Korean teachers who went to Nepal for volunteer work but went missing in the avalanche. The government is encouraging the use of drones in the public sector as a policy to foster the drone industry, and the market is expected to expand in the future.This study presents improvement measures and specific directions for use of drones by public agencies at a time when the use of drones is expanding in the public sector. To that end, this research reviewed the interviews of relevant experts, analysis of drone operation regulations by public agencies, and the cases of operation of drones for searching missing persons by police.First of all, it will have to secure skilled personnel before the introduction of the drones and then determine the specifications of the drones through sufficient review, and then be put into the mission after careful examination of the drones. Next, it is necessary to draw up a base rule for drone operation and draw up a manual accordingly. Finally, drone flight has the risk of a crash, and it is essential to secure dedicated personnel for drone operation, especially since drones in the public sector are specialized in large scale compared to hobby drones to achieve their purpose.This research only conducted a detailed analysis of the National Police Agency's drones for searching for missing persons, and there are limitations to the number of people interviewed. Subsequent studies will require analysis of various public institutions, and in addition to interviews, surveys will require analysis of various data and statistics.",Drone,2020
A Study on the Enhancement of Authentication in LTE-Based Dronebot Combat System Using PUF-OTP,"Dronebot combat system is considered to be in charge of its role as a key game changer on the future battlefield. However, due to the nature of drones using the wireless communication, they can be exposed to various cyber threats. And when commercial mobile communication technology developed with emphasis on transmission speed or quality of service, such as 4G LTE or 5G network, is utilized as the underlying network of dronebot combat system, measures must be taken to ensure security. This paper assumes that the dronebot combat system, which the ROK Army is currently operating on the basis of the 4G LTE network, and proposes ways to enhance security through improved authentication. Proposed approach enhances the EPS-AKA authentication procedure applied to 4G LTE network by utilizing PUF-OTP, various security vulnerabilities of existing EPS-AKA are eliminated and security is enhanced. In addition, the authentication procedure was organized by excluding the use of the CRP table in consideration of possible delay in authentication by the CRP table when operating a large number of dronebots. We also suggest ways to allow ground control stations and dronebot to perform the authentication process using the PUF-OTP in case the 4G LTE network fails",Drone,2020
International Law on Drone's Military Use  - Focuse on Proportionality and Discrimination Principles -,"Despite growing international cooperation for maintenance of international peace and security, wars continue to occur due to conflicted state interests. Continuing conflicts has advanced development of various weapon systems such as global integrated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. However, with a big increase in the number of civilian casualties caused by the weapon systems development, the international community has also advanced diplomatic efforts to minimize deaths of civilian and military personnel.Therefore, it is essential to observe the principle of discrimination between combatants and non-combatants when operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones. Drones have become more capable of distinguishing combatants from non-combatants due to its high-tech prowess. In the operation of drones, any parties involved in combat or the war are responsible for mounting civilian casualties. In addition, it should comply with the principle of proportionality that calls for a balance between results of such action and expected military advantage anticipated from the attack. The rule of proportionality prohibits use of military force which may be expected to cause excessive civilian harm. Drones have been able to track and monitor targets for hours and select the accurate locations of the targets. The aim is to reduce civilian losses and damage to a minimum. Drones meet the standards of Article 51.4 of the Additional Protocol.",Drone,2020
Enhanced Social Spider Optimization Algorithm for Increasing Performance of Multiple Pursuer Drones in Neutralizing Attacks From Multiple Evader Drones,"We propose an optimization algorithm for reducing execution time needed by multiple pursuers in solving a variant of the Multiple-Pursuer Multiple-Evader (MPME) problem where each evader tries to attack an area defended by pursuers. This problem is a variant of the Multi-Agent Pursuit Evasion problem. In our discussed problem, a group of pursuers tries to defend an area from a group of evaders' attacks. The main task given in this problem is how pursuers can capture or immobilize as soon as possible any evader trying to get closer to the defended area (evaders' target). We use Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm as the basis of our proposed method. In SSO, there are female spiders, dominant-male spiders, and non-dominant-male spiders collaborating to catch their prey. In SSO, there are three main procedures usually exist: calculation of fitness value, the vibrational summons of surrounding spiders, and mating procedure. In this paper, we develop an enhanced SSO algorithm where excludes the mating procedure and propose a practical calculation process for solving our discussed problem. SSO is one of the recent optimization algorithms developed in the computer science field. Developing this algorithm for solving dynamic problem like the MPME variant surely brings a novelty in the computer science research area. We test our proposed method in a 3D simulation environment where we manifest all pursuers and evaders as drones. Based on our experiment result, our algorithm performs better than commonly used methods for solving the MPME problem.",Drone,2020
Random Number Generator Using Sensors for Drone,"In recent years, drones have been widely used in many areas such as farming, movie making, surveillance and delivery. So, there is a need to protect these drones against security attacks including hijacking, spying and theft of stored data through the utilization of security mechanisms. Cryptographic keys are needed to operate these security mechanisms, and they must be generated by using random number generators which create unpredictable and non-regenerable random numbers. However, existing random number generators used in drones are not tailored for drones specifically as they use random sources generated on a desktop, not a drone. Recently, random number generators utilizing sensors in mobile phones and IoT (Internet of Things) devices have been studied, but are not appropriate for drones. In this paper, considering that drone sensors must be applied to flight and stationary modes, we proposed a drone specific random number generator called DroneRNG and implemented it. Then, we showed that our DroneRNG passed all of the NIST randomization tests and possesses better statistical properties and unpredictability than random number generators that are currently used in drones.",Drone,2020
Measurement based threat aware drone base station deployment,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining importance with many civilian and military applications. Especially the surveillance, search/rescue, and military operations may have to be carried out in extremely constrained environments. In such scenarios, drone base stations (DBSs) have to provide communication services to the people at the ground. The ground users may have no access to the global positioning system (GPS); therefore, their locations have to be estimated using alternative techniques. Besides there may be threats in the environment, such as shooters. In this work, we address the problem of optimal DBS deployment under the aforementioned constraints. We propose a novel DBS deployment algorithm that uses estimated positions of ground users and threats. The proposed algorithm is based on receiver signal strength-based maximum likelihood estimate of user locations and K-means clustering supported heuristic that takes into account the positions of threats. Numerical results show that proposed algorithm performs close to the computation intensive near-optimal algorithm and strikes a good trade-off between the number of unserved users and the probability of DBSs not being hit.",Drone,2020
Drone Force Deployment Optimization Algorithm For Efficient Military Drone Operations,"One of the major advancements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the use of Internet of Drones (IoD), which combines the Internet of Things (IoT) and drone technology. IoD technology is especially important for efficiently and economically operating C4ISR operations in actual battlefields supporting various combat situations. The purpose of this study is to solve the problems of limited battery capacity of drones and lack of budgeting criteria for military drone transcription, introduction, and operation. If the mission area is defined and corresponding multi-drone hovering check points and mission completion time limits are set, then an energy and time co-optimized scheduling and operation control scheme is needed. Because such a scheme does not exist, in this paper, a Drone Force Deployment Optimization (DFDO) scheme is proposed to help schedule multi-drone operation scheduling and networked based remote multi-drone control.",Drone,2020
The Study on analysis methodology of optimal performance and quantity for Mission-Based drones,"This paper addresses the analysis method about optimal performance and required quantity for Mission-Based drones. In the case of drones, although scientific verification of operational performance and quantity of demanded, such as total flight time, total operation time, and appropriate required quantity, is required depending on the operation concept, there is no methodology for analyzing them systematically. That is the reason this research was carried out. Through the suggestion and study about Mission-Based six step analysis method and, this study can present the optimal ROC (Required Operational Capability) and the required quantity based on the operational concept of drones, and technical and economic effects were suggested.",Drone,2020
A Study on the Design of Network System for Defense Integrated Data Center Using NFV/SDN,"The creation of the Defense Integrated Data Center(DIDC) has resulted in a reduction in manpower, operating costs, efficient and effective management of resources. However, it is difficult to effectively collect and manage the data of a large number of battlefields coming from equipments such as drones, robots, and IoT added to the fourth industrial revolution and the future battlefield. Therefore, we will propose the design of DIDC network system using NFV and SDN, which are emerging as the core technologies of 5G, a mobile communication technology. After analyzing the data sheet of each equipment, it is considered that by integrating the redundant functions, energy efficiency, resource utilization and effective network management will be possible.",Drone,2020

Past UAV Program Failures and Implications for Current UAV Programs,"There has been an increasing interest in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) among the US armed services over the past 20 years. However, despite over four billion dollars in investment, the services have cancelled numerous development programs and achieved only marginal success with the fielded systems. This research will examine recent Department of Defense (DoD) UAV development efforts and identify common causes for the repeated failure of DoD UAV programs to become operationally robust. Two ongoing UAV development efforts, the RQ-4A Global Hawk UAV Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator (ACTD) program and the X-45 Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) Advanced Technology Demonstrator (ATD) program, will then be examined for evidence that we are incorporating these lessons learned into our current programs.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Unmanned Ground Vehicle Teaming: UAV Guided Navigation,"We simulated a military reconnaissance environment and examined the performance of ground robotics operators who needed to use sensor images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to navigate their ground robot to the locations of the targets. We also evaluated participants spatial ability and examined if it affected their performance or perceived workload. Results showed that participants overall performance (speed and accuracy) was better when they had access to images from larger UAVs with fixed orientations, compared to other UAV conditions (baseline- no UAV, micro-air vehicle, and UAV with orbiting views). Participants experienced the highest workload when the UAV was orbiting.",Drone,2020
UAV-Aided Data Delivery Scheme Based on Opportunistic Virtual Intersections for Smart Transportation Networks,"Smart transportation networks, featured by high mobility and intermittent connectivity, are facing critical challenges in data delivery especially when the network is sparse and with less or no support from any infrastructure, such as in disaster and military environments. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), due to their flexible mobility, can be envisioned to enhance the connectivity of ground vehicular networks. In this paper, incorporating UAVs into vehicular networks, a novel data delivery scheme, named UAV-assisted data delivery (UADD), is proposed for smart transportation networks. We introduce a novel concept called ""opportunistic virtual intersections"", at which UAVs can communicate with ground vehicles, and assist to deliver data packets. Specifically, at an opportunistic virtual intersection, UAVs may act as a relay, which can relay data packets between two vehicles as an intermediate hop, or deliver data packets in a store-carry-and-forward manner. The data forwarding rules are devised based on expected delivery delay and delivery probability of data packets. The performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed UAV-assisted data delivery scheme can achieve a significant improvement of data delivery performance in terms of delivery delay and delivery ratio.",Drone,2019
Impact of an Interfering Node on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Communications,"Unlike terrestrial communications, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications have some advantages such as the line-of-sight (LoS) environment and flexible mobility. However, the interference will be still inevitable. In this paper, we analyze the effect of an interfering node on the UAV communications by considering the LoS probability and different channel fading for LoS and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links, which are affected by horizontal and vertical distances of the communication link. We then derive a closed-form outage probability in the presence of an interfering node for all the possible scenarios and environments of main and interference links. After discussing the impacts of transmitting and interfering node parameters on the outage probability, we show the existence of the optimal height of the UAV that minimizes the outage probability. We also show the NLoS environment can be better than the LoS environment if the average received power of the interference is more dominant than that of the transmitting signal on UAV communications. Finally, we analyze the network outage probability for the case of multiple interfering nodes using stochastic geometry and the outage probability of the single interfering node case, and show the effect of the interfering node density on the optimal height of the UAV.",Drone,2019
Operator Strategy Model Development in UAV Hacking Detection,"An increasingly relevant security issue for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, also known as drones) is the possibility of a global positioning system (GPS) spoofing attack. Given the existing problems in current GPS spoofing detection techniques and human visual advantages in searching and localizing targets, we propose a human-autonomy collaborative approach of human geo-location to assist UAV control systems in detecting GPS spoofing attacks. An interactive testbed and experiment were designed and used to evaluate this approach, which demonstrated that human-autonomy collaborative hacking detection is a viable concept. Using the hidden Markov model (HMM) approach, operator behavior patterns and strategies from the experiment were modeled via hidden states and transitions among them. These models revealed two dominant hacking detection strategies. Statistical results and expert performer evaluations show no significant difference between different hacking detection strategies in terms of correct detection. The detection strategy model suggests areas of future research in decision support tool design for UAV hacking detection. Also, the development of HMMs presents the feasibility of quantitatively investigating operator behavior patterns and strategies in human supervisory control scenarios.",Drone,2019
Distributed intelligent self-organized mission planning of multi-UAV for dynamic targets cooperative search-attack,"This article studies the cooperative search-attack mission problem with dynamic targets and threats, and presents a Distributed Intelligent Self-Organized Mission Planning (DISOMP) algorithm for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (multi-UAV). The DISOMP algorithm can be divided into four modules: a search module designed based on the distributed Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, an attack module designed based on the Parallel Approach (PA) scheme, a threat avoidance module designed based on the Dubins Curve (DC) and a communication module designed for information exchange among the multi-UAV system and the dynamic environment. A series of simulations of multi-UAV searching and attacking the moving targets are carried out, in which the search-attack mission completeness, execution efficiency and system suitability of the DISOMP algorithm are analyzed. The simulation results exhibit that the DISOMP algorithm based on online distributed down-top strategy is characterized by good flexibility, scalability and adaptability, in the dynamic targets searching and attacking problem.

'Targeted killing' and the lack of acquiescence,"Over the last decade, the concept targeted killing has received much attention in debates on the customary interpretation of the right to self-defence, particularly in the context of practices such as US armed drone attacks. In these debates, government silence has often been invoked as acquiescence to the jus ad bellum aspects of targeted killing. Focusing on the question of state silence on targeted killing practices by the Israeli and US governments in recent years, this article investigates over 900 UN Security Council and Human Rights Council debates and argues that there has been no tacit consent to targeted killing. The analysis firstly shows that the majority of states have condemned Israeli targeted killing practices and have raised concerns about armed drone attacks, while falling short of directly protesting against US practices. The article, secondly, applies the customary international law requirements for acquiescence and challenges the idea that silence on US armed drone attacks can be understood as a legal stance towards targeted killing. The article, finally, investigates the political context and engages with alternative interpretations of silence. Contextualizing acts of protest and lack of protest within an asymmetrical political context, the article posits that the invocation of silence as acquiescence in the case of targeted killing is problematic and risks complicity of legal knowledge production with the violence of hegemonic actors.",Drone,2019
Rigorous Calibration of UAV-Based LiDAR Systems with Refinement of the Boresight Angles Using a Point-to-Plane Approach,"Advances in micro-electro-mechanical navigation systems and lightweight LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide the feasibility of deriving point clouds with very high and homogeneous point density. However, the deformations caused by numerous sources of errors should be carefully treated. This work presents a rigorous calibration of UAV-based LiDAR systems with refinement of the boresight angles using a point-to-plane approach. Our method is divided into a calibration and a parameter mounting refinement part. It starts with the estimation of the calibration parameters and then refines the boresight angles. The novel contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, we estimate the calibration parameters conditioning the centroid of a plane segmented to lie on its corresponding segmented plane without an additional surveying campaign. Second, we refine the boresight angles using a new point-to-plane model. The proposed method is evaluated by analyzing the accuracy assessment of the adjusted point cloud to point/planar features before and after the proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, our proposed method achieves better positional accuracy.",Drone,2019

"Drones, Surveillance, and Violence: Theory and Evidence from a US Drone Program","We investigate the impact of the US drone program in Pakistan on insurgent violence. Using details about US-Pakistan counterterrorism cooperation and geocoded violence data, we show that the program was associated with monthly reductions of around nine to thirteen insurgent attacks and fifty-one to eighty-six casualties in the area affected by the program. This change was sizable, as in the year before the program, the affected area experienced around twenty-one attacks and one hundred casualties per month. Additional quantitative and qualitative evidence suggests that this drop is attributable to the drone program. However, the damage caused in strikes during the program cannot fully account for the reduction. Instead, anticipatory effects induced by the program played a prominent role in subduing violence. These effects stemmed from the insurgents' perception of the risk of being targeted in drone strikes; their efforts to avoid targeting severely compromised their movement and communication abilities, in addition to eroding within-group trust. These findings contrast with prominent perspectives on air-power, counterinsurgency, and US counterterrorism, suggesting select drone deployments can be an effective tool of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism.",Drone,2019
Software-Defined Networking for Unmanned Aerial Vehicular Networking and Security: A Survey,"Despite the immense benefits offered by the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in civilian and military applications, significant work needs to be done to ensure that these systems are able to securely communicate and resiliently operate to accomplish the mission. As the UAVs grow with their popularity and usability for different applications, there is a dire need to ensure that UAVs and their networks are capable of mitigating cyber-attacks on the fly. One approach that has gained considerable popularity is Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based solutions. SDN is a networking paradigm that has gained attention due to its dynamic flexibility to program networks and increase network visibility, and its potential to assist in the mitigating security vulnerabilities in the network including the network of UAVs. This article provides an overview of recent advances, and current state of art related to security vulnerabilities and SDN enabled countermeasures.

Moral Values Related to Autonomous Weapon Systems: An Empirical Survey that Reveals Common Ground for the Ethical Debate,"In the political debate on Autonomous Weapon Systems strong views and opinions are voiced, but empirical research to support these opinions is lacking. Insight into which moral values are related to the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems is missing. We describe the empirical results of two studies on moral values regarding Autonomous Weapon Systems that aim to understand the perception of people pertaining to the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems. One study consists of a sample of military personnel of the Dutch Ministry of Defense and the second study contains a sample of civilians. The results indicate both groups are more anxious about the deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems than about the deployment of Human Operated drones, and that they perceive Autonomous Weapon Systems to have less respect for the dignity of human life. The concerns for Autonomous Weapon Systems creating new kinds of psychological and moral harm is very present in the public debate, and this is in our opinion one element that deserves to be carefully considered in future debates on the ethics of the design and deployment of Autonomous Weapon Systems. The results of these studies reveal a common ground regarding the moral values of < italic > human dignity </italic > and < italic > anxiety </italic > pertaining the introduction of Autonomous Weapon Systems which could further the ethical debate.",Drone,2019
Optimal Evading Strategies and Task Allocation in Multi-player Pursuit-Evasion Problems,"Pursuit-evasion problems involving multiple pursuers and evaders are studied in this paper. The pursuers and the evaders are all assumed to be identical, and the pursuers are assumed to follow either a constant bearing or a pure pursuit strategy, giving rise to two distinct cases. The problem is simplified by adopting a dynamic divide and conquer approach, where at every time instant each evader is assigned to a set of pursuers based on the instantaneous positions of all the players. In this regard, the corresponding multi-pursuer single-evader problem is analyzed first. Assuming that the evader knows the positions of all the pursuers and their pursuit strategy, the time-optimal evading strategies are derived for both constant bearing and pure pursuit cases for the pursuers using tools from optimal control theory. In the case of a constant bearing strategy, and assuming that the evader can follow any strategy, a dynamic task allocation algorithm is proposed for the pursuers. The algorithm is based on the well-known Apollonius circle and allows the pursuers to allocate their resources in an intelligent manner while guaranteeing the capture of the evader in minimum time. For the case of pure pursuit, the algorithm is modified using the counterpart of the Apollonius circle leading to an ""Apollonius closed curve."" Finally, the proposed algorithms are extended to assign pursuers in the case of a problem with multiple pursuers and multiple evaders. Numerical simulations are included to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.",Drone,2019
Robust Visual Detection and Tracking Strategies for Autonomous Aerial Refueling of UAVs,"In this paper, we propose a robust detection and tracking strategy for autonomous aerial refueling of unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed framework includes two modules: a faster deep-learning-based detector (DLD) and a more accurate reinforcement-learning-based tracker (RLT). In the detection stage, the DLD achieves faster speed by combining the efficient MoblieNet with the you only look once framework. In the tracking stage, RLT is proposed to obtain target's position accurately and fastly by performing hierarchically positioning and adjusting target bounding box according to the reinforcement learning. The precision of drogue object tracking is 98.7, which is obviously higher than the other comparison methods. The speed of our network can achieve 15 frames/s on GPU Titan X. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework.",Drone,2019
Modeling framework for analyzing midair encounters in hybrid airspace where manned and unmanned aircraft coexist,"The integration of unmanned aircraft system into nonsegregated airspace raises safety concerns of midair encounters in the hybrid airspace where manned and unmanned aircraft coexist. This paper aims at developing a new modeling framework with improved modeling capability and feasibility for analyzing the midair encounters in hybrid airspace. This modeling framework includes models of different components (airspace, human pilot, manned aircraft, unmanned aircraft, etc.) involved in midair encounters. As a key component, human pilot is modeled to contain different information processing stages which are perception, decision making and response. Meanwhile, the modeling framework is designed to provide quantitative measures of midair encounters in hybrid airspace, and further uses ""Equal Level of Safety"" criterion to evaluate the validity of the integration of the unmanned aircraft system. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework are demonstrated through simulation studies.",Drone,2019
Offense-defense confrontation decision making for dynamic UAV swarm versus UAV swarm,"This paper studies a dynamic swarm versus swarm unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) combat problem and proposes a self-organized offense-defense confrontation decision-making (ODCDM) algorithm. This ODCDM algorithm adopts the distributed architecture to account for real-time implementation, where each UAV is treated as an agent and able to solve its local decision problem through the information exchange with neighbors. At each decision making step, the swarm seeks an optimal target allocation scheme and each UAV further selects the corresponding behavioral rules, leading to emergent offensive and defensive behaviors. Therefore, the offense-defense confrontation decision-making process is divided into the target allocation decision based on distributed consensus-based auction algorithm (CBAA) and social-force-based swarm motion decision. An offense-defense preference is introduced to the target allocation optimization model, providing the tactics options for UAV to adopt more offensive or more defensive posture. On the basis of classic collective behaviors of cohesion, separation and alignment, a combat stimulus is considered to drive UAV towards the assigned target. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the ODCDM algorithm, and analyze the influences of the external deployment and internal tactics on the combat results.",Drone,2019
Accurate Analysis of Target Data and Transmission of Measuring Information Security by Airborne Photoelectric Platform,"Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft can acquire data by remote sensing. The photoelectric imaging platform of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is mounted on the UAV, which uses photogrammetry, image processing and other technologies to accurately analyze the target of interest. With the continuous development of technology, people's requirement for target positioning accuracy is increasing. At the same time, the airborne optoelectronic platform meets the characteristics of wireless sensor networks and needs to deploy key management scheme to ensure the security of data transmission. In this study, coordinate transformation method is used to generate a photoelectric imaging target positioning scheme, based on which the factors affecting the accuracy of target data are analyzed. Using the idea of Monte Carlo algorithm and MatLab simulation, the attitude angle of aircraft and the angle error of gyroscope affect the accuracy of target data. In order to improve the security of data transmission, the identity authentication scheme of Elliptic Curve (ECC) is taken as the research object of key management scheme in this study. Considering the limited resources of wireless sensor networks, a combined public key+identity encryption scheme is proposed. In the simulation process, the scheme shows good performance in encryption/decryption overhead, and the length of ciphertext/private key is controllable. This research is helpful for the airborne photoelectric platform to measure the target data better and ensure the security of data transmission.",Drone,2019
The contribution of force feedback to human performance in the teleoperation of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles,"The availability of additional force cues in haptic devices are often expected to improve control performance, over conditions that only provide visual feedback. However, there is little empirical evidence to show this to be true for the teleoperation control of remote vehicles [i.e., multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)]. In this paper, the contribution of haptic force feedback cues to the teleoperation of multiple UAVs was evaluated. These cues were based on either the UAVs' velocity or directed forces from sensed obstacles. Both induced improved teleoperator perception of the remote environment. However, velocity-based cues resulted in more effortful maneuvering.",Drone,2019
Ground Attack Strategy of Cooperative UAVs for Multitargets,"Humans have a fundamental ability, that is, to share vision among each other to fulfill common goals, which cooperative UAVs do not have. The difficulties mainly lie in the homologous mathematical description of humans and elusive experimental practice. This paper proposed a parallel multiview splicing on clouds, which first review both theory and practice studies in UAVs. These terms are then reconsidered from humans' vision sharing. Next, a conceptual model of parallel multiview splicing on clouds is proposed and the mathematical deduction if fulfilled. Furthermore, an experimental cooperative UAVs platform is built to practically implement the algorithms. Both the simulated and practiced results have validated the feasibility of our method. Finally, a general discussion and proposals for addressing future issues are given.",Drone,2019
PB: A Message Transmission Method Based on Area Layer Division in UAV Networks,"A search and rescue mission is a typical UAV network application scenario. In this case, it is necessary to deliver messages quickly and efficiently to the ground station through mutual cooperation between UAVs. Many methods used in this case have problems such as unbalanced popularity (the ratio of the relayed message number to the total message number) of nodes, large proportion of ping-pong effect, and long delay. In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a method named PB (Popularity Balance Method for UAVs in the same area layer) based on division of the whole search area. The method divides the search area into multiple area layers. Message transmission between area layers adopts a geographical routing manner, that is, messages are transmitted to the area layer closer to the ground station. The division of the search area changes the pattern of message transmission. Messages are delivered to the area layer closer to the destination node rather than the node closer to the destination. The pattern causes messages' passing direction to be replaced by ""point-to-point closer"" to ""point-to-face closer."" On the basis of message transmission at area layers, reasonable planning of UAVs' distribution can effectively improve the network performance deterioration caused by a ""hot spot."" Both analysis and experiments show that PB is superior to some existing methods in popularity balance of nodes and ping-pong effect. In addition, experiments also show that it gets better results in targets of delay, delivery rate, and hop count.",Drone,2019
Impact of mission requirements on the design of low observable UCAV configurations,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to characterise the effects of mission and performance parameters on the design space of low observable subsonic unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) operating in typical Hi-Lo-Hi ground strike missions. Design/methodology/approach Conceptual design methodologies appropriate to low observable, tailless UCAVs have been integrated into a multidisciplinary aircraft design environment, GENUS, developed at Cranfield University's aircraft design group. A basic Hi-Lo-Hi mission is designed and a baseline configuration is established through the GENUS framework. Subsequently, an evolutionary optimiser and a robust gradient-based optimiser are used to obtain convergent design solutions for various leading edge sweep angles, mission ranges, cruise Mach numbers and other operational constraints. Findings The results indicate that performance constraints, specifically in the form of specific excess power (SEP), have a large influence on the overall sizing of subsonic tailless UCAVs. This requirement drives the engine sizing, which represents a considerable proportion of the empty and gross mass of the vehicle. Cruise Mach number studies show that no significant advantages exist for operating at low speeds while maintaining performance requirements consistent with combat missions. There is a drastic increase in the vehicle's mass and thrust requirements for flight speeds above Mach 0.8, with low sweep configurations showing a more pronounced effect. Increases in the range are not overly dependent on the leading edge sweep angle. Top-level radar cross section (RCS) results also favour configurations with higher leading edge sweep angles, especially from the nose-on aspect. Finally, research and development costs are shown to be directly linked to engine size. Originality/value This research shows the use of an integrated aircraft design environment that incorporates aerodynamics, performance, packaging and low observability aspects into the optimisation loop. Through this methodology, this study supports the efforts towards characterising and establishing alternate visions of the future of aerial warfare through the use of low cost, survivable unmanned platforms in network-centric cooperative tasks.",Drone,2019
Victim Localization in USAR Scenario Exploiting Multi-Layer Mapping Structure,"Urban search and rescue missions require rapid intervention to locate victims and survivors in the affected environments. To facilitate this activity, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently used to explore the environment and locate possible victims. In this paper, a UAV equipped with multiple complementary sensors is used to detect the presence of a human in an unknown environment. A novel human localization approach in unknown environments is proposed that merges information gathered from deep-learning-based human detection, wireless signal mapping, and thermal signature mapping to build an accurate global human location map. A next-best-view (NBV) approach with a proposed multi-objective utility function is used to iteratively evaluate the map to locate the presence of humans rapidly. Results demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms other methods in several performance measures such as the number of iterations, entropy reduction, and traveled distance.",Drone,2019
Tree-Based Attack-Defense Model for Risk Assessment in Multi-UAV Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks are attack-prone networks due to high mobility and distributed nature. Most of the existing approaches focus on prevention instead of analyzing the security vulnerabilities. For an efficient analysis, the interaction between attackers and defenders need to be investigated. Hence, a tree-based attack-defense model for security analysis of multi-UAV networks has been discussed in this paper. An attack-defense tree has been designed that depicts every move of the defender with respect to the attacker's strategies. Using this attack-defense tree, a game theoretic scheme for risk assessment is formulated. The efficiency of the proposed scheme has been evaluated using a case study for the distributed denial-of-service attack.",Drone,2019
Secrecy Transmission in Large-Scale UAV-Enabled Wireless Networks,"This paper considers the secrecy transmission in a large-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless network, in which a set of UAVs in the sky transmit confidential information to their respective legitimate receivers on the ground, in the presence of another set of randomly distributed suspicious ground eavesdroppers. We assume that the horizontal locations of legitimate receivers and eavesdroppers are distributed as two independent homogeneous Possion point processes (PPPs), and each of the UAVs is positioned exactly above its corresponding legitimate receiver for efficient secrecy communication. Furthermore, we consider an elevation-angle-dependent line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS (NLoS) path-loss model for air-to-ground (A2G) wireless channels and employ the wiretap code for secrecy transmission. Under such setups, we first characterize the secrecy communication performance (in terms of the connection probability, secrecy outage probability, and secrecy transmission capacity) in mathematically tractable forms, and accordingly optimize the system configurations (i.e., the wiretap code rates and UAV positioning altitude) to maximize the secrecy transmission capacity, subject to a maximum secrecy outage probability constraint. Next, we propose to use the secrecy guard zone technique for further secrecy protection, and analyze the correspondingly achieved secrecy communication performance. Finally, we present numerical results to validate the theoretical analysis. It is shown that the employment of secrecy guard zone significantly improves the secrecy transmission capacity of this network, and the desirable guard zone radius generally decreases monotonically as the UAVs' and/or the eavesdroppers' densities increase.",Drone,2019
UAPM: An Urgency-Aware Packet Management for Disaster Management Using Flying Ad-Hoc Networks,"The ever increasing demand of ad-hoc networks for adaptive topology and mobility aware communication led to new paradigm of networking among Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) known as Flying ad-hoc Networks (FANETs). Due to their dynamic topology, FANETs can be deployed for disaster monitoring and surveillance applications. During these operations, UAVs need to transmit different disaster data, which consists of different types of data packets. Among them there are packets which need to be transmitted urgently because of the emergency situation in disaster management. To handle this situation, we propose a methodology of disaster data classification using urgency level and based on these urgency levels, priority index is assigned to data packets. An approach of Urgency Aware Scheduling (UAS) is proposed to efficiently transmit high and low priority packets with minimum delays in transmission queue. We take into account different scenarios of UAVs for disaster management and for N number of UAVs, we propose bio-inspired mechanism using behavioral study of bird flocking for cluster formation and maintenance. Furthermore, we propose a priority based route selection methodology for data communication in FANET cluster. Simulation results show that our proposed mechanism shows better performance in the presence of evaluation benchmarks like average delay, queuing time, forward percentage and fairness.",Drone,2019
Dreams and Realities of Arms Control,"Against the background of the comprehensive crisis of the nuclear arms control treaties three new principle schools of strategic thinking have emerged and are affecting the governments of the great powers. One of them is ¡°neo-hawks¡±, who are claiming that disarmament agreements are detrimental by hindering the development of new nuclear arms, which have once again become an effective tool of policy and war after deep reductions during the last thirty years. These experts advocate new programs of nuclear, conventional, and dual purpose weapon systems and elaborate strategic concepts of limited nuclear warfare, controlled escalation, and victory in a nuclear war. Another school - ¡°idealists¡± who call for ending with nuclear weapons by a single grand treaty of the kind they managed to promote in the UN in 2017 - the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. The third school is ¡°revisionists¡± who argue that nuclear multipolarity, proliferation and new military technologies (hypersonic missiles, cyber warfare, long-range armed drones, space weapons, etc.) have made traditional arms control outdated. They propose to revise the notions of parity and strategic stability, the practice of nuclear arms reductions and limitations, numerical ceilings and meticulous verification procedures. As a replacement they promote the idea of various multilateral dialogues with the goal of enhancing mutual nuclear deterrence, predictability, and trust among nations. A closer scrutiny demonstrates extreme danger of the first type of thinking which is leading to a nuclear war. The second school¡¯s idea, for all good intentions of its authors, is impossible to implement. It mistakenly treats nuclear disarmament as a technical issue, while it is an extremely complex political and strategic problem. The third group may do still more harm by persuading state leaders and public opinion that the collapse of the arms control is not dangerous: allegedly it is possible to enhance security without long and exhausting negotiations and complex agreements. In contrast to the above ideas, provided political will of the leaderships of the major nations, it is still possible to save or revive some important treaties and move forward addressing many novel weapons and technologies by arms control talks. Dynamic changes of the world order, military hard- and software, and strategic thinking - all these are making arms control more vital for the Russian and international security than ever before.",Drone,2019
Cyber-physical battlefield perception systems based on machine learning technology for data delivery,"Data delivery in Cyber-Physical Battlefield Perception Systems(CPBPS) is a challenging task due to the ubiquity locations and the high mobility of node. Due to the special geographical circumstances, communication networks based on fixed infrastructure are unlikely to be established. This paper presents an air-ground coordination communication transmission network, which consists of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) subnets and ground vehicle subnets. The UAVs exploit air-to-air (A2A) and air-to-ground (A2G) communication links to assist vehicle communications. However, overreliance on satellite positioning may cause military information to leak. Therefore, we proposed a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN )combined with genetic algorithms and based on machine learning system (MLS) for data delivery for battlefield environment to realize the privacy protection and guarantee the security with better prediction. The proposed KNN machine learning system can estimate the movement and path of vehicles based on the mobile information obtained. Furthermore, in order to transmit data of UAVs more efficiently, the genetic algorithms (GA) is utilized to determine the relative location of UAVs. Simulation results verify the performance of proposed algorithm.",Drone,2019
Secrecy Performance Analysis of Wireless Communications in the Presence of UAV Jammer and Randomly Located UAV Eavesdroppers,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been undergoing fast development for providing broader signal coverage and more extensive surveillance capabilities in military and civilian applications. Due to the broadcast nature of the wireless signal and the openness of the space, UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs) pose a potential threat to ground communications. In this paper, we consider the communications of a legitimate ground link in the presence of friendly jamming and UEDs within a finite area of space. The spatial distribution of the UEDs obeying a uniform binomial point process (BPP) is used to characterize the randomness of the UEDs. The ground link is assumed to experience log-distance path loss and Rayleigh fading, while free space path loss with/without the averaged excess path loss clue to the environment is used for the air-to-ground/air-to-air links. A piecewise function is proposed to approximate the line-of-sight (LoS) probability for the air-to-ground links, which provides a better approximation than using the existing sigmoid-based fitting. The analytic l expression for the secure connection probability (SCP) of the legitimate ground link in the presence of non-colluding UEDs is derived. The analysis reveals some useful trends in the SCP as a function of the transmit signal to jamming power ratio, the locations of the UAV jammer, and the height of UAVs.",Drone,2019
An Innovative Technique for Identification of Missing Persons in Natural Disaster Based on Drone-Femtocell Systems,"The recent development of the IoT (Internet of Things), which has enabled new types of sensors that can be easily interconnected to the Internet, will also have a significant impact in the near future on the management of natural disasters (mainly earthquakes and floods) with the aim of improving effectiveness in research, identification, and recovery of missing persons, and therefore increasing the possibility of saving lives. In this paper, more specifically, an innovative technique is proposed for the search and identification of missing persons in natural disaster scenarios by employing a drone-femtocell system and devising an algorithm capable of locating any mobile terminal in a given monitoring area. In particular, through a series of power measurements based on the reference signal received power (RSRP), the algorithm allows for the classification of the terminal inside or outside the monitoring area and subsequently identify the position with an accuracy of about 1 m, even in the presence of obstacles that act in such a way as to make the propagation of the radio signal non-isotropic.",Drone,2019
UAV-Enabled Secure Communications: Joint Trajectory and Transmit Power Optimization,"This paper studies the physical layer security of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, where a UAV base station (UAV-B) transmits confidential information to multiple information receivers (IRs) with the aid of a UAV jammer (UAV-J) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the trajectories and transmit power of UAV-B and UAV-J in order to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate over all IRs. The optimization problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are coupled, which leads to the optimization problem being mathematically intractable. As such, we decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems and then solve it by employing an alternating iterative algorithm and the successive convex approximation technique. Our results show that the average secrecy rate performance of the proposed scheme provides about 20% and 150% performance gains over the joint trajectory and transmit power optimization without UAV-J scheme and the transmit power optimization with fixed trajectory scheme at flight period T = 150 s, respectively.",Drone,2019
Joint Trajectory and Communication Design for Secure UAV Networks,"This letter investigates a joint optimization problem of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flight trajectory, downlink transmission power, and ground terminals (GTs) association under wiretap channels. Specifically, we consider a scenario where a UAV serves a group of GTs and maximizes the minimum secrecy rate to ensure the fairness among GTs. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, we develop an iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation and alternating methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and can significantly improve the minimum secrecy rate compared with the traditional flight scheme.",Drone,2019
Systematic Medium Access Control in Hierarchical Airborne Networks With Multibeam and Single-Beam Antennas,"A heterogeneous medium access control (MAC) scheme (with both scheduled and random communications) is proposed for airborne networks. These networks have a hierarchical topology with a small number of powerful aircraft nodes with multibeam antennas and long-distance links at the higher level, and high-density unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) nodes with single-beam directional antennas at the lower level. Our proposed MAC scheme has the following three parts: First, multibeam, long-distanceMAC for aircraft to aircraft links: a dynamic, scheduled MAC is proposed to take advantage of the multibeam features to achieve high-throughput transmissions, and the beam locking/ synchronization issues are solved; second, uplink MAC for UAV to aircraft communication: conventional IEEE 802.11n MAC is enhanced with fame aggregation and compressive-sensingbased request polling; and third, MAC for UAV to UAV links: IEEE 802.11e DCF MAC is enhanced through parameter adjustment for channel access. Our simulation results show the significant performance improvement over conventional MAC protocols.",Drone,2019
Sliding Mode Guidance and Control for UAV Carrier Landing,"A guidance and control system is proposed for automatic carrier landing of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To this end, the position and attitude of the carrier is predicted by considering the sea state so that the UAV guidance loop can be compensated during the final approach phase. The landing kinematics and reference trajectory are determined using the predicted touchdown position. Nonlinear guidance and control laws are designed based on a sliding-mode control scheme to make the UAV robustly follow the reference trajectory.",Drone,2019
Stochastic Observability and Uncertainty Characterization in Simultaneous Receiver and Transmitter Localization,"The stochastic observability of simultaneous receiver and transmitter localization is studied. A mobile vehicle-mounted receiver is assumed to draw pseudorange measurements from multiple unknown radio frequency transmitters and to fuse these measurements through an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to simultaneously localize the receiver and transmitters together with estimating the receiver's and transmitters' clock errors. The receiver is assumed to have perfect a priori knowledge of its initial states, while the transmitters' states are unknown. It is shown that the receiver's and transmitters' clock biases are stochastically unobservable and that their estimation error variances will diverge. A lower bound on the divergence rate of the estimation error variances of the receiver's and transmitters' clock biases is derived and demonstrated numerically. Simulation and experimental results are presented for an unmanned aerial vehicle navigating without GPS signals, using pseudoranges made on unknown terrestrial transmitters. It is demonstrated that despite the receiver's and transmitters' clock biases being stochastically unobservable, the EKF produces bounded localization errors.",Drone,2019
Secure UAV-to-UAV Systems With Spatially Random UAVs,"In this letter, we investigate the secrecy performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-to-UAV system, where a UAV acts as the source (S) transmitting information to a legitimate UAV receiver while a group of UAVs trying to eavesdrop the information delivery between S and legitimate UAV receiver. The locations of the legitimate UAV receiver and the eavesdropping UAVs are randomly distributed in the coverage space of S. We first characterize the statistical characteristics of the signal-to-noise ratio over S to the legitimate UAV receiver links; and then the closed-form analytical expressions for secrecy outage probability and the average secrecy capacity have also been derived accordingly. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are carried out to verify our proposed analytical models.",Drone,2019
Trajectory-following guidance based on a virtual target and an angle constraint,"In this paper, a new trajectory-following guidance scheme based on the combination of the virtual target concept and a missile terminal guidance law is proposed. A line-of-sight (LOS) angle constraint is derived for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to track a virtual target moving along the reference trajectory, by which the trajectory-following problem is transformed into an angle-constrained terminal guidance problem such that well-developed terminal guidance laws can be incorporated into the design of a trajectory-following guidance scheme. The nonsingular sliding mode technique is employed to control the vehicle's LOS angle to converge to its desired value and thus to tightly track the reference trajectory. In addition, the finite-time trajectory-following position error convergence of the proposed guidance scheme is presented. The significant contribution of this paper lies in the fact that a LOS angle constraint has been presented for a virtual-target-based trajectory-following scheme, greatly enhancing the flexibility of the design of the trajectory-following guidance scheme. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the proposed guidance law and its superiority over existing trajectory-following guidance laws. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ADMOST: UAV Flight Data Anomaly Detection and Mitigation via Online Subspace Tracking,"Since the control laws require sensor feedback to set the current dynamic state of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), incorrect readings may lead to potentially catastrophic conditions. Thus, automated detection and mitigation of UAV flight data anomaly is an important problem in the aviation domain. However, the conventional anomaly detection algorithms simply detect the outlier points and cannot provide estimated values. To address this challenge, anomaly detection and mitigation algorithm based on online subspace tracking, an online algorithm for flight data anomaly detection and mitigation is proposed. At every time instant, data subspace matrix is used as a meaningful data representation of raw multivariate heterogeneous flight data. Besides, in terms of outlier points, the subspace matrix is tracked with incomplete partial observation. Anomaly score is calculated based on the identification of a change in the underlying subspace. Utilizing the tracked subspace matrix, the detected outlier points are replaced with reasonable recovered estimations, which will help mitigate the influence of anomaly to UAV system control. Experimental results on real UAV flight data demonstrate its ability to maintain high accuracy for anomaly detection and low error for data recovery.",Drone,2019
El dispositivo del dron: entre la vigilancia securitaria y la necropol¨ªtica,"Abstract: Moving away from the growing techno-scientific fascination embodied by the drone, the main aim is to analyze the role played by this device in the context of the current security surveillance. Following to a great extent the conceptual approaches coming from critical security studies, we will address issues that refer to the redefinition of the surveillance provided by the scopic power of the drone, the military-police logics in which it is immersed in order to detect what has been defined as a threat and, finally, to the specific geographical reconfiguration of the sovereign power the drone activates within the framework of security surveillance. It will be concluded that, opposing the surgical warfare discourse that legitimizes the drone via its techno-scientific accuracy potential, this device reproduces a necro-political logic that must be exhibited and questioned from the violence it causes.",Drone,2019
Combination of wavelet transform and singular value decomposition-based contrast enhancement technique for target detection in UAV reconnaissance thermal images,"In Aerial surveillance, thermal images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are greatly affected due to various external interferences, which results in a low contrast image. Widely used conventional contrast enhancement methods such as histogram equalization and dynamic range partitioning techniques suffer from severe brightness changes and reduced sharpness, which in turn fail to preserve the edge details of the image. Thus for efficient target detection, it is essential to develop effective thermal infrared image contrast and edge enhancement technique. In this paper, wavelet transform (WT) and singular value decomposition (SVD)-based image enhancement technique is attempted for the target detection using thermal images captured by UAV. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT), stationary wavelet transform (SWT) and SVD are used for texture feature enhancement, edge enhancement and illumination correction, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed technique yields higher entropy (6.7485), EMEE (2.1212), MSSIM (0.8719) and lower AMBE (21.9049) values when compared to other existing techniques.",Drone,2019
"Visual detection and tracking with UAVs, following a mobile object","Conception and development of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) capable of detecting, tracking and following a moving object with unknown dynamics is presented in this work, considering a human face as a case of study. Object detection is accomplished by a Haar cascade classifier. Once an object is detected, it is tracked with the help of a Kalman Filter (KF), and an estimation of the relative position with respect to the target is obtained. A linear controller is used to validate the proposed vision scheme and for regulating the aerial robot's position in order to keep a constant distance with respect to the mobile target, employing as well the extra available information from the embedded sensors. The proposed system was extensively tested in real-time experiments, through different conditions, using a commercial quadcopter connected via wireless to a ground station running under the Robot Operative System (ROS). The proposed overall strategy shows a good performance even under disadvantageous conditions as outdoor flight, being robust against illumination changes, image noise and the presence of other people in the scene.",Drone,2019
Battlefield Responses to New Technologies: Views from the Ground on Unmanned Aircraft,"How do individuals on the battlefield respond to the introduction of new technologies? How will unmanned and increasingly autonomous technologies be received by ground combat personnel? In this paper we explore tactical-level perceptions of one particular technology-armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-by conducting a survey experiment of ground fires controllers. Our findings reveal that these personnel have strong behavioral reactions to the introduction of unmanned technology. Especially in situations with high risk to ground troops, we find a strong preference for manned aircraft with implications for the future use of UAVs and human-machine relationships in war. These results suggest the need to incorporate behavioral variables into future studies of military adoption and innovation and indicate that the future adoption of unmanned systems may be just as much about the ""warm fuzzy"" of trust as confidence in unmanned capabilities.",Drone,2019
Space-time cloaks through birefringent Goos-Hanchen shifts,"We report a theoretical demonstration for the creation of space-time holes based on birefringence of reflection, transmission, and the Goos-Hachen (GH) shifts from a chiral medium. We observed space-time holes in the reflection, transmission, and their corresponding GH-shifted beams. Two space-time holes are clearly detected in the regions of 0 < t <= 5 tau(0) and -5w <= y <= 5w, as well as in the regions of -5 tau(0) <= t <= 0 and -5w <= y <= 5w. These space-time holes hide objects and information contents from observers and hackers. The objects and information contents are completely undetectable, and thus events can be cloaked. The results of this paper have potential applications in the invisibility of drone technology and secure communication of information in telecom industries.",Drone,2019
Semantically Enhanced UAVs to Increase the Aerial Scene Understanding,"Visual tracking supported by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has generated a lot of interest in recent years, especially in application domains such as surveillance, search for missing persons and traffic monitoring. The major challenges in visual tracking with small UAVs arise in the form of target representation, target appearance change, target detection and localization in real time computation. Reliable target detection depends on factors such as occlusions, image noise, illumination and pose changes, or image blur that may compromise the object labeling. To mitigate these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid solution: along with the tracked objects, scenes are completely depicted by adding contextual information, i.e., data describing places, natural features, or in general points of interest. Each scenario indeed is semantically described by ontological statements that define the context and then, by inference, support the object tracking task in the object identification and labeling. The synergy between the tracking methods and semantic modeling can bridge the object labeling gap, enhancing the scene understanding and awareness when alarming situations are discovered. Experimental results are promising and confirm the applicability of the proposed framework in supporting drones in object identification and critical situation detection tasks.",Drone,2019
Optimized deployment of a radar network based on an improved firefly algorithm,"The threats and challenges of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) invasion defense due to rapid UAV development have attracted increased attention recently. One of the important UAV invasion defense methods is radar network detection. To form a tight and reliable radar surveillance network with limited resources, it is essential to investigate optimized radar network deployment. This optimization problem is difficult to solve due to its nonlinear features and strong coupling of multiple constraints. To address these issues, we propose an improved firefly algorithm that employs a neighborhood learning strategy with a feedback mechanism and chaotic local search by elite fireflies to obtain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation abilities. Moreover, a chaotic sequence is used to generate initial firefly positions to improve population diversity. Experiments have been conducted on 12 famous benchmark functions and in a classical radar deployment scenario. Results indicate that our approach achieves much better performance than the classical firefly algorithm (FA) and four recently proposed FA variants.",Drone,2019
Time synchronization requirement of global navigation satellite system augmentation system based on pseudolite,"Global navigation satellite systems are widely used across the world because of their continuous/all-weather, global coverage, and high precision positioning. But, three-dimensional positioning accuracy, especially in the vertical direction, remains insufficient because of the geometric distribution of satellites. This is especially true for air-borne objects such as unmanned aerial vehicles, civil aviation devices, and missiles. To solve this problem, we adopt a satellite-ground joint positioning system based on a pseudo-satellite (pseudolite). The introduction of ground pseudolites can significantly reduce the vertical dilution of precision and improve positioning accuracy. This method has been proposed in the 1980s. However, we have to ask a question, as long as we add a pseudolite, can the positioning accuracy be improved? The answer is no. Pseudolites can cause time synchronization problems with satellites, and the resulting timing errors of the pseudolite are converted into pseudorange errors, reducing accuracy. Here, we seek to evaluate the impact of the reduced vertical dilution of precision and the increased range errors associated with the introduction of a pseudolite on the ground. We derive a mathematical formula to explain this relationship. We conclude that when the satellite range error and the change in the position dilution of precision associated with a pseudolite are known, we can calculate an approximate limit for the pseudolite timing accuracy to ensure that the use of the pseudolite improves the positioning accuracy. This work should be of great value in guiding engineering practice.",Drone,2019
Suspended load path tracking control using a tilt-rotor UAV based on zonotopic state estimation,"This work addresses the problem of path tracking control of a suspended load using a tilt-rotor UAV. The main challenge in controlling this kind of system arises from the dynamic behavior imposed by the load, which is usually coupled to the UAV by means of a rope, adding unactuated degrees of freedom to the whole system. Furthermore, to perform the load transportation it is often needed the knowledge of the load position to accomplish the task. Since available sensors are commonly embedded in the mobile platform, information on the load position may not be directly available. To solve this problem in this work, initially, the kinematics of the multi-body mechanical system are formulated from the load's perspective, from which a detailed dynamic model is derived using the Euler-Lagrange approach, yielding a highly coupled, nonlinear state-space representation of the system, affine in the inputs, with the load's position and orientation directly represented by state variables. A zonotopic state estimator is proposed to solve the problem of estimating the load position and orientation, which is formulated based on sensors located at the aircraft, with different sampling times, and unknown-but-bounded measurement noise. To solve the path tracking problem, a discrete-time mixed H-2/H-infinity controller with pole-placement constraints is designed with guaranteed time-response properties and robust to unmodeled dynamics, parametric uncertainties, and external disturbances. Results from numerical experiments, performed in a platform based on the Gazebo simulator and on a Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the system, are presented to corroborate the performance of the zonotopic state estimator along with the designed controller.

"Random vibrations in unmanned aerial vehicles, mathematical analysis and control methodology based on expectation and probability","The analysis of the random vibrations that occur during the flight of the unmanned aerial vehicles is important, as these random vibrations have random characteristic properties and have the ability to decrease the endurance of such systems. The accuracy of data collected from sensors in the unmanned aerial vehicle system is important for the flight control system. The transferring of these data among different sensors such as inertial measurement unit, axis accelerometers, GPS or cameras is usually affected by many factors. One of the important factors is the random vibration, which is usually caused by aerodynamic excitation or air turbulence. The problem of random vibrations has been studied for a long time and explained in many text books. In this study, the author introduces a mathematical analysis for random vibrations that are independent of their sources by considering these vibrations as a random and non-stationary process and designs a control methodology based on expectations and probability theory to reduce the effect of these vibrations. The analysis used in this research is based on the assumptions of practical approximation techniques.",Drone,2019
Sea-unammned aerial vehicle takeoff characteristics analysis method based on approximate equilibrium hypothesis,"In this paper, transient multiphase flow computational fluid dynamics simulations based on volume of fluid model are conducted for a sea-unmanned aerial vehicle. The approximate equilibrium hypothesis is implemented after estimating the acceleration in the vertical direction. The complete configuration model and hull model are employed in simulation to predict the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces separately for different demands of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic computational fluid dynamics predictions and computing efficiency. In takeoff characteristics analysis, the computational fluid dynamics simulations are conducted as inputs for piecewise interpolation method. The calculated results show that the sea-unmanned aerial vehicle takeoff characteristics are totally different from a conventional aircraft. The drag-peak at hump speed is the obvious feature of the sea-unmanned aerial vehicle/seaplane. In most cases, if a sea-unmanned aerial vehicle will takeoff successfully as long as it can pass the drag peak. The takeoff distance and time calculated by piecewise interpolation method match the experimental data within 7% deviation. The accuracy is acceptable for conceptual design stage of a sea-unmanned aerial vehicle/seaplane. The results are applicable to consultation in choosing takeoff field or choosing powerplant.",Drone,2019
Energy-aware path planning of an unmanned aerial vehicle acting as a communication relay for mobile ground nodes,"We focus on energy-aware path planning of a small unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay which forwards the data received from a stationary remote station to a mobile access point. In order to reduce the communication power required for reliable communication between the unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay and access point, the unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay keeps track of the access point within a maximum allowable horizontal distance at a constant altitude, and thus the communication power of the unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay decreases as the horizontal distance decreases. In order to determine the energy-efficient manoeuvring of the unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay within the horizontal distance, we formulate a new off-line trajectory optimization problem. The solution of the problem gives insight into how to realize the energy-efficient manoeuvring. For online implementation of energy-efficient path planning (manoeuvring control), we propose two control schemes: a model predictive control scheme and a standoff tracking control scheme. These schemes can significantly reduce manoeuvring energy compared with conventional schemes.",Drone,2019
Robust attitude fault-tolerant control for unmanned autonomous helicopter with flapping dynamics and actuator faults,"In this paper, an adaptive robust fault-tolerant control scheme is developed for attitude tracking control of a medium-scale unmanned autonomous helicopter with rotor flapping dynamics, external unknown disturbances and actuator faults. For the convenience of control design, the actuator dynamics with respect to the tail rotor are introduced. The adaptive fault observer and robust item are employed to observe the actuator faults and eliminate the effect of external disturbances, respectively. A backstepping-based robust fault-tolerant control scheme is designed with the aim of obtaining satisfactory tracking performance and closed-loop system stability is proved via Lyapunov analysis, which guarantees the convergence of all closed-loop system signals. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",Drone,2019

Sustainable and secure trajectories for the military Internet of Drones (IoD) through an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol,"Internet of Drones (IoD) involves cooperation and policing amongst Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based on waypoints generated through a series of algorithms. The dynamic reconfigurability of conveyances in Ion demands a secure trajectory and channel accessibility which is procurable through an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The majority of existing works considers the security of UAV-trajectories as a part of cryptographic and channel accessibility only, whereas the proposed approach idealizes link stability as one of the essential components for attaining secure trajectories. Furthermore, this paper proposes a deep neural network-based security framework, which embeds an efficient MAC protocol controlled by Macaulay's duration. The proposed approach fortifies that an extensive control over links provides an adequate duration for enhancing the security aspects of IoD and launching countermeasures against any known cyber attacks.

Consensus evaluation method of multi-ground-target threat for unmanned aerial vehicle swarm based on heterogeneous group decision making,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm cooperative combat decision making is the core of swarm cooperative engagement. Due to the distributed architecture, each unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a threat evaluation of multi-ground-target in the early stages of saturation attack, so a consensus evaluation is required to avoid the subsequent nonconsensual combat decision making. Considering the uncertainty of information in battlefield environment, this study proposes a consensus evaluation method of multi-ground-target threat for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm based on heterogeneous group decision making (GDM). Compared to the traditional methods of multi-target threat evaluation, the proposed method is a dynamic evaluation process, can directly deal with heterogeneous information without information loss, aggregate information with the consideration of the relevance of heterogeneous information and realize the consensus of evaluation results based on feedback mechanism. The reasonability and effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by simulation experiments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Thermodynamic analysis of a solid oxide fuel cell jet hybrid engine for long-endurance unmanned air vehicles,"The turbine-less jet engine is promising due to the compressor driven by a motor and the high combustor exit temperature. It is a key problem that how to provide electric power for the motor. In this paper, a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) jet hybrid engine with anode and cathode recirculation is proposed and investigated where the SOFC power system is instead of the turbine to provide power for the compressor. For the system, compressed air entering into SOFC cathode channel is preheated by cathode recirculation exhaust. The gases reform in the reformer, which are air, fuel and steam from the anode recirculation exhaust. Reformed gases are provided for the SOFC anode channel. SOFC produces electric power to drive the compressor by a motor. Then, SOFC exhaust enters the combustor. The combustor exhaust expands and produces propulsion power in the nozzle. In order to evaluate and improve the performance of the SOFC jet hybrid engine, the thermodynamic analysis model is built. The energy and exergy analysis are accomplished. The effect of pressure ratio and flight altitude on the performance of the hybrid engine are studied. In addition, sensitivity analysis is accomplished. The preliminary results are as follows: (1) The thermal efficiency, the specific thrust and the specific impulse of the engine could reach to 57.60%, 790.00 N/(kg.s(-1)) and 4132 s under design conditions. (2) The sum of the relative exergy destruction ratio of the SOFC, the combustor, the nozzle and the exhaust is over 85%. (3) The total pressure recovery coefficient of the SOFC has a strong influence on the performance of the SOFC jet hybrid engine.",Drone,2019
Design of a fault detection and diagnose system for intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle navigation system,"A secure control system is of great importance for unmanned aerial vehicles, especially in the condition of fault data injection. As the source of the feedback control system, the Inertial navigation system/Global position system (INS/GPS) is the premise of flight control system security. However, unmanned aerial vehicles have the requirement of lightweight and low cost for airborne equipment, which makes redundant device object unrealistic. Therefore, the method of fault detection and diagnosis is desperately needed. In this paper, a fault detection and diagnosis method based on fuzzy system and neural network is proposed. Fuzzy system does not depend on the mathematical model of the process, which overcomes the difficulties in obtaining the accurate model of unmanned aerial vehicles. Neural network has a strong self-learning ability, which could be used to optimize the membership function of fuzzy system. This paper is structured as follows: first, a Kalman filter observer is introduced to calculate the residual sequences caused by different sensor faults. Then, the sequences are transmitted to the fault detection and diagnosis system and fault type can be obtained. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm was implemented and evaluated with real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect the sensor faults successfully with high levels of accuracy and efficiency.",Drone,2019
Unknown ground moving target tracking using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles,"This paper investigates the problem of robust guidance law design for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles to achieve desired formation pattern for standoff tracking of an unknown ground moving target. The proposed guidance law consists of two main parts: relative range regulation and space angle control. For the first mission, a novel control law is proposed to regulate the relative distance between the unmanned aerial vehicle and the ground moving target to zero asymptotically based on adaptive sliding mode control approach. Considering the discontinuous property of the sign function, which is often used in traditional sliding mode control and will result in high-frequency chattering in the control channel, the proposed controller adopts the continuous saturation function for chattering elimination. Besides the continuous property, convergence to the origin asymptotically can be guaranteed theoretically with the proposed controller, which is quite different from traditional boundary layer technique, where only bounded motion around the sliding manifold can be ensured. For asymptotic stability, it is only required that the lumped uncertainty is bounded, but the upper bound may be unknown by virtue of the designed adaptive methodology. For space angle control, a new multiple leader-follower information architecture is introduced and an acceleration command is then derived for each unmanned aerial vehicle to space them about the loiter circle defined by the first controller. Simulation results with different conditions clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed formulation.",Drone,2019

Desired compensation RISE-based IBVS control of quadrotors for tracking a moving target,"To achieve accurate moving target tracking in the presence of multiple disturbances, this paper presents a desired compensation robust integral of the sign of the error (DCRISE) feedback control strategy for quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles under image-based visual servo (IBVS) framework. For the purpose of effectively regulating the pose and attitude of quadrotor, proper perspective image moments extracted from the defined virtual image plane are chosen as the image features. Then, a DCRISE feedback controller is constructed for the quadrotor, in which a robust integral of the sign of the error method is employed for suppressing the multiple disturbances and a desired compensation-based feedforward control is introduced to address the nonlinearity nature of the system and circumvent the requirements on the availability of linear velocity. It is theoretically proved by the Lyapunov analysis that all the closed-loop tracking errors under the proposed DCRISE-based IBVS control structure are convergent to a small neighborhood around the origin in spite of multiple disturbances. The validity and advantages of the present approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and comparisons.",Drone,2019
Application of NDT thermographic imaging of aerospace structures,"This work aims to address the effectiveness and challenges of Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) inspection and improve the detection of defects without causing damage to the material or operator. It focuses on two types of NDT methods; pulsed thermography and vibrothermography. The paper also explores the possibility of performing automated aerial inspection using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provided with a thermographic imaging system. The concept of active thermography is discussed for inspecting aircraft CFRP panels along with the proposal for performing aerial inspection using the UAV for real time inspection. Static NDT results and the further UAV research indicate that the UAV inspection approach could significantly reduce the inspection time, cost, and workload, whilst potentially increasing the probability of detection.",Drone,2019
Shape Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis of a Morphing-Wing Aircraft,"Morphing-wing concepts have received growing interests in the recent years for enhancing the multi-mission performance of unmanned aerial vehicle. However, to obtain a feasible morphing strategy, the optimization design studies are required. In this paper, an aerodynamic optimization study for a morphing-wing aircraft with variable sweep, span, and chord length was conducted to obtain the optimum configurations at subsonic, transonic and supersonic conditions. The optimization objective is to obtain maximum lift-to-drag ratios subject to lift coefficients and static stability constraints at each flight condition. A genetic algorithm in conjunction with surrogate models was employed to search optimum solutions in the entire design space. The aerodynamic forces are calculated by an Euler-based solver and friction drag estimation code. The optimum configuration corresponding to any flight condition can be determined through the optimization. A global sensitivity analysis based on the surrogate model was also carried out, hence the contribution of each design variable to the optimization objective can be analyzed. The results indicated that the optimum wing at subsonic speeds have a lower sweep angle and high aspect ratio, and the wing sweep has a primary contribution to lift-to-drag ratios, and the span is secondary; at transonic conditions, the medium-sweep wing is the optimum, and the contribution of the span is far more than other variables; at supersonic conditions, the optimum configuration becomes a high-sweep cropped delta wing, and the span has a dominant contribution, and the sweep is secondary.",Drone,2019
Recurrently exploring class-wise attention in a hybrid convolutional and bidirectional LSTM network for multi-label aerial image classification,"Aerial image classification is of great significance in the remote sensing community, and many researches have been conducted over the past few years. Among these studies, most of them focus on categorizing an image into one semantic label, while in the real world, an aerial image is often associated with multiple labels, e.g., multiple object-level labels in our case. Besides, a comprehensive picture of present objects in a given high-resolution aerial image can provide a more in-depth understanding of the studied region. For these reasons, aerial image multi-label classification has been attracting increasing attention. However, one common limitation shared by existing methods in the community is that the co-occurrence relationship of various classes, so-called class dependency, is underexplored and leads to an inconsiderate decision. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to end network, namely class-wise attention-based convolutional and bidirectional LSTM network (CA-Cony-BiLSTM), for this task. The proposed network consists of three indispensable components: (1) a feature extraction module, (2) a class attention learning layer, and (3) a bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network. Particularly, the feature extraction module is designed for extracting fine-grained semantic feature maps, while the class attention learning layer aims at capturing discriminative class-specific features. As the most important part, the bidirectional LSTM-based sub-network models the underlying class dependency in both directions and produce structured multiple object labels. Experimental results on UCM multi-label dataset and DFC15 multi label dataset validate the effectiveness of our model quantitatively and qualitatively.",Drone,2019
Morphing wing with compliant aileron and slat for unmanned aerial vehicles,"Aircraft perform flight in multiple regimes with different speeds, Angles of Attack (AoA), sideslip angles, and at different altitudes. Designers usually choose the airfoil having the best performance for the cruise mode only or being able to stay suboptimal for all the flight regimes. It leads to a reduction in the maximum lift-to-drag ratio for certain regimes, as well as deterioration in the overall performance. That is why the adaptive wing with its ability to stay optimal for any of the flight regimes is a promising technology which could significantly improve the performance and maneuverability of the aircraft during the flight. In this work, we assess the performance of the wing with the traditional and adaptive mechanization of the flap and slat using computer simulation followed by the experiments in the wind tunnel environment. This work also provides the design of an adaptive wing with an adaptive flap and slat. All the investigations were performed for the two-dimensional airfoil under different Reynolds numbers and AoA. This paper demonstrates that an adaptive wing improves the lift-to-drag ratio and maneuverability of the aircraft for different flight regimes. The application of the adaptive wing mechanization could improve the lift-to-drag ratio by 20%-30% for certain regimes, thereby improving the range and time of operation.

Flight Time Estimation for Continuous Surveillance Missions Using a Multirotor UAV,"To achieve the continuous surveillance capable multirotor type solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), we develop the photovoltaic power management system (PPMS) which manages power from photovoltaic (PV) modules and a battery pack to support the power of the UAV. To estimate the possible flight time of the UAV, we use the concept of state of charge (SOC) estimation based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and complementary filter (CF) and then calculate the possible flight time by using the slope of the SOC graph during hovering flight mode. According to the results, estimated flight time increases up to 54.14 min at 11:00 a.m. and decreases down to 6.70 min at 18:00 p.m.",Drone,2019
Effect of Valve Timing and Excess Air Ratio on Torque in Hydrogen-Fueled Internal Combustion Engine for UAV,"In this study, in order to convert a 2.4 L reciprocating gasoline engine into a hydrogen engine an experimental device for supplying hydrogen fuel was installed. Additionally, an injector that is capable of supplying the hydrogen fuel was installed. The basic combustion characteristics, including torque, were investigated by driving the engine with a universal engine control unit. To achieve stable combustion and maximize output, the intake and exhaust valve opening times were changed and the excess air ratio of the mixture was controlled. The changes in the torque, excess air ratio, hydrogen fuel, and intake airflow rate, were compared under low engine speed and high load (wide open throttle) operating conditions without throttling. As the intake valve opening time advanced at a certain excess air ratio, the intake air amount and torque increased. When the opening time of the exhaust valve was retarded, the intake airflow rate and torque decreased. The torque and thermal efficiency decreased when the opening time of the intake and exhaust valve advanced excessively. The change of the mixture condition's excess air ratio did not influence the tendency of the torque variation when the exhaust valve opening time and torque increased, and when the mixture became richer and the intake valve opening time was fixed. Under a condition that was more retarded than the 332 CAD condition, the torque decreased by about 2 Nm with the 5 CAD of intake valve opening time retards. The maximum torque of 138.1 Nm was obtained at an optimized intake and the exhaust valve opening time was 327 crank angle degree (CAD) and 161 CAD, respectively, when the excess air ratio was 1.14 and the backfire was suppressed. Backfire occurred because of the temperature increase in the combustion chamber rather than because of the change in the fuel distribution under the rich mixture condition, where the other combustion control factors were constantly fixed from a three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code simulation.",Drone,2019
Insulator detection and recognition of explosion based on convolutional neural networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with high definition (HD) cameras can obtain a large number of detailed inspection images. The insulator is an indispensable component in the transmission lines. Detecting insulator in image video quickly and accurately can provide a reliable basis for the ranging and the obstacle avoidance flight of UAV close to the tower and transmission line. At the same time, the insulator is a serious threat to the safety of the power grid due to the multiple faults of the insulator, and the computer technology should be fully utilized to diagnose the fault. Detection of the insulator images with the complex aerial background is implemented by constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN), which has the classic architecture of five modules of convolution and pooling, two modules of fully connected layers. In this paper, we propose a recognition algorithm for explosion fault based on saliency detection, which uses the trained network model to extract the features. Then, we put the saliency maps into a self-organizing feature map (SOM) network and build the mathematical module via super pixel segmentation, contour detection and other image processing methods. The test shows that the algorithm can reduce the error that may be caused by manual analysis. It also demonstrates that the detection of the insulator and the recognition of explosion fault can effectively improve the efficiency and intelligence level.",Drone,2019
Challenges and Best Practices for Deriving Temperature Data from an Uncalibrated UAV Thermal Infrared Camera,"Miniaturized thermal infrared (TIR) cameras that measure surface temperature are increasingly available for use with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, deriving accurate temperature data from these cameras is non-trivialsince they are highly sensitive to changes in their internal temperature and low-cost models are often not radiometrically calibrated. We present the results of laboratory and field experiments that tested the extent of the temperature-dependency of a non-radiometric FLIR Vue Pro 640. We found that a simple empirical line calibration using at least three ground calibration points was sufficient to convert camera digital numbers to temperature values for images captured during UAV flight. Although the camera performed well under stable laboratory conditions (accuracy +/- 0.5 degrees C), the accuracy declined to +/- 5 degrees C under the changing ambient conditions experienced during UAV flight. The poor performance resulted from the non-linear relationship between camera output and sensor temperature, which was affected by wind and temperature-drift during flight. The camera's automated non-uniformity correction (NUC) could not sufficiently correct for these effects. Prominent vignetting was also visible in images captured under both stable and changing ambient conditions. The inconsistencies in camera output over time and across the sensor will affect camera applications based on relative temperature differences as well as user-generated radiometric calibration. Based on our findings, we present a set of best practices for UAV TIR camera sampling to minimize the impacts of the temperature dependency of these systems.",Drone,2019
Eavesdropping and Jamming Selection Policy for Suspicious UAVs Based on Low Power Consumption over Fading Channels,"Traditional wireless security focuses on preventing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications from suspicious eavesdropping and/or jamming attacks. However, there is a growing need for governments to keep malicious UAV communications under legitimate surveillance. This paper first investigates a new surveillance paradigm for monitoring suspicious UAV communications via jamming suspicious UAVs. Due to the power consumption limitation, the choice of eavesdropping and jamming will reflect the performance of the UAVs communication. Therefore, the paper analyses the UAV's eavesdropping and jamming models in different cases, and then proposes the model to optimize the data package in the constraints of lower power consumption, which can be solved by the proposed selection policy. The simulation results validate our proposed selection policy in terms of power consumption and eavesdropped packets. In different fading models, power consumption increases with time, regardless of distances, and our proposed policy performs better in Weibull fading channels in terms of eavesdropped packets.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Navigation of UAVs in Large-Scale Complex Environments: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method that allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to execute navigation tasks in large-scale complex environments. This technique is important for many applications such as goods delivery and remote surveillance. The problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and solved by a novel online DRL algorithm designed based on two strictly proved policy gradient theorems within the actor-critic framework. In contrast to conventional simultaneous localization and mapping-based or sensing and avoidance-based approaches, our method directly maps UAVs' raw sensory measurements into control signals for navigation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can enable UAVs to autonomously perform navigation in a virtual large-scale complex environment and can be generalized to more complex, larger-scale, and three-dimensional environments. Besides, the proposed online DRL algorithm addressing POMDPs outperforms the state-of-the-art.",Drone,2019
Energy Efficient Legitimate Wireless Surveillance of UAV Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enhance connectivity and accessibility for civilian and military applications. Criminals or terrorists can potentially use UAVs for committing crimes and terrorism, thus endangering public safety. In this paper, we consider that a legitimate UAV is employed to track flight of suspicious UAVs for preventing safety and security threats. To obtain flight information of the suspicious UAVs, the legitimate UAV intentionally jams the suspicious receiver so as to force the suspicious UAV to reduce its data rate, and hence increase the eavesdropping success. An energy-efficient jamming strategy is proposed for the legitimate UAV to maximize the amount of eavesdropped packets. Moreover, a tracking algorithm is developed for the legitimate UAV to track the suspicious flight by comprehensively utilizing eavesdropped packets, angle-of-arrival and received signal strength of the suspicious transmitter's signal. A new simulation framework is implemented to combine the complementary features of optimization toolbox with channel modeling (in MATLAB) and discrete event-driven mobility tracking (in NS3). Moreover, numerical results validate the proposed algorithms in terms of packet eavesdropping rate and tracking accuracy of the suspicious UAVs' trajectory.",Drone,2019
Modelling the effects of fundamental UAV flight parameters on LiDAR point clouds to facilitate objectives-based planning,"Utilised globally across a wide range of applications, the ability to assess and understand LiDAR system capabilities represents an essential component in developing informed decisions on instrument selection and the logistical planning processes associated with site-specific limitations, project objectives and UAV operations. This study employed the new SLAM-based CSIRO ""Hovermap"" LiDAR system within a purpose-built environment as a testbed to experimentally investigate the interactive effects of fundamental UAV flight parameters on key metrics of LiDAR point clouds. Assessed within a full factorial design at both Site- and Target-levels, the UAV input variables of Pattern, ground Speed and above ground Altitude (AGL) were tested against the point cloud response variables Density, GSD and Accuracy as measured by RMSE and cloud-to-mesh Euclidian distance ('Deviation'). A novel approach is described wherein the trajectory file of each flight was examined to determine the observed values of the input and response variables, remove noise and facilitate a standardised basis of comparison. Several new terms are introduced including Sampling Effort Variable (SEV, s.m(-2)), Effective Scan Rate (ESR, pts.s(-1)) and Effective Density Rate (EDR, pts.m(-2).s(-1)) as well as an alternate approach to describe Pattern (s.m(-1)) as a scalar quantity. Reporting significant effects with all response variables at both Site- and Target-levels, the Range of the LiDAR sensor, closely associated with Altitude, presented as the single most important factor. Interestingly, the combination of the independent variables as SEV and EDRpred ('predicted' EDR) showed the highest coefficient of determination in the Site-level prediction of Density (R-Adj(2) = 0.894) and GSD (R-Adj(2) = 0.978,), respectively, whilst Range best correlated with observed RMSE (R-Adj(2) = 0.948) and Deviation (R-Adj(2) = 0.963). Predictive models returned mixed results when evaluated at the Target-level and highlights the need for further investigation to achieve the maximum benefit of high-resolution UAV LiDAR. The results presented here confirm that the CSIRO Hovermap performance is robust and, although variable depending on UAV flight parameters, is predictable and demonstrates the potential value in understanding system performance in harmonised flight planning to achieve project-specific objectives.",Drone,2019
Radiometric calibration assessments for UAS-borne multispectral cameras: Laboratory and field protocols,"The main objective of this study was to develop and test a framework that can be used by Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) operators with varying technical backgrounds to estimate the accuracy and reliability of multispectral (visible and Near-Infrared or NIR) sensor measurements. We evaluated the performance of two multispectral sensors the MicaSense RedEdge and the Airinov MultiSpec 4C - in both a laboratory and field setting. In the laboratory, we measured the reflectance of a number of reference target materials using each UAS sensor, and compared the values to those measured using a calibrated spectrometer. We found a strong linear relationship between the measurements made by the MicaSense RedEdge and the spectrometer, while the relationship was much weaker for the Airinov MultiSpec 4C, particularly in the longer wavelength bands (red-edge and NIR). A sub-set of the target materials were selected as ground reference targets for three field calibration exercises. In field calibration assessment No. 1, imagery was collected using each UAS sensor and reflectance values were extracted from pixels covering the ground reference targets. The extracted values were compared to the reflectance values acquired in the laboratory, and both UAS sensors were found to over-estimate reflectance, with lower accuracy in red-edge and NIR bands. Field calibration assessment No. 2 involved a calculation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values at field control points using both UAS sensors, and we found a strong linear relationship between the NDVI values and measurements made by a hand-held NDVI sensor, suggesting that the calculation of a normalized band ratio (i.e., NDVI) effectively reduces the reflectance measurement inaccuracy that we observed previously. Field calibration assessment No. 3 included image acquisition of ground reference targets using the MicaSense RedEdge sensor over seventeen sequential field surveys. Results revealed measurement variability over time, suggesting that daily differences in solar illumination and atmospheric conditions may influence derived reflectance values. In light of these results, we propose simplified procedures that can be adopted by UAS operators to periodically assess the radiometric fidelity of their multispectral sensors.",Drone,2019
Automated mobilities: From weaponized drones to killer bots,"The article develops the conjecture that automated mobilities are particularly characteristic of the digital era. Acknowledging that the development of the mobilities paradigm has been especially fruitful for the social sciences, the article contends that the advent of artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and accelerating automation makes new conceptual and methodological demands on mobilities research.

In the final section, I turn to analyse one particular instance of automated mobilities: namely, AI military technology and weapons systems. I conclude by setting out some conjectures on the relations between AI, automated mobilities and the paradigm of mobilities.",Drone,2019
Systemic design of distributed multi-UAV cooperative decision-making for multi-target tracking,"In this paper, we consider the cooperative decision-making problem for multi-target tracking in multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. The multi-UAV decision-making problem is modeled in the framework of distributed multi-agent partially observable Markov decision processes (MPOMDPs). Specifically, the state of the targets is represented by the joint multi-target probability distribution (JMTPD), which is estimated by a distributed information fusion strategy. In the information fusion process, the most accurate estimation is selected to propagate through the whole network in finite time. We propose a max-consensus protocol to guarantee the consistency of the JMTPD. It is proven that the max-consensus can be achieved in the connected communication graph after a limited number of iterations. Based on the consistent JMTPD, the distributed partially observable Markov decision algorithm is used to make tracking decisions. The proposed method uses the Fisher information to bid for targets in a distributed auction. The bid is based upon the reward value of the individual UAV's POMDPs, thereby removing the need to optimize the global reward in the MPOMDPs. Finally, the cooperative decision-making approach is deployed in a simulation of a multi-target tracking problem. We compare our proposed algorithm with the centralized method and the greedy approach. The simulation results show that the proposed distributed method has a similar performance to the centralized method, and outperforms the greedy approach.",Drone,2019

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the same performance as the exhaustive search method, and significantly outperforms the existing algorithms.",Drone,2019
"Development of Multitarget Acquisition, Pointing, and Tracking System for Airborne Laser Communication","Cluster unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely demanded. To achieve high rate and large capacity communication with cluster UAVs, one of the key but still challenge task is to perform multitarget acquisition, pointing, and tracking (APT) under complex airborne environment. To solve this problem, this paper gives one composite axis APT system for multitarget laser communication with cluster UAVs. The APT system consists of a gimbal mirror and piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (FSMs), which can achieve independent and synchronous control of multiple optical axes. The cascade control scheme is designed for the gimbal mirror and the H infinity controller is designed for the FSM. To further improve the control accuracy, the hysteresis compensator based on least square support vector machines (LS-SVM) is proposed. The pruning error minimization method of LS-SVM is applied to reduce the computational cost. The simulation studies validate the control performance of the multitarget APT system.

Leakage Mitigation in Heterodyne FMCW Radar for Small Drone Detection With Stationary Point Concentration Technique,"To prevent potential hazards posed by fast-evolving drones, it is of importance to develop a radar system for drone detection. Frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars are widely used for that purpose. Heterodyne architectures are preferred for them to mitigate dc offset errors. Having said that, FMCW radars suffer from permanent leakage from the transmitter into the receiver. The leakage phase noise raises the total noise floor and limits the radar sensitivity. Here, we propose a stationary point concentration (SPC) technique in order to overcome the challenges. The SPC technique concentrates the leakage phase noise on a stationary point to alleviate the impact of the noise. The technique can be realized using digital signal processing without additional hardware. The results show that the proposed technique significantly lowers the noise floor.",Drone,2019
A Modified FOPID Versus H and mu Synthesis Controllers: Robustness Study,"The H, mu synthesis and fractional order (FPM) controllers are types of robust designs that use the linearized model of the system and provide a linear controller. The mu synthesis approach directly considers the uncertainty, but H and FOPID run for the worst uncertainty scenario. mFPM is the modified version of FOPID design where 1) it takes into account the given uncertainty by a graphical Phase Margin Distribution Map (PMDP), and 2) reduces the controller design calculations by working on the samples of the system frequency response instead of its analytical equation. The design strategy can perfectly force the desired flatness in the phase margin band and maintain the system performance robustness. For evaluation, the algorithms are applied to a second-order uncertain system and a perturbed UAV roll control. In both cases, the lowest output response variance and the best performance robustness is gained from the mFPM design. This is verified through numerous simulations.",Drone,2019
Hidden Security: EU Public Research Funds and the Development of European Drones,"In recent years, dozens of drone development projects have attracted hundreds of millions of euros from EU public research funds with little accountability and scarce political oversight. This article relates the ongoing exponential growth of the drone industry in Europe with the vast amounts of EU public research funding channelled to drone research. These projects typically configure partnerships that are neither strictly public, nor strictly private, and it is precisely a combination of their hybrid nature with the centrality of technologial expertise that makes them less visible. This partial invisibility is particularly relevant in the context of a dual-use technology that enables new forms of surveillance, poses societal challenges, and can be used as a lethal weapon. Beyond providing short-term responses to specific problems, we argue that these tactics are largely aimed at fostering a common EU security and defence research & development culture in a time of international security uncertainty.",Drone,2019
Geometric Filtering of Matches Between Points in Bands of Hyperspectral Cubes,"Hyperspectral images can present low contrast, noisy pixels, and illumination variation among bands, which complicates the extraction of interest points and reduces the number of reliable image matches affecting subsequent tasks as band registration and bundle adjustment. Once matched points have been determined, a technique to select correct matches in sets with outliers is required, as well as to fix mismatches. In this letter, we apply a filtering technique that uses a majority voting algorithm combined with a 2-D Helmert geometric transformation to identify consistent matches. The correct matches also allow the estimation of parameters of a geometric transformation, which enables point transfer between images. Thus, mismatches can be fixed to their correct positions. Experiments were performed with the proposed technique using hyperspectral images that were collected with a lightweight camera using the time-sequential principle, while onboard an unmanned aerial vehicle. Scale-invariant feature transform was used for both keypoint extraction and image matching. Reliable matches were extracted from the sets with outliers, and incorrect matches were fixed. The results of the technique were compared with an algorithm based on random sample consensus. In the comparison, the proposed technique was efficient in extracting a larger number of correct matches. In addition, 85% of the incorrect matches were recovered, which significantly increased the density of matched pairs.",Drone,2019
Adaptive MPC Using a Dual Fast Orthogonal Kalman Filter: Application to Quadcopter Altitude Control,"This paper presents a novel application of recursive fast orthogonal search (R-FOS) to produce a time-varying linear state-space system model based on a historical record of input and outputs. Themodel is integrated into a larger unmanned aerial system to control the altitude of a quadcopter using adaptive model predictive control (MPC). Similar to a dual Kalman filter (KF), R-FOS is also used in conjunction with a KF observer in the form of a dual fast orthogonal Kalman filter to estimate the system states. Four variations of R-FOS are implemented and compared in terms of mean squared error during a number of simulations. The R-FOS adaptiveMPC strategy provides better altitude control when executed online than when an offline model is used. Comparable performance is achieved with fewer model terms when the FOS criteria for evaluation of additional terms is considered. Finally, the performance is significantly improved when a forgetting factor is incorporated to give greater weight to more recent observations. These findings demonstrate that by combining R-FOS with adaptive MPC, one can optimally control a system with unknown, time-varying dynamics.",Drone,2019

"Combat and operational risk factors for post-traumatic stress disorder symptom criteria among United States air force remotely piloted aircraft tor ""Drone"" warfighters","The prevalence and expression of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among United States Air Force remotely piloted aircraft (RPA; commonly referred to as ""drones"") warfighters exposed to battlefield trauma via remote, electronic warfare is relevant and critical to the effective delivery of mental health care for this population. RPA warfighters (n = 715) with real-time exposure to at least one traumatic event participated in an online survey. Measures included the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and survey of exposure to traumatic events during the course of operational combat missions. A total of 6.15% met PTSD symptom criteria; those in the age ranges of 31-35 and 36-40 and those working 51 or more hours per week had greater odds of meeting symptom criteria. For combat-related events, the number of events in which RPA warfighters witnessed civilian bystanders being killed by enemy forces or felt shared responsibility for the injury or death of bystanders were also significant predictors, regardless of whether the risk was anticipated or unanticipated. The results of this study suggest that specific types of exposure and participation in missions with specific outcomes, albeit via electronic, remote means, are associated with an increased risk for meeting PTSD symptom criteria.",Drone,2019
Polarization Diversity Technology Research in Passive Radar Based on Subcarrier Processing,"The work in this paper is divided into two parts. The first part is going to investigate the potential benefits of clutter suppression in a polarization filtering technology. The performance of a conventional polarization filter is limited by the complex electromagnetic environment. The subcarrier-based polarization filter (SC-PF) enhances the robustness to the environmental disturbance. The experiment results show that the SC-PF has a better clutter suppression performance compared with a conventional polarization filter. The average signal-to-noise ratio increases about 5 dB in airplane detection and about 8 dB in drone detection. The other part is the preliminary analysis of target polarization characteristics. With the extraction of the polarization amplitude ratio (PAR) of the airplane and drone, the PAR characteristic of airplane fluctuates dramatically and the PAR characteristic of drone fluctuates relatively smooth. Therefore, the difference of PAR characteristics of different targets may be helpful in target classification and recognition.",Drone,2019
An Evaluation of Reflectance Calibration Methods for UAV Spectral Imagery,"Spectral imagery using micro-unmanned aerial vehicles is rapidly advancing. This study compared reflectance calibration methods for imagery acquired using the Parrot Sequoia imager, a commercial multispectral sensor package. For the study, two orthomosaics were calibrated using 1) a manufacturer-suggested AIRINOV standard correction using PIX4D software and 2) the Empirical Line Calibration (ELC) method using ground radiometric data on specific in-scene targets. Both scenes were analyzed for target spectral agreement by ground radiometric survey. Regression analysis demonstrated more favorable target correlation for the ELC imagery than the AIRINOV-calibrated imagery, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) analysis supporting these results. Finally, classification maps were produced between the data sets. Error analysis resulted in an overall accuracy of 24% for the AIRINOV map compared to ELC-based truth data, with a considerable number of pixels associated with brighter targets unclassified. These results demonstrate the need for standardized calibration procedures in the spectral correction of small-format remote sensor data.",Drone,2019
3D real-time path planning based on cognitive behavior optimization algorithm for UAV with TLP model,"Real-time path planning of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the three-dimension environment is a complicated global optimum problem. This paper formulates the real-time path planning problem for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a complicated global optimum problem in the three-dimensional environment and proposes an improved a tree-dimensional (3D) real-time path planning algorithm based on tri-level programing model to generate an optimal feasible route. The flight routeis designed to have a short length and a low flight altitude. The multiple constraints based on the realistic scenarios are taken into account as the threat level function. Firstly, from the view of control performance of UAV, tri-level programing (TLP) model is designed to generate a smooth path. Then, the objective functions including the leader, middle-level follower and bottom-level follower function and decision variables of TLP are defined to guarantee the flight toward the target. In addition, the cognitive behavior optimization algorithm (COA) embedded with the proposed optimization strategies is used to solve this problem. Numerical experimental results and the comparison with PSO, RRT algorithm demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Drone,2019

Impact paint sensor based on polymer/multi-dimension carbon nano isotopes composites,"We presented a novel impact paint sensor made of piezoresistive nano-carbon composites and studied its characteristics. The paint sensors were fabricated with multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), exfoliated graphite nano-platelets (xGnP), and a hybrid type of the two nano-carbon fillers and were sprayed onto a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic panel for lab testing. In ball drop impact test, the MWCNT-xGnP-based hybrid sensor showed the best characteristics in impact energy sensing within the range 0.07-1.0 J. We also studied the piezoresistive mechanism due to dimensional variations of nano carbon isotopes for sensor design. Piezorestivity of nano-carbon sensor was significantly dominated the electrical contact variation of the electrical fillers in a matrix. This study is expected to provide a feasibility test for designing impact paint sensors with optimized sensitivity for a composite structural health monitoring.",Drone,2019
Airframe noise measurements in a large hard-walled closed-section wind tunnel,"The airframe noise of a 1:2 scaled aircraft model is investigated through a series of experiments in the hard walled closed test section of a large non-anechoic wind tunnel. A surface mounted phased microphone array is used to acquire the wall pressure fluctuations generated by the interaction of the wind tunnel flow and the propagating noise. Data from two measurement campaigns are analysed. The wind tunnel acoustic behaviour and the array performance are first assessed evaluating the results obtained from a reference sound source installed in the centre of the test section. The combination of different airflow speeds, array positions and sound sources are tested. The airframe noise is evaluated acquiring pressure fluctuations in different configurations. The main parameters varied during the tests are the flight configuration, the speed of the airflow, the incidence angle of the model and the position of the microphone array. Data are processed and then analysed in the frequency domain and using a conventional beamforming algorithm to retrieve the sound source maps over the regions of interest. Source maps are deconvolved with a CLEAN-SC routine and single source contributions determined through integration of auto-powers. The resulting spectra are finally scaled determining the exponents of the pertinent scaling laws. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Power Allocation and Mode Selection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Relay Based Wireless Networks,"Many unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications have been employed for performing data collection in facilitating tasks such as surveillance and monitoring objectives in remote and dangerous environments. In light of the fact that most of the existing UAV relaying applications operate in conventional half-duplex (HD) mode, a full-duplex (FD) based UAV relay aided wireless network is investigated, in which the UAV relay helps forwarding information from the source (S) node to the destination (D) . Since the activated UAV relays are always floating and flying in the air, its channel state information (CSI) as well as channel capacity is a time-variant parameter. Considering decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocol in UAV relays, the cooperative relaying channel capacity is constrained by the relatively weaker one (i.e. in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)) between S-to-relay and relay-to-D links. The channel capacity can be optimized by adaptively optimizing the transmit power of S and/or UAV relay. Furthermore, a hybrid HD/FD mode is enabled in the proposed UAV relays for adaptively optimizing the channel utilization subject to the instantaneous CSI and/or remaining self-interference (SI) levels. Numerical results show that the channel capacity of the proposed UAV relay aided wireless networks can be maximized by adaptively responding to the influence of various real-time factors.",Drone,2019
Affine formation control for heterogeneous multi-agent systems with directed interaction networks,"In this paper, affine formation control problems of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with linear dynamics are studied. As a novel method, the affine formation control has the ability to handle various movement constraints based on the affine transformation. A proportional-integral (PI)-type control scheme is proposed to ensure the effective affine formation control of the leader-following group with directed interaction graphs and successfully eliminate the steady-state errors. Sufficient conditions for the selection of control parameters are given and proved. Considering that the followers are subjected to the external bounded time-varying disturbances, the designed protocol shows good robustness and can guarantee uniformly ultimate boundedness of affine formation errors. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019

Iterative Learning Method for In-Flight Auto-Tuning of UAV Controllers Based on Basic Sensory Information,"With an increasing number of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), solutions supporting the improvement in their precision of operation and safety of autonomous flights are gaining importance. They are particularly crucial in transportation tasks, where control systems are required to provide a stable and controllable flight in various environmental conditions, especially after changing the total mass of the UAV (by adding extra load). In the paper, the problem of using only available basic sensory information for fast, locally best, iterative real-time auto-tuning of parameters of fixed-gain altitude controllers is considered. The machine learning method proposed for this purpose is based on a modified zero-order optimization algorithm (golden-search algorithm) and bootstrapping technique. It has been validated in numerous simulations and real-world experiments in terms of its effectiveness in such aspects as: the impact of environmental disturbances (wind gusts); flight with change in mass; and change of sensory information sources in the auto-tuning procedure. The main advantage of the proposed method is that for the trajectory primitives repeatedly followed by an UAV (for programmed controller gains), the method effectively minimizes the selected performance index (cost function). Such a performance index might, e.g., express indirect requirements about tracking quality and energy expenditure. In the paper, a comprehensive description of the method, as well as a wide discussion of the results obtained from experiments conducted in the AeroLab for a low-cost UAV (Bebop 2), are included. The results have confirmed high efficiency of the method at the expected, low computational complexity.",Drone,2019
UAV Sensor Fault Detection Using a Classifier without Negative Samples: A Local Density Regulated Optimization Algorithm,"Fault detection for sensors of unmanned aerial vehicles is essential for ensuring flight security, in which the flight control system conducts real-time control for the vehicles relying on the sensing information from sensors, and erroneous sensor data will lead to false flight control commands, causing undesirable consequences. However, because of the scarcity of faulty instances, it still remains a challenging issue for flight sensor fault detection. The one-class support vector machine approach is a favorable classifier without negative samples, however, it is sensitive to outliers that deviate from the center and lacks a mechanism for coping with them. The compactness of its decision boundary is influenced, leading to the degradation of detection rate. To deal with this issue, an optimized one-class support vector machine approach regulated by local density is proposed in this paper, which regulates the tolerance extents of its decision boundary to the outliers according to their extent of abnormality indicated by their local densities. The application scope of the local density theory is narrowed to keep the internal instances unchanged and a rule for assigning the outliers continuous density coefficients is raised. Simulation results on a real flight control system model have proved its effectiveness and superiority.",Drone,2019
Ensuring the Safety Sustainability of Large UAS: Learning from the Maintenance Risk Dynamics of USAF MQ-1 Predator Fleet in Last Two Decades,"The mishap statistics of large military unmanned aerial systems (UAS) reveal that human errors and organizational flaws pose great threats to their operation safety, especially considering the future application of derived civilian types. Moreover, maintenance accidents due to human factors have reached a significant level, but have received little attention in the existing research. To ensure the safety and sustainability of large UAS, we propose a system dynamics approach to model the maintenance risk mechanisms involving organizational, human, and technical factors, which made a breakthrough in the traditional event-chain static analysis method. Using the United States Air Force (USAF) MQ-1 Predator fleet case, the derived time-domain simulation represented the risk evolution process of the past two decades and verified the rationality of the proposed model. It was identified that the effects of maintainer human factors on the accident rate exceeded those of the technical systems in a long-term view, even though the technical reliability improvements had obvious initial effects on risk reduction. The characteristics of maintainer errors should be considered in system and maintenance procedure design to prevent them in a proactive way. It is also shown that the approach-derived SD model can be developed into a semi-quantitative decision-making support tool for improving the safety of large UAS in a risk-based view of airworthiness.",Drone,2019
Wind Turbine Surface Damage Detection by Deep Learning Aided Drone Inspection Analysis,"Timely detection of surface damages on wind turbine blades is imperative for minimizing downtime and avoiding possible catastrophic structural failures. With recent advances in drone technology, a large number of high-resolution images of wind turbines are routinely acquired and subsequently analyzed by experts to identify imminent damages. Automated analysis of these inspection images with the help of machine learning algorithms can reduce the inspection cost. In this work, we develop a deep learning-based automated damage suggestion system for subsequent analysis of drone inspection images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve almost human-level precision in terms of suggested damage location and types on wind turbine blades. We further demonstrate that for relatively small training sets, advanced data augmentation during deep learning training can better generalize the trained model, providing a significant gain in precision.Dataset: doi:10.17632/hd96prn3nc.1",Drone,2019
Automated Enemy Avoidance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Reinforcement Learning,"This paper focuses on one of the collision avoidance scenarios for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where the UAV needs to avoid collision with the enemy UAV during its flying path to the goal point. Such a type of problem is defined as the enemy avoidance problem in this paper. To deal with this problem, a learning based framework is proposed. Under this framework, the enemy avoidance problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and the maneuver policies for the UAV are learned based on a temporal-difference reinforcement learning method called Sarsa. To handle the enemy avoidance problem in continuous state space, the Cerebellar Model Arithmetic Computer (CMAC) function approximation technique is embodied in the proposed framework. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulation environment is established. Simulation results show that the UAV agent can learn a satisfying policy under the proposed framework. Comparing with the random policy and the fixed-rule policy, the learned policy can achieve a far higher possibility in reaching the goal point without colliding with the enemy UAV.",Drone,2019
Research on the Collision Avoidance Algorithm for Fixed-Wing UAVs Based on Maneuver Coordination and Planned Trajectories Prediction,"This paper presents a novel collision avoidance (CA) algorithm for a cooperative fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method is based on maneuver coordination and planned trajectory prediction. Each aircraft in a conflict generates three available maneuvers and predicts the corresponding planned trajectories. The algorithm coordinates planned trajectories between participants in a conflict, determines which combination of planned trajectories provides the best separation, eventually makes an agreement on the maneuver for collision avoidance and activates the preferred maneuvers when a collision is imminent. The emphasis is placed on providing protection for UAVs, while activating maneuvers late enough to reduce interference, which is necessary for collision avoidance in the formation and clustering of UAVs. The CA has been validated with various simulations to show the advantage of collision avoidance for continuous conflicts in multiple, high-dynamic, high-density and three-dimensional (3D) environments. It eliminates the disadvantage of traditional CA, which has high uncertainty, and takes the performance parameters of different aircraft into consideration and makes full use of the maneuverability of fixed-wing aircraft.",Drone,2019
Rigorous Boresight Self-Calibration of Mobile and UAV LiDAR Scanning Systems by Strip Adjustment,"Mobile LiDAR Scanning (MLS) systems and UAV LiDAR Scanning (ULS) systems equipped with precise Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioning units and LiDAR sensors are used at an increasing rate for the acquisition of high density and high accuracy point clouds because of their safety and efficiency. Without careful calibration of the boresight angles of the MLS systems and ULS systems, the accuracy of data acquired would degrade severely. This paper proposes an automatic boresight self-calibration method for the MLS systems and ULS systems using acquired multi-strip point clouds. The boresight angles of MLS systems and ULS systems are expressed in the direct geo-referencing equation and corrected by minimizing the misalignments between points scanned from different directions and different strips. Two datasets scanned by MLS systems and two datasets scanned by ULS systems were used to verify the proposed boresight calibration method. The experimental results show that the root mean square errors (RMSE) of misalignments between point correspondences of the four datasets after boresight calibration are 2.1 cm, 3.4 cm, 5.4 cm, and 6.1 cm, respectively, which are reduced by 59.6%, 75.4%, 78.0%, and 94.8% compared with those before boresight calibration.",Drone,2019
A Precise and GNSS-Free Landing System on Moving Platforms for Rotary-Wing UAVs,"This article presents a precise landing system that allows rotary-wing UAVs to approach and land safely on moving platforms, without using GNSS at any stage of the landing maneuver, and with a centimeter level accuracy and high level of robustness. This system implements a novel concept where the relative position and velocity between the aerial vehicle and the landing platform are calculated from the angles of a cable that physically connects the UAV and the landing platform. The use of a cable also incorporates a number of extra benefits, such as increasing the precision in the control of the UAV altitude. It also facilitates centering the UAV right on top of the expected landing position, and increases the stability of the UAV just after contacting the landing platform. The system was implemented in an unmanned helicopter and many tests were carried out under different conditions for measuring the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed solution. Results show that the developed system allowed landing with centimeter accuracy by using only local sensors and that the helicopter could follow the landing platform in multiple trajectories at different velocities.",Drone,2019
Distributed Cooperative Onboard Planning for the Conflict Resolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The distributed cooperative onboard conflict resolution problem of unmanned aerial vehicles is studied in this paper. First, the dynamics of unmanned aerial vehicles and the safe separation constraint are studied. The monotonicity feature of the constraint condition is analyzed. The distributed conflict resolution problem is modeled as a distributed constraint optimization problem. Second, the distributed constraint optimization problem is solved in two steps. The feasible solutions are searched first, and the overall costs are minimized thereafter. The distributed stochastic gradient descent method is proposed to search the local near-optimal solutions. The self-improving mechanism is proposed to enhance the utilization efficiency of data exchanged among unmanned aerial vehicles. The ""virtue adjustment"" theorem is defined to motivate the cooperative coordination between unmanned aerial vehicles.

Software-defined unmanned aerial vehicles networking for video dissemination services,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) empower people to reach endangered areas under emergency situations. By collaborating with each other, multiple UAVs forming a UAV network (UAVNet) could work together to perform specific tasks in a more efficient and intelligent way than having a single UAV. UAVNets pose special characteristics of high dynamics, unstable aerial wireless links, and UAV collision probabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Software-Defined UAV Networking (SD-UAVNet) architecture, which facilitates the management of UAV networks through a centralized SDN UAV controller. In addition, we introduce a use case scenario to evaluate the optimal UAV relay node placement for life video surveillance services with the proposed architecture. In the SD-UAVNet architecture, the controller considers the global UAV relevant context information to optimize the UAVs' movements, selects proper routing paths, and prevents UAVs from collisions to determine the relay nodes deployment and guarantee satisfactory video quality. The experimental results show that the proposed SD-UAVNet architecture can effectively mitigate the challenges of UAVNet and it provides suitable Quality of Experience (QoE) to end-users.

A UAV Situational Awareness Method through the Threat-Related Relation Reasoning between UAV and Surrounding Objects,"As the technological capabilities of UAV(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) improves, studies are being carried out to intelligently analyze and understand the situation of UAV in order to gain access to the target area while recognizing and avoiding various risks. To achieve the mission of UAV, it is necessary to judge the situation accurately and quickly. To do this, this paper proposes ways to infer the threat-related relationship between an UAV and perceived surrounding objects through a 3 step approach and provide abstract information about the situation of UAV. The first step is to instantiate the object data recognized by UAV to be utilized for ontology and rule-based reasoning.The second step is to define the priority of instantiated object data and to infer the threat-related relationship between them. Finally, recognizing the situation through the relationship inference that takes into account the association between current and past inferred relationships. To evaluation the performance of the proposed method, a virtual UAV environment simulator was built and tested the data 1,000 times that were randomly generated through five sequential UAV moving point paths. Eight kinds of objects could be recognized in UAV path and ten kinds of relationships can be inferred. Overall performance of situation Awareness was an average of 91 percent.",Drone,2019
Battery health management for small-size rotary-wing electric unmanned aerial vehicles: An efficient approach for constrained computing platforms,"This article presents a holistic framework for the design, implementation and experimental validation of Battery Management Systems (BMS) in rotatory-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allows to accurately (i) estimate the State of Charge (SOC), and (ii) predict the End of Discharge (EOD) time of lithium-polymer batteries in small-size multirotors by using a model-based prognosis architecture that is efficient and feasible to implement in low-cost hardware. The proposed framework includes a simplified battery model that incorporates the electric load dependence, temperature dependence and SOC dependence by using the concept of Artificial Evolution to estimate some of its parameters, along with a novel Outer Feedback Correction Loop (OFCL) during the estimation stage which adjusts the variance of the process noise to diminish bias in Bayesian state estimation and helps to compensate problems associated with incorrect initial conditions in a non-observable dynamic system.

Prescribed performance-based distributed fault-tolerant cooperative control for multi-UAVs,"In this paper, a prescribed performance-based distributed neural adaptive fault-tolerant cooperative control (FTCC) scheme is proposed for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs). A distributed sliding-mode observer (SMO) technique is first utilized to estimate the leader UAV's reference. Then, by transforming the tracking errors of follower UAVs with respect to the estimated references into a new set, a distributed neural adaptive FTCC protocol is developed based on the combination of dynamic surface control (DSC) and minimal learning parameters of neural network (MLPNN). Moreover, auxiliary dynamic systems are exploited to deal with input saturation. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, and tracking errors of follower UAVs with respect to the estimated references are confined within the prescribed bounds. Finally, comparative simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed neural adaptive FTCC scheme.",Drone,2019
Bi-level Flight Path Planning of UAV Formations with Collision Avoidance,"This paper deals with the problem of generating 3D flight paths for a swarm of cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vechicles (UAVs) flying in a formation having a prespecified shape, in the presence of polygonal obstacles, no-fly zones and other non cooperative aircraft. UAVs are modeled as Dubins flying vehicles with bounds on the turning radius and flight path climb/descent angle. A Reduced Visibility Graph (RVG) based method, connecting selected nodes by means of circular arcs and segments, is adopted to minimize the length of each path. Then, to keep as much as possible the formation shape while flying between obstacles, the RVG is refined with the addition of so called Rendez-Vous Waypoints (RVWs). These are placed between groups of obstacles where it is impossible to maintain the desired formation. Waypoints locations and UAVs paths are optimized using a bi-level game theoretic approach based on the leader-follower Stackelberg model, where the lower level and upper level problems are the search of the shortest paths and the optimal locations of waypoints respectively. Such an approach allows to fly between obstacles, dispersing the formation and forcing UAVs to recompose it at given waypoints (RVWs) beyond groups of obstacles. Collision avoidance among UAVs and possible non-cooperative aircrafts, called intruders, is then achieved solving a set of linear quadratic optimization problems based on an original geometric based formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of numerical simulations where RVWs positions are optimized via a genetic algorithm.",Drone,2019
Multi-UAV Carrier Phase Differential GPS and Vision-based Sensing for High Accuracy Attitude Estimation,"This paper presents a cooperative navigation technique which exploits relative vision-based sensing and carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) among antennas embarked on different flying platforms, to provide accurate UAV attitude estimates in real time or in post-processing phase. It is assumed that all UAVs are under nominal GPS coverage. The logical architecture and the main algorithmic steps are highlighted, and the adopted CDGPS processing strategy is described. The experimental setup used to evaluate the proposed approach comprises two multi-rotors and two ground antennas, one of which is used as a benchmark for attitude accuracy estimation. Results from flight tests are presented in which the attitude solution obtained by integrating CDGPS and vision (CDGPS/Vision) measurements within and Extended Kalman Filter is compared with estimates provided by the onboard navigation system and with the results of a formerly developed code-based differential GPS (DGPS/Vision) approach. Benchmark-based analyses confirm that CDGPS/Vision approach outperforms both onboard navigation system and DGPS/Vision approach.",Drone,2019
A non-decoupled backstepping control for fixed-wing UAVs with multivariable fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer,"This paper addresses the issue of controlling the attitude together with the airspeed of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in a vector manner.

The rigid body dynamics are established in the form of vectors, which are the velocity vector and angular velocity vector in a body-fixed coordinate frame. Vector backstepping control and multivariable fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observers are then proposed on the dynamics to ensure that the disturbances and uncertainties can be estimated and cancelled in a fixed time, and the states of the system are driven towards the expected manifolds, and stay there for all future times. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Drone,2019
Drone Warfare in Waziristan and the New Military Humanism,"US drone warfare in Waziristan has been legitimated through a discourse of military humanism that claims very low rates of civilian casualties and a concern to spare the lives of the innocent. In practice, in concert with the Pakistani government's counterinsurgency campaign and the tactics of the Taliban, drone strikes in Waziristan have killed substantial numbers of civilians and, in a manner reminiscent of the effects of death squads in Central and Latin America, have torn apart Waziri civil society while creating a culture of terror. ""Drone essentialism"" (a false conviction that drones are inevitably used in a way that minimizes suffering) has concealed a process of ""ethical slippage"" through which drone operators relaxed their operational practices. This process of slippage enabled drones to become terror weapons even as they functioned at the level of discourse as alibis-signifiers of discriminate force. One task of anthropological analysis is to prize open the contradictions inherent in this situation.",Drone,2019
Strong Tracking Tobit Kalman Filter with Model Uncertainties,"The Tobit Kalman filter (TKF) is a good choice for applications of discrete time-varying systems with censored measurements. The traditional TKF is usually designed under the assumption of exactly knowing system state and measurement functions, which can not guarantee the good performance and is even unsuitable for system with model mismatch. To ensure the performance, this paper proposes a novel TKF algorithm in the presence of both censored measurements and model uncertainties. Our proposed algorithm, called strong tracking TKF (STTKF), adopts the orthogonal principle as an additional criterion to overcome model mismatch problem. By introducing fading factor into a priori error covariance, STTKF adaptively adjust gain matrix according to different model mismatch degree. Firstly the recursive fading factor formulation is deduced based on orthogonal principle. Then the designed STTKF process is given in a recursive manner. Finally the effectiveness of STTKF is verified by two examples of oscillator system and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transmitter.",Drone,2019
Real-Time UAS Guidance for Continuous Curved GNSS Approaches,"This paper presents new efficient guidance algorithms allowing Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) to avoid a variety of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) continuity and integrity performance threats detected by an Aircraft Based Augmentation System (ABAS). In particular, the UAS guidance problem is formulated as an optimal control-based Multi-Objective Trajectory Optimization (MOTO) problem subject to suitable dynamic and geometric constraints. Direct transcription methods of the global orthogonal collocation (pseudospectral) family are exploited for the solution of the MOTO problem, generating optimal trajectories for curved GNSS approaches in real-time. Three degrees-of-freedom aircraft dynamics models and suitable GNSS satellite visibility models based on Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation ephemeris data are utilised in the MOTO solution algorithm. The performance of the proposed MOTO algorithm is evaluated in representative simulation case studies adopting the JAVELIN UAS as the reference platform. The paper focusses on descent and initial curved GNSS approach phases in a Terminal Maneuvering Area (TMA) scenario, where multiple manned/unmanned aircraft converge on the same short and curved final GNSS approach leg. The results show that the adoption of MOTO based on pseudospectral methods allows an efficient exploitation of ABAS model-predictive augmentation features in online GNSS guidance tasks, supporting the calculation of suitable arrival trajectories in 7 to 16 s using a normal PC.",Drone,2019
Fault-Tolerant Containment Control of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Distributed Sliding-Mode Observer,"This paper investigates the distributed fault-tolerant containment control (FTCC) of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAVs) when a subset of multi-UAVs is encountered by actuator faults and input saturation. The topology involving multiple follower UAVs and leader UAVs is an undirected, fixed communication network and only a subset of follower UAVs has access to the leader UAVs. By the combination of graph theory and sliding-mode observer (SMO), the desired reference of each follower is first estimated in a distributed manner. Then, by utilizing the estimated knowledge, a set of distributed control laws is iteratively designed to steer follower UAVs into the convex hull spanned by the leader UAVs. In the distributed control scheme, disturbance observer (DO) technique is used to estimate unknown lumped uncertainty including external disturbances and actuator faults. An auxiliary dynamic system is constructed to compensate the input saturation. Moreover, to eliminate the explosion of complexity in traditional backstepping architecture, high-gain observer (HGO) technique is integrated into the backstepping architecture to estimate the virtual control signals and their first derivatives. Furthermore, by using graph theory and Lyapunov-based approach, it is shown that the distributed fault-tolerant containment controller can guarantee all follower UAVs to converge into the convex hull spanned by all leader UAVs. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed control scheme.",Drone,2019
Output Feedback Image-Based Visual Servoing of Rotorcrafts,"This paper presents an improved output feedback based image-based visual servoing (IBVS) law for rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles (RUAVs). The control law enables a RUAV with a minimal set of sensors, i.e. an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a single downward facing camera, to regulate its position and heading relative to a planar visual target consisting of multiple points. As compared to our previous work, twofold improvement is made. First, the desired value of the image feature of controlling the vertical motion of the RUAV is a function of other image features instead of a constant. This modification helps to keep the visual target stay in the camera's field of view by indirectly adjusting the height of the vehicle. Second, the proposed approach simplifies our previous output feedback law by reducing the dimension of the observer filter state space while the same asymptotic stability result is kept. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.",Drone,2019
Control-enabled Observability and Sensitivity Functions in Visual-Inertial Odometry,"Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) is an important component in autonomous navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in GPS-denied or degraded environments. VIO is a nonlinear estimation problem where control inputs, such as acceleration and angular velocity, have significant impact on the estimation performance. In this paper, we examine the effects of controls on the VIO problem. We first propose a sensitivity function that characterizes the relationship between the errors in the control inputs and the state estimation performance. This function depends on the control inputs, which is unique for nonlinear systems since for linear systems, state observability properties are independent of control inputs. We next derive analytical expressions of the sensitivity functions for various VIO scenarios relevant to UAV motions. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we validate the derived sensitivity functions. We also show an interesting fact that deceleration along the velocity direction yields better estimation performance than acceleration with the same magnitude.",Drone,2019
Distributed UAV Loss Detection and Auto-replacement Protocol with Guaranteed Properties,"Multi-UAV systems are becoming a true reality. They have wide applications in surveillance, search, hazardous rescue and other civil services. Currently, an important challenge is the robust control against UAV failures. In this paper, the distributed UAV loss detection and auto-replacement scheme is discussed. The basic idea is to use the cooperative method to control the multi-UAV system to accomplish the missions. This is achieved by exchanging heartbeats (HBs) and information fusion. We first use the obtained information to detect if one UAV is lost. Subsequently, an auto-replacement logic is used to send a UAV with low priority to occupy the target position or task which was assigned to the lost UAV. Next, a recovery algorithm is proposed when a newly inserted UAV or a lost UAV is recovered from failures. Finally, the proposed scheme is tested by computer simulations and real experiments.",Drone,2019
Quantifying Risk of Ground Impact Fatalities for Small Unmanned Aircraft,"One of the major challenges of conducting operations of unmanned aircraft, especially operations beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS), is to make a realistic and sufficiently detailed risk assessment. An important part of such an assessment is to identify the risk of fatalities, preferably in a quantitative way since this allows for comparison with manned aviation to determine whether an equivalent level of safety is achievable. This work presents a method for quantifying the probability of fatalities resulting from an uncontrolled descent of an unmanned aircraft conducting a BVLOS flight. The method is based on a standard stochastic model, and employs a parameterized high fidelity ground impact distribution model that accounts for both aircraft specifications, parameter uncertainties, and wind. The method also samples the flight path to create an almost continuous quantification of the risk as a function of mission flight time. The methodology is exemplified with a 180 km flight in Danish airspace with a Penguin C aircraft.",Drone,2019
An Adaptive Dynamic Controller for Quadrotor to Perform Trajectory Tracking Tasks,"This work proposes an adaptive dynamic controller to guide an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) when accomplishing trajectory tracking tasks. The controller structure consists of a kinematic controller that generates reference commands to a dynamic compensator in charge of changing the reference commands according to the system dynamics. The final control actions thus generated are then sent to the UAV to make it to track an arbitrary trajectory in the 3D space. The parameters of the dynamic compensator are directly updated during navigation, configuring a directly updated self-tuning regulator with input error, aiming at reducing the tracking errors, thus improving the system performance in task accomplishment. After describing the control system thus designed, its stability is proved using the Lyapunov theory. To validate the proposed system simulations and real experiments were run, some of them are reported here, whose results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control system and its good performance, even when the initial values of the parameters associated to the dynamic model of the UAV are completely unknown. One of the conclusions, regarding the results obtained, is that the proposed system can be used as if it were an on-line identification subsystem, since the parameters converge to values that effectively represent the UAV dynamics.",Drone,2019
Collision-Free Trajectory Generation and Tracking for UAVs Using Markov Decision Process in a Cluttered Environment,"A collision-free trajectory generation and tracking method capable of re-planning unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectories can increase flight safety and decrease the possibility of mission failures. In this paper, a Markov decision process (MDP) based algorithm combined with backtracking method is presented to create a safe trajectory in the case of hostile environments. Subsequently, a differential flatness method is adopted to smooth the profile of the rerouted trajectory for satisfying the UAV physical constraints. Lastly, a flight controller based on passivity-based control (PBC) is designed to maintain UAV's stability and trajectory tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV with the proposed strategy is capable of avoiding obstacles in a hostile environment.",Drone,2019
Robust Trajectory Tracking for Unmanned Aircraft Systems using a Nonsingular Terminal Modified Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Controller,"Precision trajectory tracking problem for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) is addressed in this work. A novel algorithm that combines a Nonsingular Modified Super-Twisting Controller with a High Order Sliding Mode Observer to enable an aerial vehicle tracking a desired trajectory under the assumption that i) its translational velocities are not available and ii) there are unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. The proposed Sliding Mode Controller is based on a nonlinear sliding mode surface that ensures that the position and velocity tracking errors of all system's state variables converge to zero in finite time. Moreover, the proposed controller generates a continuous control signal eliminating the chattering phenomenon. Finally, simulation results and an extensive set of experiments are presented in order to illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.",Drone,2019
Parametric Study on Formation Flying Effectiveness for a Blended-Wing UAV,"This paper investigates aerodynamic performance improvements of formation flight at transonic speeds for a medium size Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The metric for assessing the aerodynamic improvement of formation flight is the computed drag. The total drag for each formation configuration is compared with a single UAV, where a final drag reduction percentage is estimated. The evaluation of the aerodynamic performance is conducted by employing an in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver, grid generation and post processing tools. For critical understanding of the tendency of the formation efficiency depending on main parameters, broad formation configurations are analysed. The parameterisation includes number of aircraft, proximity and formation shape. Full realisation of the benefit predicted would need to be proven in the real world, but there is sufficient confidence to suggest that it exist: the empirical parametric analysis suggests that formation flight can improves aerodynamic performance and formation configuration greatly influence the degree of improvement.",Drone,2019
Internal flow and external jet characteristics of double serpentine nozzle with different aspect ratio,"In order to increase the survivability of the fighter aircraft, the serpentine nozzle has been applied in series of stealth bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles due to its excellent potentiality of evidently suppressing the infrared radiation signatures and radar cross section emitted by engine exhausts. Among the geometric parameters of the serpentine nozzle, the aspect ratio (AR) at the nozzle exit is one of the most critical parameters for the nozzle design as the infrared suppression effect could be greatly enhanced with the increment of AR by strengthening the mixing between the exhaust plume and atmosphere; the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the AR on the flow characteristics of the double serpentine nozzle. The flow features of six double serpentine convergent nozzles, i.e. AR = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15 respectively, were numerically simulated with the shear stress transport kappa-omega turbulent model adopted, which had been validated by the experimental data. The characteristics of internal flow and external jet, and the aerodynamic performances of these six nozzles were compared. Results show that the Ma contours at the symmetric plane are different due to the distinct flow accelerations caused by the change of the curvature and the duct height for diverse AR, and the surface pressure and the shock wave features are different correspondingly. The lateral divergence and the lateral convergence characteristics of the nozzle configuration lead to opposite lateral flow under diverse AR, and the change of lateral width induced different lateral pressure gradient, then lead to various lateral vortex distributions. The length of potential core is the contribution of the comprehensive effects of geometry parameters, and it is decreased with the increase of AR due to the dominated effect of the increased mixing area; however, the declining rate is slowed down. The AR of 5 should be chosen for the best aerodynamic performance of the double serpentine nozzle under the qualifications to completely shield the high-temperature turbine.",Drone,2019
Conceptual design and optimization of a tilt-rotor micro air vehicle,"The conceptual design and optimization of a tilt-rotor Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) for a well-defined mission are performed. The objective of this design cycle is to decrease the design time in order to efficiently create a functional tilt-rotor drone. A flight mission is firstly defined for a tiltrotor MAV performing hovering and cruise flight scenarios. Secondly, a complex wing shape is chosen and modeled in order to determine the final shape. The initial shape is scaled in order to acquire an arbitrary wingspan of one meter. For the specific area and wingspan, the aspect ratio of the designed wing shape is found to be equal to 2.32. Thirdly, a constraint analysis of the MAV is performed by using an energy balance analysis for six different flight scenarios. This analysis yields the required power loading and wing loading. Fourthly, the weight of the vehicle is estimated using both statistical and computational methods. After estimating the total weight and the wing loading of the MAV, the surface of the wing is determined, yielding a final wingspan of 0.76 m. Subsequently, considering the total weight of the designed MAV, the needed lift coefficient is determined. Fifthly, using the lift coefficient in conjunction with XLFR5, a batch of airfoils is selected and analyzed to evaluate the aerodynamic coefficients of the wing with each airfoil. This analysis ultimately leads to the optimum airfoil being selected. Finally, design of the fuselage and tail, internal components selection, and servo-mechanisms design are carried out prior to a stability analysis. All these proposed steps are needed to design efficient and functional tilt-rotor MAVs. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",Drone,2019
Reliable flight performance assessment of multirotor based on interacting multiple model particle filter and health degree,"Multirotor has been applied to many military and civilian mission scenarios. From the perspective of reliability, it is difficult to ensure that multirotors do not generate hardware and software failures or performance anomalies during the flight process. These failures and anomalies may result in mission interruptions, crashes, and even threats to the lives and property of human beings. Thus, the study of flight reliability problems of multirotors is conductive to the development of the drone industry and has theoretical significance and engineering value. This paper proposes a reliable flight performance assessment method of multirotors based on an Interacting Multiple Model Particle Filter (IMMPF) algorithm and health degree as the performance indicator. First, the multirotor is modeled by the Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) model, and the problem of reliable flight performance assessment is formulated. In order to solve the problem, the IMMPF algorithm is presented to estimate the real-time probability distribution of hybrid state of the established SHS-based multirotor model, since it can decrease estimation errors compared with the standard interacting multiple model algorithm based on extended Kalman filter. Then, the reliable flight performance is assessed with health degree based on the estimation result. Finally, a case study of a multirotor suffering from sensor anomalies is presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Efficiency optimized fuel supply strategy of aircraft engine based on air-fuel ratio control,"Accurate fuel injection control of aircraft engine can optimize the energy efficiency of UAV power system while meeting the propeller speed requirement. Traditional injection control method such as open-loop calibration causes instability of fuel supply which brings the risk of power loss of UAV. Considering that the closed-loop control of AFR can ensure a stable fuel feeding, this paper proposes an AFR control based fuel supply strategy in order to improve the efficiency of fuel-powered UAV while obtaining the required engine speed. According to the optimum fuel injection results, we implement fuzzy-PID method to control the set AFR in different situations. Through simulation and experiment studies, the results indicate that, to begin with, the calibrated mathematical model of the aircraft engine is effective. Next, this fuel supply strategy based on AFR control can normally realize the engine speed regulation, and the applied control algorithm can eliminate the overshoot of AFR throughout all the working progress. What is more, the fuel supply strategy can averagely shorten the response time of the engine speed by about two seconds. In addition, compared with the open-loop calibration, in this work the power efficiency is improved by 9% to 33%. Last but not the least, the endurance can be improved by 30 min with a normal engine speed. This paper can be a reference for the optimization of UAV aircraft engine.

Aerodynamic Characteristics of Elastic Wings Morphed and Vibrated in Uniform Flows and Separated Flows Around Them,"In this study, experimental investigation is performed into modification to aerodynamic characteristics by distortion and vibration of planar wings with various Young's modulus as well as flow fields around them. Motions of the wings are captured with a high-speed camera. Flows around them are evaluated with phase locked PIV technique. As a result, bending vibration of the wings is observed almost all over the angles of attack while twisting is observed around the angles giving maximum lift force. The twisting vibration causes larger aerodynamic forces and delay in the stall. It is found that amplitude of the twisting determines magnitude of variations in aerodynamic forces. Flow field measurement shows the twisting vibration generates periodic vortices shedding from the leading and trailing edges. They reduce the separation bubble on the wing, in particular, around the middle span in spite of localization of the twisting in the vicinity of the wing tip.",Drone,2019
Robust UAV-based tracking using hybrid classifiers,"Visual object tracking is a key factor for unmanned aerial vehicles. In this paper, we propose a robust and effective visual object tracking method with an appearance model based on the locally adaptive regression kernel. The proposed appearance model encodes the geometric structure of the target. The tracking problem is formulated as two binary classifiers via two support vector machines (SVMs) with online model update. The backward tracking which tracks the target in reverse of time is utilized to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the two SVMs. The final locations are adaptively fused based on the results of the forward tracking and backward tracking validation. Several state-of-the-art tracking algorithms are evaluated on large-scale benchmark datasets which include challenging factors such as heavy occlusion, pose variation, illumination variation and motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves appealing performance.",Drone,2019
Airspace map design to implement customer-friendly service on unmanned aerial vehicles,"Today, as the number of drones has suddenly increased, the problems of collision between drones in low altitude flight and Traffic control in drone flight have been highlighted. The collision between drones has a potential danger that can be extended to a very serious accident, which is directly linked to the second or third accident rather than the first accident. More detailed and thorough air traffic management is essential in order to minimize the collisions between drones and predict or address the collision before the collision occurs. However, the current unmanned traffic management technology is a basic research level and it is urgent to establish the concept.Therefore, the purpose of this study is to design and compare the airspace maps for drones, which is a core technical element in construction of drone Traffic control system.

Bio-Inspired Autonomous Visual Vertical and Horizontal Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Near-ground manoeuvres, such as landing, are key elements in unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. Traditionally, these manoeuvres have been done using external reference frames to measure or estimate the velocity and the height of the vehicle. Complex near-ground manoeuvres are performed by flying animals with ease. These animals perform these complex manoeuvres by exclusively using the information from their vision and vestibular system. In this paper, we use the Tau theory, a visual strategy that, is believed, is used by many animals to approach objects, as a solution for relative ground distance control for unmanned vehicles. In this paper, it is shown how this approach can be used to perform near-ground manoeuvres in a vertical and horizontal manner on a moving target without the knowledge of height and velocity of either the vehicle or the target. The proposed system is tested with simulations. Here, it is shown that, using the proposed methods, the vehicle is able to perform landing on a moving target, and also they enable the user to choose the dynamic characteristics of the approach.",Drone,2019

Estimating Pylon Height Using Differences in Shadows Between GF-2 Images,"Information on height of pylon is important when planning the routes of unmanned aerial vehicles. This paper proposes a new automatic method for estimating pylon height using shadow differences between GF-2 satellite images taken at different times. Initially, the spectral distribution features and triangular shape of pylon shadows are used for shadow detection to enhance the difference from other land objects using images taken at a greater sun elevation angle. Then, the difference in the shadows of the same pylon in images taken at different times and shadow-imaging principles are used to estimate the vertical of the pylon top to avoid interference from complex land objects. Finally, the height of the pylon is approximated using the distance from the vertical projection point to the shadow point of the pylon top and sun elevation angle. GF-2 images were selected and included five pylons in the target area. The average error of the estimated height was 1.56m, and the relative error was only 2.74%.",Drone,2019

Secure UAV Communication With Cooperative Jamming and Trajectory Control,"This letter presents a new cooperative jamming approach to secure the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication by leveraging jamming from other nearby UAVs to defend against the eavesdropping. In particular, we consider a two-UAV scenario when one UAV transmitter delivers the confidential information to a ground node (GN), and the other UAV jammer cooperatively sends the artificial noise to confuse the ground eavesdropper for protecting the confidentiality of the data transmission. By exploiting the fully controllable mobility, the two UAVs can adaptively adjust their locations over time (a.k.a. trajectories) to facilitate the secure communication and cooperative jamming. We assume that the two UAVs perfectly know the GN's location and partially know the eavesdropper's location a priori. Under this setup, we maximize the average secrecy rate from the UAV transmitter to the GN over one particular time period, by optimizing the UAVs' trajectories, jointly with their communicating/jamming power allocations. Although the formulated problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient solution by applying the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation.",Drone,2019
Design and Evaluation of UAV Flow Angle Estimation Filters,"This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of four filters for the estimation of angle of attack (AOA) and angle of sideslip (AOS) of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, two novel filters (a complementary filter and an extended Kalman filter) are proposed and evaluated without using direct flow angle and Global Positioning System measurements; two existing AOA/AOS filters are also implemented and evaluated. All filters are designed with minimal inputs and states to ensure the ease of implementation, simplicity of tuning, and computation efficiency. Both simulation and UAV flight test results show the performance of the proposed filters. Especially, flight test results from two different UAVs (a T-tail UAV and a flying wing UAV) show that the root mean square errors of estimated inertial AOA and AOS are less than 1.5 degrees under nominal flight conditions and around 2 degrees under aggressive maneuvers compared with direct flow angle measurements.",Drone,2019
Multiple Antenna Aided NOMA in UAV Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach,"This paper investigates the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) networks. By utilizing a stochastic geometry model, a new 3-D UAV framework for providing wireless service to randomly roaming NOMA users has been proposed. In an effort to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic rate of MIMO-NOMA enhanced UAV networks. We examine tractable upper bounds for the whole proposed framework, with deriving asymptotic results for scenarios that transmit power of interference sources being proportional or being fixed to the UAV. For obtaining more insights for the proposed framework, we investigate the diversity order and high signal-to-noise slope of MIMO-NOMA assisted UAV networks. Our results confirm that: 1) Outage probability of NOMA enhanced UAV networks is affected to a large extent by the targeted transmission rates and power allocation factors of NOMA users and 2) For the case that the interference power is proportional to the UAV power, there are error floors for the outage probabilities.",Drone,2019
An Empirical Air-to-Ground Channel Model Based on Passive Measurements in LTE,"In this paper, a recently conductedmeasurement campaign for unmanned-aerial-vehicle channels is introduced. The downlink signals of an in-service long-time-evolution network, which is deployed in a suburban scenario were acquired. Five horizontal and five vertical flight routes were considered. The channel impulse responses (CIRs) are extracted from the received data by exploiting the cell-specific signals, and the underlying physical propagation mechanisms are interpreted by exploiting the propagation graph modeling approach. Based on the CIRs, the parameters of multipath components are estimated by using a high-resolution algorithm derived according to the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle. Based on the SAGE results, channel characteristics including the path loss, shadow fading, fast fading, delay spread, and Doppler frequency spread are thoroughly investigated for different heights and horizontal distances, which constitute a stochastic model.",Drone,2019
Proactive Eavesdropping in UAV-Aided Suspicious Communication Systems,"This paper considers a new wireless information surveillance scenario, where a legitimate monitor tries to eavesdrop on the suspicious messages sent by an unmanned aerial vehicle aided suspicious transmitter. By using the characteristic of the suspicious system, we propose an effective proactive jamming scheme to maximize the achievable eavesdropping rate. A successive convex approximation based iterative algorithm is first developed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem. Based on this result, the eavesdropping rate maximization problem is then solved by applying the one-dimensional search method. Moreover, we also study the special case of two suspicious receivers for gaining more useful insights on designing the optimal jamming transmission strategy. Numerical results show that the proposed proactive jamming approach can significantly enhance the achievable eavesdropping rate compared to the reference scheme.",Drone,2019
Securing UAV Communications via Joint Trajectory and Power Control,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is anticipated to be widely applied in the forthcoming fifth-generation wireless networks, due to its many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand deployment. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight nature of air-to-ground wireless channels give rise to a new challenge on how to realize secure UAV communications with the destined nodes on the ground. This paper aims to tackle this challenge by applying the physical layer security technique. We consider both the downlink and uplink UAV communications with a ground node, namely, UAV-to-ground (U2G) and ground-to-UAV (G2U) communications, respectively, subject to a potential eavesdropper on the ground. In contrast to the existing literature on the wireless physical layer security only with the ground nodes at fixed or quasi-static locations, we exploit the high mobility of the UAV to proactively establish favorable and degraded channels for the legitimate and eavesdropping links, through its trajectory design. We formulate new problems to maximize the average secrecy rates of the U2G and G2U transmissions, by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, and the transmit power of the legitimate transmitter over a given flight period of the UAV. Although the formulated problems are non-convex, we propose iterative algorithms to solve them efficiently by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization methods. Specifically, both the transmit power and UAV trajectory are optimized, with the other being fixed in an alternating manner, until the algorithms converge. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can improve the secrecy rates for both U2G and G2U communications, as compared to other benchmark schemes without power control and/or trajectory optimization.",Drone,2019

UAV-Enabled Cooperative Jamming for Improving Secrecy of Ground Wiretap Channel,"This letter proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile jamming scheme to improve the secrecy rate of ground wiretap channel. Specifically, a UAV is employed to transmit jamming signals to combat against eavesdropping. Such a mobile jamming scheme is particularly appealing since the UAV-enabled jammer can fly close to the eavesdropper and opportunistically jam it by leveraging the UAV's mobility. We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and jamming power over a given flight period. To make the problem more tractable, we drive a closed-form lower bound for the achievable secrecy rate, based on which the UAV's trajectory and transmit power are optimized alternately by an efficient iterative algorithm applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design can significantly enhance the secrecy rate of the considered wiretap system as compared to benchmark schemes.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Optimal Resource Allocation for Embedded UAV Communication Systems,"We consider device-to-device (D2D) wireless information and power transfer systems using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a relay-assisted node. As the energy capacity and flight time of UAVs is limited, a significant issue in deploying UAV is to manage energy consumption in real-time application, which is proportional to the UAV transmit power. To tackle this important issue, we develop a real-time resource allocation algorithm for maximizing the energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the energy-harvesting time and power control for the considered (D2D) communication embedded with UAV. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms as running time for solving them can be conducted in milliseconds.",Drone,2019
Multi-UAV Reconnaissance Task Assignment for Heterogeneous Targets Based on Modified Symbiotic Organisms Search Algorithm,"This paper considers a reconnaissance task assignment problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with different sensor capacities. A modified Multi-Objective Symbiotic Organisms Search algorithm (MOSOS) is adopted to optimize UAVs' task sequence. A time-window based task model is built for heterogeneous targets. Then, the basic task assignment problem is formulated as a Multiple Time-Window based Dubins Travelling Salesmen Problem (MTWDTSP). Double-chain encoding rules and several criteria are established for the task assignment problem under logical and physical constraints. Pareto dominance determination and global adaptive scaling factors is introduced to improve the performance of original MOSOS. Numerical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation results for the task assignment problem are also presented in this paper, whereas comparisons with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and original MOSOS are made to verify the superiority of the proposed method. The simulation results demonstrate that modified SOS outperforms the original MOSOS and NSGA-II in terms of optimality and efficiency of the assignment results in MTWDTSP.",Drone,2019
Improvement of 3D Power Line Extraction from Multiple Low-Cost UAV Imagery Using Wavelet Analysis,"Three-dimensional (3D) mapping of power lines is very important for power line inspection. Many remotely-sensed data products like light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been already studied for power line surveys. More and more data are being obtained via photogrammetric measurements. This increases the need for the implementation of advanced processing techniques. In recent years, there have been several developments in visualisation techniques using UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) platform photography. The most modern of such imaging systems have the ability to generate dense point clouds. However, image-based point cloud accuracy is very often various (unstable) and dependent on the radiometric quality of images and the efficiency of image processing algorithms. The main factor influencing the point cloud quality is noise. Such problems usually arise with data obtained via low-cost UAV platforms. Therefore, generated point clouds representing power lines are usually incomplete and noisy. To obtain a complete and accurate 3D model of power lines and towers, it is necessary to develop improved data processing algorithms. The experiment tested the algorithms on power lines with different voltages. This paper presents the wavelet-based method of processing data acquired with a low-cost UAV camera. The proposed, original method involves the application of algorithms for coarse filtration and precise filtering. In addition, a new way of calculating the recommended flight height was proposed. At the end, the accuracy assessment of this two-stage filtration process was examined. For this, point quality indices were proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the quality of low-cost point clouds. The proposed methods improve the accuracy of determining the parameters of the lines by more than twice. About 10% of noise is reduced by using the wavelet-based approach.",Drone,2019
Sliding Mode Fault Tolerant Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with Sensor and Actuator Faults,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been developing rapidly recently, and the safety and the reliability of the UAV are significant to the mission execution and the life of UAV. Sensor and actuator failures of a UAV are one of the most common malfunctions, threating the safety and life of the UAV. Fault-tolerant control technology is an effective method to improve the reliability and safety of UAV, which also contributes to vehicle health management (VHM). This paper deals with the sliding mode fault-tolerant control of the UAV, considering the failures of sensor and actuator. Firstly, a terminal sliding surface is designed to ensure the state of the system on the sliding mode surface throughout the control process based on the simplified coupling dynamic model. Then, the sliding mode control (SMC) method combined with the RBF neural network algorithm is used to design the parameters of the sliding mode controller, and with this, the efficiency of the design process is improved and system chattering is minimized. Finally, the Simulink simulations are carried out using a fault tolerance controller under the conditions where accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor or actuator failures is assumed. The results show that the proposed control strategy is quite an effective method for the control of UAVs with accelerometer sensor, gyroscope sensor or actuator failures.",Drone,2019
Weak Degradation Characteristics Analysis of UAV Motors Based on Laplacian Eigenmaps and Variational Mode Decomposition,"Brushless direct current (BLDC) motors are the source of flight power during the operation of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and their working state directly affects the safety of the whole system. To predict and avoid motor faults, it is necessary to accurately understand the health degradation process of the motor before any fault occurs. However, in actual working conditions, due to the aerodynamic environmental conditions of the aircraft flight, the background noise components of the vibration signals characterizing the running state of the motor are complex and severely coupled, making it difficult for the weak degradation characteristics to be clearly reflected. To address these problems, a weak degradation characteristic extraction method based on variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) was proposed in this study to precisely identify the degradation information in system health data, avoid the loss of critical information and the interference of redundant information, and to optimize the description of a motor's degradation process despite the presence of complex background noise. A validation experiment was conducted on a specific type of motor under operation with load, to obtain the degradation characteristics of multiple types of vibration signals, and to test the proposed method. The results proved that this method can improve the stability and accuracy of predicting motor health, thereby helping to predict the degradation state and to optimize the maintenance strategies.",Drone,2019
Data Association for Multi-Object Tracking via Deep Neural Networks,"With recent advances in object detection, the tracking-by-detection method has become mainstream for multi-object tracking in computer vision. The tracking-by-detection scheme necessarily has to resolve a problem of data association between existing tracks and newly received detections at each frame. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network (DNN) architecture that can solve the data association problem with a variable number of both tracks and detections including false positives. The proposed network consists of two parts: encoder and decoder. The encoder is the fully connected network with several layers that take bounding boxes of both detection and track-history as inputs. The outputs of the encoder are sequentially fed into the decoder which is composed of the bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a projection layer. The final output of the proposed network is an association matrix that reflects matching scores between tracks and detections. To train the network, we generate training samples using the annotation of Stanford Drone Dataset (SDD). The experiment results show that the proposed network achieves considerably high recall and precision rate as the binary classifier for the assignment tasks. We apply our network to track multiple objects on real-world datasets and evaluate the tracking performance. The performance of our tracker outperforms previous works based on DNN and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods.",Drone,2019
Attention and Anticipation in Fast Visual-Inertial Navigation,"We study a visual-inertial navigation (VIN) problem in which a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an inertial sensor, without any prior knowledge of the external environment. We consider the case in which the robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to tight computational constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance of VIN? Our approach has four key ingredients. First, it is task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric quantifying the VIN performance. Second, it exploits the notion of anticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot dynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a future time horizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a greedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues. Fourth, it provides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that the greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection. Simulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach ensures state-of-the-art VIN performance while maintaining a lean processing time. In the easy scenarios, our approach outperforms appearance-based feature selection in terms of localization errors. In the most challenging scenarios, it enables accurate VIN while appearance-based feature selection fails to track robot's motion during aggressive maneuvers.",Drone,2019
Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation for UAV-Enabled Full-Duplex Relay,"This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled full-duplex relaying system. By assuming that the UAV follows a circular trajectory and applies decode-and-forward relaying strategy, we study the joint design of beamforming and power allocation to maximize the instantaneous data rate, under both the individual and the sum power constraints over the source and relay nodes. As the problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient sub-optimal solution based on block-coordinate descent method by decomposing the problem into two sub-problems: a beamforming optimization sub-problem with given power allocation and a power allocation sub-problem with fixed beamforming. For the beamforming design sub-problem, the optimal solution is obtained based on the semi-definite relaxation technique. For the power allocation sub-problem, the optimal solution is obtained in closed form. Then, the closed-form cumulative distribution function and outage probability expressions for sub-optimal beamforming with both uniform power allocation and optimal power allocation are derived. In addition, simple and informative high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations for outage probability expressions are presented to gain insights. Finally, the optimal flying altitude that minimizes the average outage probability is obtained via one-dimensional search.",Drone,2019
Beam Management and Self-Healing for mmWave UAV Mesh Networks,"The point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication features in the IEEE 802.11ay make it possible for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to form a UAV mesh network (flyMesh). In an 802.11ay based millimeter-wave (mmWave) flyMesh, many challenges are brought by the collaborative interactions of UAVs and the beam misalignment of the directional communication links. This paper studies how to guarantee the robustness of the mmWave flyMesh with respect to beam management and network self-healing. First, to cope with the problem of beam misalignment between UAVs or between the UAV group leader and relay base station/satellite caused by the movement of UAV(s), we propose a fast beam tracking mechanism. Second, in order to solve the problem of link failures due to departures of some UAVs from the group or failures, the self-healing mechanism is proposed to find alternative links to restore the network capability. Finally, to deal with the dynamic group leader changes of UAVs due to mobility, we propose an efficient UAV group leader re-selection mechanism to reduce the overhead of UAV group management. Through performance analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms can effectively address the aforementioned problems and challenges.",Drone,2019
LTE GROUND-TO-AIR FIELD MEASUREMENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF FLYING RELAYS,"As future mobile networks move rapidly to 5G, ubiquitous network coverage (even in remote areas), temporary capacity enhancement, and network failure backup are still open issues. The recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles technology have turned the attention of researchers and the industry toward utilizing flying nodes in 5G cellular. One or more UAVs could act as flying network nodes, extending the network coverage or enhancing system capacity, on demand, fast, accurately, and, most important, at low cost. This article presents field measurements, taken with a UAV connected to the existing LTE network of a mid-sized town, and analyzes the data. The goal of the measurement campaign is to monitor the LTE signals in a range of different altitudes under real-life conditions. Results show that at 60 m to 100 m above ground, the LTE coverage probability climbs to 90 percent and the received power gains similar to 18 dB with respect to the ground level. On the other hand, the SIR tends to drop at higher altitudes, but the reduction is limited to 1-2 dB, avoiding the risk of service outage.",Drone,2019
In-flight RCS measurements of drones and birds at K-band and W-band,"This study presents the in-flight radar cross-section (RCS) data of drones and birds at K-band and W-band obtained from extensive experimental trials. The focus of this study is to demonstrate the RCS characteristics of these targets in practical scenarios, hence experimental results are used exclusively. Owing to variations in orientation, aspect angle and target motion, the measured RCS values of these targets fluctuate significantly during their flight. Three very well-calibrated frequency modulated continuous wave radar systems, one operating at the K-band (24 GHz) and two at W-band (94 GHz), have been used to collect data for RCS analysis. Three drones of different sizes (DJI Phantom 3 Standard, DJI Inspire 1 and DJI S900 Hexacopter) and four birds of prey of different sizes (Northern Hawk Owl, Harris Hawk, Indian Eagle Owl and Tawny Eagle) have been used for data collection. The results demonstrate that the RCS scales broadly with the size of the target, consistent with the optical scattering regime and that the RCS values for each target are comparable at the K-band and the W-band. The statistical distribution of RCS for each target falls within a certain range which is useful for predicting the performance of a drone detection radar.",Drone,2019
Adaptive time-varying formation tracking control of unmanned aerial vehicles with quantized input,"This paper considers the adaptive time-varying formation tracking control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with quantized input. Uncertainties and nonholonomic constraint are involved in the UAV model. With a novel transformation of the final control signal, a very coarse quantization can be achieved. Adaptive quantized controllers are proposed by employing backstepping technique. It is proved that, with our proposed strategy, all signals of the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded, and the formation tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small residual set. Simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISA.",Drone,2019
Maximum coverage capacitated facility location problem with range constrained drones,"Given a set of demand and potential facility locations and a set of fully available charged drones, an agency seeks to locate a pre-specified number of capacitated facilities and assign drones to the located facilities to serve the demands. The facilities serve as drone launching sites for distributing the resources. Each drone makes several one-to-one trips from the facility location to the demand points and back until the battery range is met. The planning period is short-term and therefore the recharging of drone batteries is not considered. This paper presents an integer linear programming formulation with the objective of maximizing coverage while explicitly incorporating the drone energy consumption and range constraints. The new formulation is called the Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones or simply MCFLPD. The MCFLPD is a complex problem and even for relatively small problem sizes a state of the art MIP solver may require unacceptably long running times to find feasible solutions. Computational efficiency of MCFLPD solutions is a key factor since conditions associated with customer demands or weather conditions (e.g., wind direction and speed) may change suddenly and require a fast global reoptimization. To better balance solution quality and running times novel greedy and three-stage heuristics (3SH) are developed. The 3SH is based on decomposition and local exchange principles and involves a facility location and allocation problem, multiple knapsack subproblems, and a final local random search stage. On average the 3SH solutions are within 5% of the best Gurobi solutions but at a small fraction of the running time. Multiple scenarios are run to highlight the importance of changes in drone battery capabilities on coverage.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Dense Monocular SLAM With Online Adapted Depth Prediction Network,"Considerable advances have been achieved in estimating the depth map from a single image via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during the past few years. Combining depth prediction from CNNs with conventional monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is promising for accurate and dense monocular reconstruction, in particular addressing the two long-standing challenges in conventional monocular SLAM: low map completeness and scale ambiguity. However, depth estimated by pretrained CNNs usually fails to achieve sufficient accuracy for environments of different types from the training data, which are common for certain applications such as obstacle avoidance of drones in unknown scenes. Additionally, inaccurate depth prediction of CNN could yield large tracking errors in monocular SLAM. In this paper, we present a real-time dense monocular SLAM system, which effectively fuses direct monocular SLAM with an online-adapted depth prediction network for achieving accurate depth prediction of scenes of different types from the training data and providing absolute scale information for tracking and mapping. Specifically, on one hand, tracking pose (i.e., translation and rotation) from direct SLAM is used for selecting a small set of highly effective and reliable training images, which acts as ground truth for tuning the depth prediction network on-the-fly toward better generalization ability for scenes of different types. A stage-wise Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm with a selective update strategy is introduced for efficient convergence of the tuning process. On the other hand, the dense map produced by the adapted network is applied to address scale ambiguity of direct monocular SLAM which in turn improves the accuracy of both tracking and overall reconstruction. The system with assistance of both CPUs and GPUs, can achieve real-time performance with progressively improved reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on public datasets and live application to obstacle avoidance of drones demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with greater map completeness and accuracy, and a smaller tracking error.",Drone,2019
A unified framework for operational range estimation of mobile robots operating on a single discharge to avoid complete immobilization,"Mobile robots are being increasingly deployed in fields where human intervention is deemed risky. However, in doing so, one of the prime concern is to prevent complete battery depletion which may in turn lead to immobilization of the robot during the mission. Thus, we need to carefully manage the energy available to explore as much of the unknown environment as feasible whilst guaranteeing a safe return journey to home base. For this, we need to identify the key components that draw energy and quantify their individual energy requirements. However, this problem is difficult due to the fact that most of the robots have different motion models, and the energy consumption usually also varies from mission to mission. It is desirable to have a generic framework that takes into account different locomotion models and possible mission profiles. This paper presents a methodology to unify the energy consumption models for various robotic platforms thereby allowing us to estimate operational range in both offline and online fashions. The existing models consider a given mission profile and try to estimate its energy requirements whilst our model considers the energy as a given resource constraint and tries to optimize the mission to be accomplished within these constraints. The proposed unified energy consumption framework is verified by field experiments for micro UGV and multi-rotor UAV test-beds operating under myriad of environmental conditions. The online model estimates operational range with an average accuracy (measured with respect to true range across multiple field trials) of 93.87% while the offline model attains 82.97%.",Drone,2019
A compact and high gain substrate integrated horn array antenna system,"In this paper, a novel compact, lightweight and high gain array antennae system is demonstrated which is based on substrate integrated dielectric filled waveguide concepts. It is a planar design which can be easily fabricated with a common two-layer substrate. The overall goal was to have a high gain so that this array antenna could be potentially used in autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle systems for collision avoidance. An initial model was designed, simulated and fabricated and, upon evaluation, was further modified to achieve a higher performance specification. Additionally, the design can be easily and inexpensively fabricated using standard substrates with a rapid prototyping platform. A two element array resulted in a simulated gain of 9.6 dB with a radiation pattern which had a maximum lobe between a broadside and an end-fire. This was with a low loss substrate such as Rogers RT duroid 5880. For the design, a low dissipation factor material is preferable as it minimizes losses and also increases compactness of the entire antenna array.",Drone,2019
Fuzzy logic based equivalent consumption optimization of a hybrid electric propulsion system for unmanned aerial vehicles,"This paper presents an energy management strategy for a hybrid electric propulsion system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed method combines the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) and fuzzy logic control, thereby being named Fuzzy based ECMS (F-ECMS). F-ECMS can solve the issue that the conventional ECMS cannot sustain the battery state-of-charge for on-line applications. Furthermore, F-ECMS considers the aircraft safety and guarantees the aircraft landing using the remaining electrical energy if the engine fails. The main contribution of the paper is to solve the deficiencies of ECMS and take into consideration the aircraft safely landing, by implementing F-ECMS. Compared with the combustion propulsion system, the hybrid propulsion system with F-ECMS at least reduces 11% fuel consumption for designed flight missions. The advantages of F-ECMS are further investigated by comparison with the conventional ECMS, dynamic programming and adaptive ECMS. In contrast with ECMS and dynamic programming, F-ECMS can accomplish a balance between sustaining the battery state-of-charge and electric energy consumption. F-ECMS is also superior to the adaptive ECMS because there are less fuel consumption and lower computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Optimization and control application of sensor placement in aeroservoelastic of UAV,"In order to suppress aeroservoelastic in high-aspect-ratio flexible UAV, in the present work an advanced sensor placement criterion is developed using Cuckoo search algorithm in combination with an enhanced active control method. The advanced sensor placement criterion basically combines the vibration energy based observability measurement as well as further information on evaluating sensor influence in terms of H-2 norm to balance the low and high frequency modes. By eliminating several nests with worst fitness values in each generation and using self-adaptive feedback scaling factor, the proposed elimination mechanism Cuckoo search (EMCS) algorithm is almost three times faster than the standard one. Subsequently, an enhanced active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) method is proposed for the first time in the active vibration control and wind load alleviation of flexible UAV. It is demonstrated that the enhanced ADRC/PID approach with obtained sensor locations can result in a 45.83% reduction in generalized vibrations energy and about 52.16% reduction in wind load alleviation when compared with designs where the sensor locations are not optimum. Finally, the simulation results show that the optimization algorithm can effectively find the optimal location of sensors. Meanwhile, the suppression of aeroservoelastic can be realized with the utilization of the active control. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Robust trajectory tracking controller for quadrotor helicopter based on a novel composite control scheme,"Robust trajectory tracking problem is dealt with for the under-actuated quadrotor system, which is decomposed into two subsystems, i.e., the inner-loop rotational subsystem perturbed by the time-varying disturbances (e.g., parameter variation, model mismatches, payload changes, wind gusts), and the outer-loop translational subsystem subjected to both the uncertain disturbances and time-varying measurement-delay simultaneously. The novel composite control scheme integrating a nominal controller with robust compensators is hierarchically developed. Composite observers consisting of time-varying disturbance observer (TDO) and time-varying measurement-delay observer (TMO) are incorporated into the nominal backstepping control (NBC) as robust compensators, to compensate for the time-varying uncertainties by estimating the disturbance dynamics and system states. Stability of the closed-loop control system is analytically proved based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii theorem, and the proposed controller theoretically guarantees that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around the origin. Comparative flight performances under different controllers for the quadrotor helicopter, in the presence of uncertain disturbances and time-varying measurement-delay, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller.

A visual/inertial integrated landing guidance method for UAV landing on the ship,"This paper presents a visual/inertial integrated guidance method for UAV shipboard landing. The airborne vision system is utilized to track infrared cooperated targets on the ship and output their center coordinates in the image. Meanwhile, the attitude information of the UAV is obtained from airborne Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is chosen to fuse the visual and inertial information. The UAV's position, attitude, and velocity relative to the runway and the ship motion information are estimated. The ship motion information is utilized to predict the position of the intended landing point at the touchdown moment through the Autoregressive algorithm. And the motion information of the UAV is used to calculate the deviation from the intended landing path. All the information is delivered to the flight control system to calculate control command. Simulation shows that the visual/inertial integrated landing guidance system achieves satisfied estimation and prediction results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Improvement of photogrammetric accuracy by modeling and correcting the thermal effect on camera calibration,"This paper presents a new method for improving the geometric accuracy of photogrammetric reconstruction by modeling and correcting the thermal effect on camera image sensor. The objective is to verify that when the temperature of image sensor varies during the acquisition, image deformation induced by the temperature change is quantifiable, modelisable and correctable. A temperature sensor integrated in the camera enables the measurement of image sensor temperature at exposure. It is therefore natural and appropriate to take this effect into account and to finally model and correct it after a calibration step. Nowadays, in cartography applications performed with UAV, the frame rate of acquisitions is continuously increasing. A high frame rate over a long acquisition time can result in an important temperature increase of the image sensor and thus introduces image deformations. The correction of the above-mentioned effect can improve the measurement accuracy. We present three methods to calibrate the thermal effect and experiments on two datasets are carried out to verify the improvement in terms of the photogrammetric accuracy.",Drone,2019
Secure probabilistic caching in random multi-user multi-UAV relay networks,"In this paper, we investigate the system model of random multi-user multi-UAV relay networks, where the transmission can be overheard by multiple eavesdroppers. We consider the random networks where the users, UAV relays and eavesdroppers arrive at the network subject to the homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). Cache is equipped at UAV relays and users, and can pre-storage part of contents, which can help reduce the information leakage. Hence, it is of vital importance to design an effective secure probabilistic caching strategy to ensure the security of content transmission by combining the cache strategy and the physical-layer security in the presence of eavesdroppers. To this end, we first design the caching placement at users and UAV relays by taking into account four transmission schemes. We then analyze the secure performance of the caching placement by analyzing the expression of secure cache throughput. To maximize the secure cache throughput, we further optimize the probabilistic caching strategy by using the heuristic algorithm. Numerical results and discussion are provided to demonstrate that the proposed probabilistic caching strategy outperforms the conventional most popular content (MPC) and equal probability content (EPC) cache strategies, and the system secure performance can be improved by increasing the cache size and the intensity of UAV relays and users.

Successive DSPE-based coherently distributed sources parameters estimation for unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with antennas array,"In electronic countermeasures and reconnaissance, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has played a more and more significant role. Usually when UAV conducts low altitude reconnaissance, due to the complicated environment, the reflected signals of the same source through different propagation paths will produce multipath signals. In this paper, we construct the received multipath signals of UAV with antennas array as coherently distributed (CD) sources model and propose a successive distributed signal parameter estimation (S-DSPE) algorithm to estimate its nominal direction of arrival (DOA) and angular spread. The proposed algorithm simplifies two-dimensional (2D) spectral peak searching within the conventional DSPE algorithm to one-dimensional spectral peak searching, which remarkably reduces the computational complexity of conventional DSPE algorithm. Furthermore, the parameters estimation performance of the proposed algorithm is close to the conventional DSPE algorithm, and outperforms the estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPIRT) algorithm and propagator method (PM). The simulations results verify the usefulness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019

The impacts of the system parameters such as the outdated coefficient, the transmission SNR, the relays' number and the average channel gain are evaluated by the exact analytical expressions as well as the asymptotic results on the outage probability. Based on the asymptotic expressions, we find that the diversity order of the system remains one, regardless of the relays' number and the average channel gain. Simulation results are provided to confirm the theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019

Cooperative moving path following for multiple fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles with speed constraints,"This paper is to address a cooperative moving path following (CMPF) problem, in which a fleet of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are required to converge to and follow a desired geometric moving path while satisfying prespecified speed and spatial constraints. A representative application of the CMPF problem is the challenging mission scenario where a group of UAVs are tasked to track a moving ground target. The proposed methodology is based on the insight that a vehicle can follow a given path only through attitude control, thus leaving its speed as an extra input to be used at the coordination level. To deal with moving path following (MPF) of a single UAV, a non-singular control law is derived to steer the vehicle along the desired moving path which avoids the singularity problem in the previous MPF strategy. For multi-UAV coordination, a pursuit strategy is employed with the introduction of a virtual leader. To account for speed constraints and collision avoidance, conditions are derived under which the combined MPF and multi-UAV coordination closed-loop system is asymptotically stable while speed and spatial constraints are satisfied. Further simulation has been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Detection and mitigation of actuator attacks on small unmanned aircraft systems,"Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) are susceptible to malicious attacks originated by intelligent adversaries, and the actuators constitute one of the critical attack surfaces. In this paper, the problem of detecting and mitigating attacks on the actuators of a small UAS is addressed. Three possible solutions of differing complexity and effectiveness are proposed to address the problem. The first method involves an active detection strategy, whereby carefully designed excitation signals are superimposed on the control commands to increase the detectability of the attack. In the second method, an unknown input observer is designed, which in addition to detecting the attack also estimates the magnitude of the attack. The third method entails designing an actuator system that makes use of variable frequency pulse-width modulated signals to improve the resilience of the actuator against malicious attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated using flight experiments and realistic MATLAB simulations that incorporate exogenous disturbances, such as steady winds, atmospheric turbulence, and measurement noise.",Drone,2019
Weighted strategies to guide a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for multi-UAV mission planning,"Management and mission planning over a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remains to date as a challenging research trend in what regards to this particular type of aircrafts. These vehicles are controlled by a number of ground control station (GCS), from which they are commanded to cooperatively perform different tasks in specific geographic areas of interest. Mathematically the problem of coordinating and assigning tasks to a swarm of UAV can be modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem, whose complexity and multiple conflicting criteria has hitherto motivated the adoption of multi-objective solvers such as multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The encoding approach consists of different alleles representing the decision variables, whereas the fitness function checks that all constraints are fulfilled, minimizing the optimization criteria of the problem. In problems of high complexity involving several tasks, UAV and GCS, where the space of search is huge compared to the space of valid solutions, the convergence rate of the algorithm increases significantly. To overcome this issue, this work proposes a weighted random generator for the creation and mutation of new individuals. The main objective of this work is to reduce the convergence rate of the MOEA solver for multi-UAV mission planning using weighted random strategies that focus the search on potentially better regions of the solution space. Extensive experimental results over a diverse range of scenarios evince the benefits of the proposed approach, which notably improves this convergence rate with respect to a naive MOEA approach.",Drone,2019
Non-Iterative MDS Method for Collaborative Network Localization With Sparse Range and Pointing Measurements,"Multi-agent localization is a basic requirement for many networked applications. The particular application to swarming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or munitions requires spatial coordination of agents, including the ability to assume and maintain a prescribed flight formation. An in-flight awareness of network morphology and node location is therefore needed. While global navigation satellite systems offer an attractive solution, signal occlusion, spoofing, and jamming present unacceptable vulnerabilities-particularly for mission-critical operations. Alternative network localization methods using inter-agent radio frequency ranging and Angle of Arrival have been well studied over the past 15 years, but existing algorithms are not well suited to fast-moving networks. Iterative methods tend to converge slowly. Faster noniterative multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods for range, bearing, or vector measurements have also been formulated. However, these MDS methods generally require the full pairwise inter-agent measurement matrix-placing a severe requirement on swarm connectivity and leading to low tolerance for missing or badly estimated measurements. Even vector-based MDS, which incorporates both range and direction constraints, is shown here to require 4-vertex connectivity to achieve perfect localization. Results from rigidity theory, however, suggest that a lower connectivity threshold should be sufficient to guarantee a unique configuration (up to translation and rotation). In contrast, our proposed ""vertex resequencing"" and ""edge resequencing"" techniques further lower the vertex-connectivity threshold to 3 and 2, respectively. These localization techniques, which extend vector-based MDS with Nystrom approximation, prescribe a graph-based kernel sampling scheme and weighted coordinate reconstruction that suppress the effect of missing measurements.",Drone,2019
"Tactile, Visual, and Crossmodal Visual-Tactile Change Blindness: The Effect of Transient Type and Task Demands","Objective: The present study examined whether tactile change blindness and crossmodal visual-tactile change blindness occur in the presence of two transient types and whether their incidence is affected by the addition of a concurrent task. Background: Multimodal and tactile displays have been proposed as a promising means to overcome data overload and support attention management. To ensure the effectiveness of these displays, researchers must examine possible limitations of human information processing, such as tactile and crossmodal change blindness. Method: Twenty participants performed a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring task that included visual and tactile cues. They completed four blocks of 70 trials each, one involving visual transients, the other tactile transients. A search task was added to determine whether increased workload leads to a higher risk of change blindness. Results: The findings confirm that tactile change detection suffers in terms of response accuracy, sensitivity, and response bias in the presence of a tactile transient. Crossmodal visual-tactile change blindness was not observed. Also, change detection was not affected by the addition of the search task and helped reduce response bias. Conclusion: Tactile displays can help support multitasking and attention management, but their design needs to account for tactile change blindness. Simultaneous presentation of multiple tactile indications should be avoided as it adversely affects change detection. Application: The findings from this research will help inform the design of multimodal and tactile interfaces in data-rich domains, such as military operations, aviation, and healthcare.",Drone,2019
Integral backstepping control for trajectory and yaw motion tracking of quadrotors,"This work presents a novel trajectory tracking, hovering, and yaw motion control for quadrotors subject to unknown modeling uncertainties and disturbances. Nonlinear equations of motion are used to model the quadrotor's motion without any simplifying assumptions. An integral backstepping control is developed by defining the tracking errors, their integral, and their first through third time derivatives as the system states. The resulting surge force and roll and pitch moments are shown to asymptotically stabilize the error states subject to bounded disturbances and modeling uncertainties. Similarly, a yaw moment is derived through integral backstepping that simultaneously stabilizes yaw motion errors. The controller performance in simultaneous trajectory and yaw motion tracking is verified through both simulations and experiments.",Drone,2019
The proliferation of peripheries: Militarized drones and the reconfiguration of global space,"By situating drones in a lineage of colonial technologies of pacification, the critical literature on militarized drones suggests a revised concept of peripheries and global space. This paper engages this literature to argue for a conception of peripheries as spaces of colonial state power at multiple scales. It does so by arguing for a distinction between proliferation to the global periphery and the proliferation of peripheries at multiple scales and across scattered sites. The paper also draws on Gramsci and Fanon to elaborate an internationalist anticolonial position on the defense of territorial sovereignty of states in the global periphery.",Drone,2019
Continuous Sliding-Mode Control Strategies for Quadrotor Robust Tracking: Real-Time Application,"The design of robust tracking control for quadrotors is an important and challenging problem nowadays. In this paper, a robust tracking output-control strategy is proposed for a quadrotor under the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties. Such a strategy is composed of a finite-time sliding-mode observer, which estimates the full state from the measurable output and identifies some types of disturbances. It is also composed of a combination of PID controllers and continuous sliding-modes controllers that robustly track a desired time-varying trajectory with exponential convergence despite the influence of external disturbances and uncertainties. The closed-loop stability is provided based on the input-to-state stability (ISS) and finite-time ISS properties. Finally, experimental results in real time show the performance of the proposed control strategy.",Drone,2019
Xerox Day Vulnerability,"In the area of espionage between countries, an infiltration covert channel used to trigger a silent malware installed on a network of a critical organization (such as 911 services and missile launching facility) from the outside world is extremely dangerous to the target country's security. In order to prevent attackers from establishing such a channel, these organizations take various steps to secure their networks, to make the establishment of this type of covert channel very challenging and almost impractical to achieve; the current state of the art methods are very limited and ineffective. In this paper, we show that even a strong isolation technique, such as air-gapping the network, can be circumvented by using an organizational multifunction printer (MFP) to establish an infiltration covert channel in order to communicate with a malware installed on an isolated organization from the outside. We show how an attacker can leverage the light sensitivity of an MFP and use different light sources to infiltrate commands to the malware in the organization. We analyze the influence of light intensity, distance, transmission rate, ambient light, and wavelength on the covert channel. In addition we demonstrate the attack on a real organization using: 1) a laser attached to a tripod stand; 2) a laser carried by a drone; and 3) a hijacked smart bulb that is not even connected to the organization's network and is accessed and controlled by an attacker in a passing car. We prove that locating the scanner in an inner room inside an organization does not prevent an attacker from establishing the covert channel. We show how our covert channel can be established from a greater distance (900 m) and at a higher transmission rate of 200 bits/s than other methods used to infiltrate data to an organization, even using invisible light (covertly).",Drone,2019
Optimal Placement of CRNs in Manned/Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Cooperative Engagement System,"Aiming at the optimal placement of communication relay nodes (OPCRN) problem in manned/unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative engagement system, this paper designed a kind of fully connected broadband backbone communication topology.

Secondly, based on problem analysis, the element attributes and decision variables were defined, and a bi-level programming model including physical layer and logical layer was established. Thirdly, a hierarchical artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm was adopted to solve the model. Finally, multiple sets of simulation experiments were carried out to prove the effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm.",Drone,2019
Reactive obstacle avoidance of monocular quadrotors with online adapted depth prediction network,"Obstacle avoidance based on a monocular camera is a fundamental yet highly challenging task due to the lack of 3D information for a monocular quadrotor. Recent methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [1] for monocular depth estimation and obstacle detection become increasingly popular due to the considerable advances in deep learning. However, depth estimation by pre-trained CNNs usually suffers from large accuracy degradation for scenes of different types from the training data which are common for obstacle avoidance of drones in unknown environments. In this paper, we present a reactive obstacle avoidance system which employs an online adaptive CNN for progressively improving depth estimation from a monocular camera in unfamiliar environments. Pairs of motion stereo images are collected on-the-fly as training data based on a direct monocular SLAM running in parallel with the CNN. Novel approaches are introduced for selecting highly reliable training samples from noisy data provided by SLAM and efficient online CNN tuning. The depth map computed from the CNN is transformed into Ego Dynamic Space (EDS) by embedding both dynamic motion constraints of a quadrotor and depth estimation errors into the spatial depth map. Traversable waypoints with consideration of the camera's field of view constraint are automatically computed in EDS based on which appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter are produced. Experimental results on both public datasets, simulated environments and unseen cluttered indoor environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

"Optimization of Base Location and Patrol Routes for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Border Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance","The location-routing problem (LRP) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in border patrol for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance is investigated, where the locations of UAV base stations and the UAV flying routes for visiting the targets in border area are jointly optimized.

"Ultrathin, lightweight and flexible perovskite solar cells with an excellent power-per-weight performance","Lightweight and flexible photovoltaic devices have attracted great interest for specific potential applications, such as miniaturized drones, blimps, and aerospace electronics. This study aims to demonstrate ultralight and flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with orthogonal silver nanowire (AgNW) transparent electrodes fabricated on 1.3 mu m-thick polyethylene naphthalate foils. The smooth surface morphologies of the orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes help prevent nonconducting silver halide formation generated by chemical reaction between the AgNWs and iodine in the active layer. The resultant PSCs with orthogonal AgNW transparent electrodes exhibit substantially improved device performance, achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.18%, over PSCs with random AgNW network electrodes (10.43% PCE). Moreover, ultralight and flexible PSCs with the orthogonal AgNW electrodes exhibit an excellent power-per-weight of 29.4 W g(-1), which is the highest value reported for a lightweight solar cell device. These lightweight energy harvesting platforms can be further expanded for various wearable optoelectronic devices.",Drone,2019
Remote line scan thermography for the rapid inspection of composite impact damage,"An investigation of the feasibility of inspecting impact damage in polymer composite aircraft components using remote line scan thermography (LST) is presented. A numerical study is undertaken to determine the minimum heat-source beam width required to detect barely visible impact damage (BVID) above a threshold size. It is shown that the beam width requirement can be met with a non-laser-based heating source. A light-weight incandescent focusing-optic luminaire meeting this requirement is designed, developed and experimentally validated. A new image processing strategy for line-scan thermography is introduced. This method, called Dynamic Pulse Phase Thermography (DPPT), does not require static reconstruction of LST data streams and therefore is less restrictive than established processing methods for real-time applications. Experiments on carbon epoxy laminates, one containing flat-bottom-hole defects and another BVID, are used to demonstrate the performance of DPPT compared to Static Pulse Phase Thermography. It is shown that an LST inspection system comprising a light-weight luminaire and a relatively compact low-cost microbolometer, in conjunction with DPPT processing, is able to detect BVID in an aerospace grade carbon-epoxy laminate, at a scan rate of 50 mm/s and a stand-off distance of 500 mm. The significance of this finding for remote LST inspection via an unmanned aerial vehicle is discussed.",Drone,2019
Effect of single and dual-modifications on stability and structural characteristics of foxtail millet starch,"Foxtail millet starch was modified by annealing (AS), ultra-sonication (US) and a combination of the two treatments (annealing and ultra-sonication (AUS) or ultra-sonication and annealing (UAS)) and they were characterized. Compared to the native starch (NS), modified starches particularly UAS contained the highest amylose (27.96%). Ultra-sonication prior to annealing had a predominant effect on resistant starch (RS) level (UAS-45.59%). Among the modified starches, UAS had exhibited superior resistance to acidic (0.94) and shear (0.68) stability. Sonication, when used as the second treatment (AUS) elevated the final viscosity compared to its counter ones possibly due to the effects of cavitation promoted by sonication treatment. UAS had showed an A type diffraction pattern and dominant peaks in FT-IR spectra. It can be inferred that dual modification of starch by ultra-sonication followed by annealing had exhibited the most desirable properties such as high acid and shear resistance, high freeze-thaw stability and improved gel texture.",Drone,2019
Panoramic shot device of 720-degree VR for hexacopter UAV based on three-axis gimbal,"A new structure and an improved control method of the three-axis gimbal for hexacopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are presented. By optimising the structure of the three-axis gimbal and establishing the mathematical model with the maximum stability, the improved structure of three-axis gimbal is proposed, which two groups of virtual reality (VR) camera arrays are mounted on the top and bottom of the frame to meet requirements of the 720-degree panoramic shot. The redundant design of five motors in the structure could realise the stabilisation of three-axis linkage of the gimbal that will ensure the optimal performance of the independent stable cameras all the time. At the same time, the attitude of the gimbal could be controlled by the complementary filter and proportional, integral and derivative algorithms. Furthermore, the closed-loop controls of angle, speed and current of Brushless DC motor are realised by the non-contact magnetic encoder, which improves the anti-shake performance of the system. The experiments in the prototype are designed to prove the anti-shake performance of the proposed gimbal and stability of the hexacopter UAV.",Drone,2019
A monocular vision-based perception approach for unmanned aerial vehicle close proximity transmission tower inspection,"Employing unmanned aerial vehicles to conduct close proximity inspection of transmission tower is becoming increasingly common. This article aims to solve the two key problems of close proximity navigation-localizing tower and simultaneously estimating the unmanned aerial vehicle positions. To this end, we propose a novel monocular vision-based environmental perception approach and implement it in a hierarchical embedded unmanned aerial vehicle system. The proposed framework comprises tower localization and an improved point-line-based simultaneous localization and mapping framework consisting of feature matching, frame tracking, local mapping, loop closure, and nonlinear optimization. To enhance frame association, the prominent line feature of tower is heuristically extracted and matched followed by the intersections of lines are processed as the point feature. Then, the bundle adjustment optimization leverages the intersections of lines and the point-to-line distance to improve the accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle localization. For tower localization, a transmission tower data set is created and a concise deep learning-based neural network is designed to perform real-time and accurate tower detection. Then, it is in combination with a keyframe-based semi-dense mapping to locate the tower with a clear line-shaped structure in 3-D space. Additionally, two reasonable paths are planned for the refined inspection. In experiments, the whole unmanned aerial vehicle system developed on Robot Operating System framework is evaluated along the paths both in a synthetic scene and in a real-world inspection environment. The final results show that the accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle localization is improved, and the tower reconstruction is fast and clear. Based on our approach, the safe and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle close proximity inspection of transmission tower can be realized.",Drone,2019
A Framework for Analyzing Fog-Cloud Computing Cooperation Applied to Information Processing of UAVs,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a relatively new technology. Their application can often involve complex and unseen problems. For instance, they can work in a cooperative-based environment under the supervision of a ground station to speed up critical decision-making processes. However, the amount of information exchanged among the aircraft and ground station is limited by high distances, low bandwidth size, restricted processing capability, and energy constraints. These drawbacks restrain large-scale operations such as large area inspections. New distributed state-of-the-art processing architectures, such as fog computing, can improve latency, scalability, and efficiency to meet time constraints via data acquisition, processing, and storage at different levels. Under these amendments, this research work proposes a mathematical model to analyze distribution-based UAVs topologies and a fog-cloud computing framework for large-scale mission and search operations. The tests have successfully predicted latency and other operational constraints, allowing the analysis of fog-computing advantages over traditional cloud-computing architectures.",Drone,2019
"Predatory War, Drones and Torture: Remapping the Body in Pain","Elaine Scarry argues in The Body in Pain that war is a vast and reciprocal swearing on the body, with corporeality key not only to its brutal prosecution but also to the eventual ending of the political 'crisis of substantiation' that war entails. However, her work has not been extensively explored with reference to significant transformations in the embodied experiences of contemporary warfare. This article thus analyses a particular articulation of late modern warfare that I term predatory war, whose current signature motif is the drone strike, through the lens of Scarry's work. Here, the associated modes of embodiment are radically non-reciprocal, the woundscapes of conflict are profoundly asymmetric, and the affective mediation of bodily injury does not substantiate any ending to the conflict. As such, I argue that the ontology and phenomenology of predatory war increasingly resembles what Scarry identifies as the underlying structure of torture.",Drone,2019
An Improved Unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection Algorithm Using Radiofrequency-Based Statistical Fingerprint Analysis,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now readily available worldwide and users can easily fly them remotely using smart controllers. This has created the problem of keeping unauthorized UAVs away from private or sensitive areas where they can be a personal or public threat. This paper proposes an improved radio frequency (RF)-based method to detect UAVs. The clutter (interference) is eliminated using a background filtering method. Then singular value decomposition (SVD) and average filtering are used to reduce the noise and improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Spectrum accumulation (SA) and statistical fingerprint analysis (SFA) are employed to provide two frequency estimates. These estimates are used to determine if a UAV is present in the detection environment. The data size is reduced using a region of interest (ROI), and this improves the system efficiency and improves azimuth estimation accuracy. Detection results are obtained using real UAV RF signals obtained experimentally which show that the proposed method is more effective than other well-known detection algorithms. The recognition rate with this method is close to 100% within a distance of 2.4 km and greater than 90% within a distance of 3 km. Further, multiple UAVs can be detected accurately using the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Numerical and Experimental Estimation of the Efficiency of a Quadcopter Rotor Operating at Hover,"Globalization has led to an increase in the use of small copters for different activities such as geo-referencing, agricultural fields monitoring, survillance, among others. This is the main reason why there is a strong interest in the performance of small-scale propellers used in unmanned aerial vehicles. The flow developed by rotors is complex and the estimation of its aerodynamic performance is not a trivial process. In addition, viscous effects, when the rotor operates at low Reynolds, affect its performance. In the present paper, two different computational methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (UVLM) with a viscous correction, were used to study the performance of an isolated rotor of a quadcopter flying at hover. The Multi Reference Frame model and transition <mml:semantics>SST</mml:semantics> <mml:semantics>-</mml:semantics> turbulence model were used in the CFD simulations. The tip vortex core growth was used to account for the viscous effects in the UVLM. The wake structure, pressure coefficient, thrust and torque predictions from both methods are compared. Thrust and torque results from simulations were validated by means of experimental results of a characterization of a single rotor. Finally, figure of merit of the rotor is evaluated showing that UVLM overestimates the efficiency of the rotor; meanwhile, CFD predictions are close to experimental values.",Drone,2019
Preflight Contingency Planning Approach for Fixed Wing UAVs with Engine Failure in the Presence of Winds,"Preflight contingency planning that utilizes wind forecast in path planning can be highly beneficial to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) operators in preventing a possible mishap of the UAV. This especially becomes more important if the UAV has an engine failure resulting in the loss of all its thrust. Wind becomes a significant factor in determining reachability of the emergency landing site in a contingency like this. The preflight contingency plans can guide the UAV operators about how to glide the aircraft to the designated emergency landing site to make a safe landing. The need for a preflight or in-flight contingency plan is even more obvious in the case of a communication loss between the UAV operator and UAV since the UAV will then need to make the forced landing autonomously without the operator. In this paper, we introduce a preflight contingency planning approach that automates the forced landing path generation process for UAVs with engine failure. The contingency path generation aims true reachability to the emergency landing site by including the final approach part of the path in forecast wind conditions. In the contingency path generation, no-fly zones that could be in the area are accounted for and the contingency flight paths do not pass through them. If no plans can be found that fulfill reachability in the presence of no-fly zones, only then, as a last resort, the no-fly zone avoidance rule is relaxed. The contingency path generation utilizes hourly forecast wind data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for the geographical area of interest and time of the flight. Different from past works, we use trochoidal paths instead of Dubins curves and incorporate wind as a parameter in the contingency path design.",Drone,2019
Distractor-Aware Deep Regression for Visual Tracking,"In recent years, regression trackers have drawn increasing attention in the visual-object tracking community due to their favorable performance and easy implementation. The tracker algorithms directly learn mapping from dense samples around the target object to Gaussian-like soft labels. However, in many real applications, when applied to test data, the extreme imbalanced distribution of training samples usually hinders the robustness and accuracy of regression trackers. In this paper, we propose a novel effective distractor-aware loss function to balance this issue by highlighting the significant domain and by severely penalizing the pure background. In addition, we introduce a full differentiable hierarchy-normalized concatenation connection to exploit abstractions across multiple convolutional layers. Extensive experiments were conducted on five challenging benchmark-tracking datasets, that is, OTB-13, OTB-15, TC-128, UAV-123, and VOT17. The experimental results are promising and show that the proposed tracker performs much better than nearly all the compared state-of-the-art approaches.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Model-Free Minimum-Seeking Autotuning Method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Controllers Based on Fibonacci-Search Algorithm,"The paper presents a novel autotuning approach for finding locally-best parameters of controllers on board of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The controller tuning is performed fully autonomously during flight on the basis of predefined ranges of controller parameters. Required controller properties may be simply interpreted by a cost function, which is involved in the optimization process. For example, the sum of absolute values of the tracking error samples or performance indices, including weighed functions of control signal samples, can be penalized to achieve very precise position control, if required. The proposed method relies on an optimization procedure using Fibonacci-search technique fitted into bootstrap sequences, enabling one to obtain a global minimizer for a unimodal cost function. The approach is characterized by low computational complexity and does not require any UAV dynamics model (just periodical measurements from basic onboard sensors) to obtain proper tuning of a controller. In addition to the theoretical background of the method, an experimental verification in real-world outdoor conditions is provided. The experiments have demonstrated a high robustness of the method to in-environment disturbances, such as wind, and its easy deployability.",Drone,2019
Combined time and energy optimal trajectory planning with quadratic drag for mixed discrete-continuous task planning,"The problem of mixed discrete-continuous task planning for mechanical systems, such as aerial drones or other autonomous units, can be often treated as a sequence of point-to-point trajectories. In this work, the problem of optimal trajectory planning under a combined completion time and energy criterion, for a straight point to point path for a second-order system with quadratic under state (velocity) and control (acceleration) constraints is considered. The solution is obtained and proved to be optimal using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. Simulation results for different cases are presented and compared with a customary numerical optimal control solver.",Drone,2019
Distributed Robust Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Mechanism for Quadrotor UAV Real-Time Wireless Network Systems With Random Delay and Packet Loss,"This research combines a next-generation wireless network and a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to create a real-time wireless network quadrotor UAV flight control system. Three major problems will occur when the system operates, such as external disturbances, internal actuator failures and wireless network association failures (random delay and packet loss). We propose a hierarchical distributed comprehensive robust adaptive fault-tolerant control algorithm based on robust fault-tolerant theory to improve the performance of this system. The simulation and flight experimental test results show that when this system is analyzed with respect to external disturbances, internal actuator failures and wireless network association failures, the designed controller stability is asymptotically stable, the performance of this system is very good and the system provides a strategy for establishing a ground-to-air self-organizing wireless network.",Drone,2019
UAV-Aided Wireless Powered Communication Networks: Trajectory Optimization and Resource Allocation for Minimum Throughput Maximization,"This paper investigates wireless powered communication network (WPCN) systems aided by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) where a UAV-mounted access point (AP) serves multiple energy-constrained ground terminals (GTs). Specifically, the UAVs first transmit the wireless energy transfer (WET) signals to charge the GTs in the downlink. Then, by utilizing the harvested energy, the GTs send their wireless information transmission (WIT) signals to the UAVs in the uplink. In this paper, depending on the operations of the UAVs, we consider two different scenarios, namely integrated and separated UAV WPCNs. First, in the integrated system, a UAV acts as a hybrid AP in which both energy transfer and information reception are performed at a single UAV. In contrast, for the separated UAV WPCN, we consider two UAVs each of which behaves as an information AP and an energy AP independently, and thus the information decoding and the energy transfer are separately processed at two different UAVs. In each system, we formulate two optimization problems taking into account a linear energy harvesting (EH) model and a practical non-linear model. To maximize the minimum throughput of the GTs, we jointly optimize the trajectories of the UAVs, the uplink power control, and the time resource allocation for the WET and the WIT. Since the formulated problems are non-convex, in the linear EH model-based system, we apply the concave-convex procedure by deriving appropriate convex bounds for non-convex constraints and identify the suboptimal solution for the problem by a proposed iterative algorithm. In the non-linear model-based system, we propose another algorithm to obtain an efficient solution by adopting the successive convex approximation method with the alternating optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and the performance of the proposed algorithms compared to conventional schemes.",Drone,2019
Anti-Jamming Communications in UAV Swarms: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm may accomplish complex tasks through cooperation, relying on inter-UAV communications. This paper aims to improve the communication performance of intelligent UAV swarm system in the presence of jamming, by multi-parameter programming and reinforcement learning. This paper considers a communication system, where the communication between a UAV swarm and the base station is jammed by multiple interferers. Compared with the existing work, the UAVs in the system can exploit degree-of-freedom in frequency, motion and antenna spatial domain to optimize the communication quality in the receiving area. This paper proposes a modified Q-Learning algorithm based on multi-parameter programming, where a cost is introduced to strike a balance between the motion and communication performance of the UAVs. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm.",Drone,2019
Distributed Adaptive Control for UAV Formation With Input Saturation and Actuator Fault,"The distributed adaptive tracking control schemes are addressed to deal with the formation control problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles subject to input saturation, actuator fault, and external disturbance. First, a novel adaptive backstepping control approach associated with a command filter is presented to settle the model uncertainty and input saturation problems. Second, a robust fault-tolerant controller is introduced to tackle the case with external disturbance, actuator fault, and model uncertainty by estimating the upper bounds of the faults and external disturbances. In addition, the proposed controllers enable the asymptotical stability of the closed-loop system in case of undirected interaction graph. Finally, the numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approaches are effective for the unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) formation system with various constraints.",Drone,2019
Multi-Agent Fault-Tolerant Control Based on Distributed Adaptive Consensus,"This paper proposes a distributed adaptive control approach based on consensus theory so that a multi-agent formation can still complete the task despite the local fault of the leader for the multi-agent formation system. The controlled object consists of four agents that form a triangle formation system, where one agent acts as the vertex of the triangle, and the remaining agents act as followers in a line. In addition, the speed of the leader is the forward direction of the formation, and the followers are behind the leader. Based on graph theory, the distributed adaptive updating of the agents local information parameters are conducted, and the distributed adaptive control law is used to supplement the influence of the leaders fault in the multi-agent formation. According to the local information of adjacent agents, an overall distributed adaptive fault-tolerant control law is designed, and the stability of the designed controller is proved by constructing the Lyapunov function. Meanwhile, the relative distance error between the horizontal direction and longitudinal direction of the leader-follower converge to zero. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive control approach has good robustness, which provides a theoretical basis for engineering practice.",Drone,2019
Optimal Sensor Deployment and Velocity Configuration With Hybrid TDOA and FDOA Measurements,"Source localization based on the hybrid time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency- difference-of-arrival (FDOA) measurements from distributed sensors is an essential problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we mainly study the optimal sensor deployment and velocity configuration of UAV swarms mounted with TDOA and FDOA based sensors. Explicit solutions of optimal sensor deployment and velocity configuration are acquired in both static and movable source scenarios based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Both centralized and decentralized localization are explored to meet different types of localization methods. Path planning problem of UAV swarms in TDOA/FDOA localization is also studied with constraints. Simulations verify its efficiency with path planning in TDOA and FDOA localization.",Drone,2019
Study of Fuel-Controlled Aircraft Engine for Fuel-Powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Energy Conversion Analysis and Optimization,"Recently, the cruising duration is a vital parameter of fuel-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and it is directly determined by the power characteristics of the aircraft engine in the UAV. In this study, to prolong the flight duration and enhance the power and efficiency of a UAV, an aircraft engine is analyzed based on the fuel injection control system and output power characteristics. First, the mathematical model of a fuel-controlled engine is constructed. In addition, the experimental stations of the aircraft engine are set up to verify the mathematical model. Furthermore, the effects of key parameters on the engine power characteristics are examined. By the experimental and simulation studies validity of the mathematical model is effectively verified which indicates that the increased rotating speed decreases the power efficiency of the aircraft engine, and reducing the fuel injection pulse width from 5 ms to 3.5 ms increases the power efficiency by 10%. Moreover, increasing the advance angle of ignition from 10 degrees to 40 degrees improves the power efficiency by 5%. In addition, when the fuel injection delay width increases from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm at an engine speed between 3500 rpm and 4000 rpm, the power efficiency is improved by 6%. Finally, when the engine speed is higher than 4000 rpm, increasing the propeller rotor diameter from 650 mm to 800 mm enhances the power efficiency of the aircraft engine by approximately 5%. This research can be considered as the fuel injection system optimization and cruising duration improvement of a fuel-powered UAV.",Drone,2019
A New Searching Approach Using Improved Multi-Ant Colony Scheme for Multi-UAVs in Unknown Environments,"In this research, an important topic of cooperative search for multi-dynamic targets in unknown sea area by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is studied based on improved multi-ant colony theory (IMAC). A specialized multi-UAV sea area search map is established, in which a novel target probability map (TPM) was designed to reduce the impact of uncertainties caused by dynamics targets. Then, the transfer rules of the cell were determined for multi-UAV by improving the behavior criterion of the ant colony algorithm and the updating principle of the pheromone map. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is tested in several search scenarios with different features, and the statistical comparison with the traditional algorithm shows the superiority of the new method.",Drone,2019
Efficient Training Techniques for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Combat Tasks,"Multi-agent combat scenarios often appear in many real-time strategy games. Efficient learning for such scenarios is an indispensable step towards general artificial intelligence. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have attracted much interests, but few of them have been shown effective for such scenarios. Most of previous research is focused on revising the learning mechanism of MARL algorithms, for example, trying different types of neural networks. The study of training techniques for improving the performance of MARL algorithms has not been paid much attention. In this paper we propose three efficient training techniques for a multi-agent combat problem which is originated from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) combat scenario. The first one is the scenario-transfer training, which utilizes the experience obtained in simpler combat tasks to assist the training for complex tasks. The next one is the self-play training, which can continuously improve the performance by iteratively training agents and their counterparts. Finally, we consider using combat rules to assist the training, which is named as the rule-coupled training. We combine the three training techniques with two popular multi-agent reinforcement learning methods, multi-agent deep q-learning and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (proposed by Open AI in 2017), respectively. The results show that both the converging speed and the performance of the two methods are significantly improved through the three training techniques.",Drone,2019
Machine Learning-Based Drone Detection and Classification: State-of-the-Art in Research,"This paper presents a comprehensive review of current literature on drone detection and classification using machine learning with different modalities. This research area has emerged in the last few years due to the rapid development of commercial and recreational drones and the associated risk to airspace safety. Addressed technologies encompass radar, visual, acoustic, and radio-frequency sensing systems. The general finding of this study demonstrates that machine learning-based classification of drones seems to be promising with many successful individual contributions. However, most of the performed research is experimental and the outcomes from different papers can hardly be compared. A general requirement-driven specification for the problem of drone detection and classification is still missing as well as reference datasets which would help in evaluating different solutions.",Drone,2019
Efficient Lazy Theta Path Planning over a Sparse Grid to Explore Large 3D Volumes with a Multirotor UAV,"Exploring large, unknown, and unstructured environments is challenging for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), but they are valuable tools to inspect large structures safely and efficiently. The Lazy Theta* path-planning algorithm is revisited and adapted to generate paths fast enough to be used in real time and outdoors in large 3D scenarios. In real unknown scenarios, a given minimum safety distance to the nearest obstacle or unknown space should be observed, increasing the associated obstacle detection queries, and creating a bottleneck in the path-planning algorithm. We have reduced the dimension of the problem by considering geometrical properties to speed up these computations. On the other hand, we have also applied a non-regular grid representation of the world to increase the performance of the path-planning algorithm. In particular, a sparse resolution grid in the form of an octree is used, organizing the measurements spatially, merging voxels when they are of the same state. Additionally, the number of neighbors is trimmed to match the sparse tree to reduce the number of obstacle detection queries. The development methodology adopted was Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the outcome was evaluated in real outdoors flights with a multirotor UAV. In the results, the performance shows over 90 percent decrease in overall path generation computation time. Furthermore, our approach scales well with the safety distance increases.",Drone,2019
Imaging for Small UAV-Borne FMCW SAR,"Unmanned aerial vehicle borne frequency modulated continuous wave synthetic aperture radars are attracting more and more attention due to their low cost and flexible operation capacity, including the ability to capture images at different elevation angles for precise target identification. However, small unmanned aerial vehicles suffer from large trajectory deviation and severe range-azimuth coupling due to their simple navigational control and susceptibility to air turbulence. In this paper, we utilize the squint minimization technique to reduce this coupling while simultaneously eliminating intra-pulse motion-induced effects with an additional spectrum scaling. After which, the modified range doppler algorithm is derived for second order range compression and block-wise range cell migration correction. Raw data-based motion compensation is carried out with a doppler tracker. Squinted azimuth dependent phase gradient algorithm is employed to deal with azimuth dependent parameters and inexact deramping, with minimum entropy-based autofocusing algorithms. Finally, azimuth nonlinear chirp scaling is used for azimuth compression. Simulation and real data experiment results presented verify the effectiveness of the above signal processing approach.",Drone,2019
Sensitivity-Compensated Micro-Pressure Flexible Sensor for Aerospace Vehicle,"When flight vehicles (e.g., aerospace vehicles, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, near-space aircrafts, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and drones) fly at high speed, their surfaces suffer the micro-pressure from high-altitude thin air. The long-term effect of this pressure causes the surface components of flight vehicle to deform or fall off, which can lead to a serious accident. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a sensitivity-compensated micro-pressure flexible sensor based on hyper-elastic plastic material and plate parallel capacitance. The sensor is able to measure a range of 0-6 kPa micro-pressure suffered by the flight vehicle's surface with high sensitivity and flexible devices. In this paper, we propose the principle, structure design and fabrication of the sensitivity-compensated micro-pressure flexible sensor. We carried out experiments to obtain the static characteristic curve between micro-pressure and the output capacitance of the sensor devices, and investigated the relationship between sensitivity and geometric parameters. We also compared the performance of the flexible sensor before and after sensitivity compensation. The result shows that the sensor can measure a range of 0-2 kPa and 2-6 kPa with a sensitivity of 0.27 kPa(-1) and 0.021 kPa(-1), which are 80% and 141.38% higher than the sensor before compensation; a linearity of 1.39% and 2.88%, which are 51.7% and 13.1% higher than the sensor before compensation; and a hysteresis and repeatability of 4.95% and 2.38%, respectively. The sensor has potential applications in flight vehicles to measure the micro-pressure with high sensitivity and flexibility.",Drone,2019
Trajectory Following and Improved Differential Evolution Solution for Rapid Forming of UAV Formation,"In this paper we proposed the circle trajectory assembly algorithm to control the multi-UAVs circular assembly formation. CTFAP solution provides rapid formation of UAVs on a circular orbit and solve the problem of large scattering distance. Proposed Distributed model prediction control framework improves the optimization ability and reduces the computation consumption with the better convergence ability of the UAV formation. Firstly, a circular trajectory following algorithm with an adaptive parameter is proposed to complete the rapid formation of UAVs on a circular orbit and solve the problem of large scattering distance during formation forming. Then, in the stage of formation reconfiguration, with distributed model prediction control framework (DMPC), the proposed method gets the prediction information of DMPC to optimize the population of classical differential evolution (DE) algorithm and improve the iterative optimization ability of DE algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed differential evolution algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of solving the formation reconfiguration problem under the DMPC framework and overcomes the disadvantages of random population of classical DE. For the proposed rapid forming method, assembly range is reduced by 41 compared with direct linearly formation assembly, and the formation forming time is reduced by approximately 21. Compared with other optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA) and DE, the proposed differential evolution algorithm reduces instruction response time of single-drones by 1630.",Drone,2019
A Real-Time Collision Avoidance Strategy in Dynamic Airspace Based on Dynamic Artificial Potential Field Algorithm,"The key to the integration of unmanned aircrafts in the national airspace is to prevent them from colliding with the other traffics in the airspace. However, it is a great challenge to generate a safe, stable and robust collision-free path for unmanned aircraft system (UAS), a.k.a. unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV), in real time, if the airspace is highly dynamics and heterogenous (i.e. thronged with aircrafts with different motion states). Based on the dynamic artificial potential field (DAPF) algorithm, this paper provides advisories on how to generate a real-time reactive collision-free path for unmanned aircraft vehicles flying in a dynamic airspace, aiming to ensure the flight safety and minimize the impact on surrounding traffic. Firstly, the safety distance was defined as a variable threshold, which scaled adaptively according to the relative motion states of the surrounding obstacles and the performance of the own UAV. Moreover, the forces of the potential field were improved, such that their magnitudes could be adjusted automatically according to the threat levels of the surrounding obstacles. The threat level of an obstacle depends on the relative position, speed and flight trend between the UAV and the obstacle. In addition, the repulsive force along the relative position of the traditional artificial potential field (APF) was retained, and a steering force was added to change the flight direction of the UAV, aiming to speed up the collision avoidance. Furthermore, the attractive force was modified to help the UAV return to the planned path quickly and stably. After that, the capacity were determined to ensure the feasible and practical path planning for the UAV. Finally, the proposed UAV path-planning method was proved effective, safe, stable and adaptive through simulations.",Drone,2019
Leader-Following Consensus Control for Multiple Fixed-Wing UAVs Attitude System With Time Delays and External Disturbances,"This paper proposes an algorithm of leader-following consensus control of multiple fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) attitudes with time delays and unknown external disturbances.

Then, the effects of time delays are compensated with the help of Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, Cauchy and Youngs inequality. Secondly, RBF neural network is introduced to estimate and reduce the negative effects of external disturbances. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed distributed controller is demonstrated by Lyapunov theory and simulations.",Drone,2019
Command Filtered Model-Free Robust Control for Aircrafts With Actuator Dynamics,"In this paper, a command filtered model-free robust (CFMFR) controller is proposed to regulate attitude angles of an aircraft with parameter uncertainties and disturbances to track the given reference signals. For the first subsystem of the controlled plant, the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) is applied to design incremental virtual control law. While the time-delayed control (TDC) method is used to design the control law by integrating sliding-mode technique considering the nominal value of the control effectiveness matrix is unknown. The adaption laws of the control gain are constructed by Lyapunov control theorem. Not only the actuator dynamics of the control surfaces are considered, but also the noises, biases, and time delays of the measurements of the control surface deflection angles are taken into account. Therefore, the command-filtered backstepping is utilized to compensate for the actuator dynamics and filtered errors, and the modified stable linear filter is developed to handle the measurement errors. The stability of the whole closed-loop system, including the compensated signals which are the outputs of the stable linear filters, is analyzed by using Lyapunov theory. The numerical simulation results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed CFMFR control approach with updating matrix.",Drone,2019
A Novel Method for Measuring Drogue-UAV Relative Pose in Autonomous Aerial Refueling Based on Monocular Vision,"The key to the docking phase of autonomous aerial refueling missions is the relative pose measurement between the drogue and unmanned aerial vehicles. A novel measurement method for drogue-UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) relative poses based on monocular vision is proposed in this paper. An adaptive arc-level structural feature extraction algorithm is applied to obtain the features that can be used for the measurements. In this algorithm, the projection of the end plane of the drogue in the image plane is accurately extracted based on an extraction quality metric. The projection contour and centroid of the internal black part of the drogue form the structural feature for the measurements. A robust pose estimation algorithm is presented to estimate the relative pose between the drogue and the UAV. The pose can be solved using a cone that is composed of the optical center of the camera and the structural feature. A Kalman filter is then applied to robustly estimate the pose of the drogue. A simulation and ground experiment are used to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves good performance compared with other methods.",Drone,2019
Position Tracking Control of Tailsitter VTOL UAV With Bounded Thrust-Vectoring Propulsion System,"This paper presents an adaptive position tracking controller for a special kind of tailsitter vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The distinctive part of this VTOL aircraft is its thrust-vectoring propulsion system, which allows the aircraft to achieve long-range flight at high-efficiency. However, there are two main problems encountered in the control design for this aircraft in vertical mode. One problem is that the mass and inertia tensor are unknown parameters because of the fuel consumption. The other problem is that the thrust vector is bounded both in amplitude and orientation, leading to the boundedness of control input. In this paper, we use a complementary filter to estimate the mass and an adaptive law to compensate the error caused by inertia uncertainty. A Lyapunov-based control law with nested saturation function is proposed to solve the problem of input boundedness. Finally, the global asymptotic stability is proven for the simplified model and the effectiveness is illustrated through simulation.",Drone,2019
A Low Latency Clustering Method for Large-Scale Drone Swarms,"Large-scale drone swarms are expected to play an important role in information acquisition, rescue search and joint fire strikes. These swarms usually adopt a clustering structure to control formation flight for fast and stable communication. Effective clustering can improve the transmission efficiency and task execution ability of the network. On the basis of uniform clustering, we establish a model with the number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the number of cluster heads (CHs) as variables to minimize the communication latency. Using conditional criteria, the communication delay is minimized to solve the relationship between the number of drones and the number of CHs, and this model is for clustering. A simulation platform is built with OPNET to evaluate the impact of different numbers of CHs on the network performance. According to the proposed scheme, the optimal number of CHs for 500, 300, 100 UAVs is 31, 24, 14, respectively. In the case of specific simulation parameters, these optimal numbers of CHs can achieve excellent performance in terms of delay and packet loss rate. This result has value in drone swarms clustering applications.",Drone,2019
Design and Training of Deep CNN-Based Fast Detector in Infrared SUAV Surveillance System,"Real-time detection of small unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) targets in SUAV surveillance systems has become a challenge due to their high mobility, sudden bursts, and small sizes. In this study, we used infrared sensors and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based detectors to achieve the real-time detection of SUAV targets. Existing object detectors generally suffer from a computational burden or low detection accuracy on small targets, which limits their practicality and further application in SUAV surveillance systems. To solve these problems, we developed a real-time SUAV target detection algorithm based on deep residual networks. In order to improve the sensitivity to small targets, a laterally connected multi-scale feature fusion approachwas proposed to fully combine the context features and semantic features. A densely paved pre-defined box with geometric analysis was used for single-stage prediction. Compared with the state-of-the-art object detectors, the proposed method achieved superior performance with respect to average-precision and frames-per-second. As the training set was limited, to improve generalization, we investigate the benefits introduced by data augmentation and data balance, and proposed a weighted augmentation approach. The proposed approach improved the robustness of the detector and the overall accuracy.",Drone,2019
Research on breakthrough and innovation of UAV mission planning method based on cloud computing-based reinforcement learning algorithm,"The UAV system has evolved in the direction of intelligence and autonomy.

The fuzzy inference system is used to dynamically adjust the parameters of the RRT algorithm according to the real-time information of the task environment and the growth status of the RRT random tree. The experimental results show that the two improved algorithms can obtain better planning results than the single artificial potential field method and ant colony algorithm, effectively shorten the route planning time, improve the planning accuracy, and obtain the optimal flight path.",Drone,2019
Novel Fuzzy PID-Type Iterative Learning Control for Quadrotor UAV,"Due to the under-actuated and strong coupling characteristics of quadrotor aircraft, traditional trajectory tracking methods have low control precision, and poor anti-interference ability. A novel fuzzy proportional-interactive-derivative (PID)-type iterative learning control (ILC) was designed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The control method combined PID-ILC control and fuzzy control, so it inherited the robustness to disturbances and system model uncertainties of the ILC control. A new control law based on the PID-ILC algorithm was introduced to solve the problem of chattering caused by an external disturbance in the ILC control alone. Fuzzy control was used to set the PID parameters of three learning gain matrices to restrain the influence of uncertain factors on the system and improve the control precision. The system stability with the new design was verified using Lyapunov stability theory. The Gazebo simulation showed that the proposed design method creates effective ILC controllers for quadrotor aircraft.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Linear Quadratic Attitude Tracking Control of a Quadrotor UAV Based on IMU Sensor Data Fusion,"In this paper, an infinite-horizon adaptive linear quadratic tracking (ALQT) control scheme is designed for optimal attitude tracking of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The proposed control scheme is experimentally validated in the presence of real-world uncertainties in quadrotor system parameters and sensor measurement. The designed control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of the close-loop system with the help of complete controllability of the attitude dynamics in applying optimal control signals. To achieve robustness against parametric uncertainties, the optimal tracking solution is combined with an online least squares based parameter identification scheme to estimate the instantaneous inertia of the quadrotor. Sensor measurement noises are also taken into account for the on-board Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors. To improve controller performance in the presence of sensor measurement noises, two sensor fusion techniques are employed, one based on Kalman filtering and the other based on complementary filtering. The ALQT controller performance is compared for the use of these two sensor fusion techniques, and it is concluded that the Kalman filter based approach provides less mean-square estimation error, better attitude estimation, and better attitude control performance.",Drone,2019
Longitudinal Attitude Control Decoupling Algorithm Based on the Fuzzy Sliding Mode of a Coaxial-Rotor UAV,"A longitudinal attitude decoupling algorithm based on the fuzzy sliding mode control for a small coaxial rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented in this paper. The attitude system of a small coaxial rotor UAV is characterized by nonlinearity, strong coupling and uncertainty, which causes difficulties pertaining to its flight control. According to its six-degree-of-freedom model and structural characteristics, the dynamic model was established, and a longitudinal attitude decoupling algorithm was proposed. A fuzzy sliding mode control was used to design the controller to adapt to the underactuated system. Compared with the uncoupled fuzzy sliding mode control, simulation results indicated that the proposed method could improve the stability of the system, presented with a better adapting ability, and could effectively suppress the modeling error and external interference of the coaxial rotor aircraft attitude system. The proposed method also has the advantages of high accuracy, good stability, and the ease of implementation.",Drone,2019

A mathematical model of the quadcopter UAV is first introduced when faults occur in actuators. A normal adaptive sliding mode control (NASMC) approach is proposed as a baseline controller to handle the chattering problem and system uncertainties, which does not require information of the upper bound. To improve the performance of the NASMC scheme, radial basis function neural networks are combined with an adaptive scheme to make a quick compensation in presence of system uncertainties and actuator faults. The Lyapunov theory is applied to verify the stability of the proposed methods. The effectiveness of modified ASMC algorithm is compared with that of NASMC using numerical examples under different faulty conditions.",Drone,2019

The CFTC system is formed by two subsystems, that is, the robust-fault-tolerant control (RFTC) and the topology faults reconfiguration and optimization algorithm (TFROA). The RFTC is introduced for compensating the UAV faults for each UAV, including a back-stepping controller integrated with a cascade observer for resisting uncertainty and control surface faults, and two adaptive observers for compensating the actuator faults.

Finally, the effectiveness and potential of the CFTC system are demonstrated by the simulation results.",Drone,2019
Layered Visibility Graph With Convex Hull to Avoid the Complex Terrain for UAV,"This paper introduces a method which can be effectively used for the path planning of UAV in a realistic map which has mountainous terrains, air defense networks and radars based on the Visibility Graph. Existing studies of Visibility Graph have been studied mainly for simple shape obstacles in 2-dimensional environment such as self-driving cars which avoid buildings. However, for UAV, Visibility Graph must be used in 3-dimensional environment for the variance of altitude. This occurs significant elapsed time increase because of the increase of the amount of the visibility of node sets. To solve this problem, this paper decrease the number of nodes which consists the complex terrain environments using convex hull based on Layered Visibility Graph.

Position and Velocity Estimation of Moving Vehicles with a Drone,"Recently, small unmanned aerial vehicle technology is rapidly being used in various fields. Drones are very useful for airborne surveillance due to the efficiency of capturing remote scenes. Tracking multiple moving targets is essential for visual surveillance. This paper addresses the estimation of the position and velocity of moving vehicles using a drone. Detection is performed by frame difference and thresholding, morphological filtering, and removing false alarms considering the true size of vehicles. In order to calculate the frame difference, the moving average of the previous frame is first obtained to be the reference frame. The center of the detected area is input as the measured position for tracking.Tracking is performed by Kalman filter to estimate the state vector of a target composed of two dimensional positions and velocities. The state vector is updated by the measurement closest to the predicted position at the statistical distance. In the experiments, seven moving cars are captured by a drone over 150 meters. The root-mean squared errors of position and velocity show the reliability of the proposed system.",Drone,2019
A Study on Vision-based Landing Mark Tracking Algorithm for Delivery Drones,"This paper is concerned with visual trackers for vision-based landing of delivery drones. To date most delivery drones have depended on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) like GPS (Global Positioning System) for landing. However, we believe that for security reasons the drone operator should make sure the landing spot is clear by watching the streaming video from the drone and point the final landing spot in the image. In this study assuming an operational concept in which the operator points the landing spot on the drone video as the drone approaches the landing place, a comparison study of three visual trackers (MOSSE, KCF, DSST) is described. Especially, considering a distinctive property that the landing mark size increases dramatically as a drone draws near the landing place and real-time requirement of visual tracker, we propose how to adjust parameters of the visual trackers. For the size of tracking window is fixed in MOSSE and KCF filters, the time spent for filtering is almost constant as drone approaches the landing mark. However, in case of DSST, as the maximum tracking window size parameter changes from 480 pixels to 60 pixels, the filtering speed becomes almost eight times faster. When the maximum tracking window size parameter is 120 pixels, good performance is shown in terms of tracking and filtering time. Video data obtained from flying a commercial drone are utilized for a performance evaluation and comparison study, and methods to apply the results to delivery drones are proposed.",Drone,2019

Torsional response of stiffened circular composite spar,"To reduce the structural weight, thin-walled circular composite tube has been used as a main spar of high altitude-long endurance unmanned air vehicle(HALE UAV). Predicting the torsional response of stiffened circular spar is complex due to the inhomogeneous nature of section properties, which are dependent on fiber architecture and constituent material properties. The stiffener were placed in the top and bottom sectors of a tube to increase the torsional capabilities such as the rigidity and buckling strength. Numerical simulations were performed to estimate the effect of the stiffener on the torsional capacities. A static experimental test was performed on a stiffened tube, and the test results were compared with a numerical model. The numerical models showed good correlation and demonstrated the ability to predict the torsional capacity. Results presented herein will exhibit the effectiveness of stiffener on torsional strength and stiffness.",Drone,2019
Project Design Plan for Drone Photogrammetry,"The drone photogrammetry is actively utilized for obtaining highly accurate spatial information and other various monitoringpurposes. It is general to plan the drone photogrammetry by referring to previous experiences or cases in order to obtain the requiredaccuracy, but the drone photogrammetry is often carried out again due to poor accuracy. Since the required spatial accuracy of thedrone photogrammetry process result becomes the means of objective evaluation regardless of the type of result, it should be determined carefully. Therefore, it is necessary to determine flight height, overlap, number and arrangement of ground control point, and exteriororientation factor acquisition method in order to meet the required 3D positional accuracy for the design of drone photogrammetryproject. In this study, previous study cases for the analysis of drone photogrammetry accuracy were carefully analyzed and verified byapplying such cases to testing area, and design guideline of drone photogrammetry project for a small area was prepared based on theanalysis result.

Automatic Geo-referencing of Sequential Drone Images Using Linear Features and Distinct Points,"Images captured by drone have the advantage of quickly constructing spatial information in small areas and are applied to fields that require quick decision making. If an image registration technique that can automatically register the drone image on the ortho-image with the ground coordinate system is applied, it can be used for various analyses. In this study, a methodology for geo-referencing of a single image and sequential images using drones was proposed even if they differ in spatio-temporal resolution using linear features and distinct points. Through the method using linear features, projective transformation parameters for the initial geo-referencing between images were determined, and then finally the geo-referencing of the image was performed through the template matching for distinct points that can be extracted from the images. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of the geo-referencing was high in an area where relief displacement of the terrain was not large. On the other hand, there were some errors in the quantitative aspect of the area where the change of the terrain was large. However, it was considered that the results of geo-referencing of the sequential images could be fully utilized for the qualitative analysis.",Drone,2019
Geo-fencing Method for Low Altitude Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management,"In order to safely fly unmanned aircraft systems(UAS) at low altitudes, an UAS Traffic Management(UTM) system capable of integrally managing UAS operations is required. The UTM system consists of various components, and one of the key components is geo-fence which is set around the flight path or an obstacle, thus creating a space to secure the safe flight of an UAS. In this paper, we propose a method that automatically generates geo-fences based on given obstacles or flight plan information. The proposed method consists of boundary extrusion, tapering, merging and simplification steps. It is designed to guarantee the size of buffer zone between UAS and an obstacle and to reduce the data needed to define geo-fence and unnecessary space. A case study on the proposed method generates keep-out geo-fences for building data in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and also creates a keep-in geo-fence on the basis of the UAS flight planned path. In this paper, we propose a geo-fence generation method that can be applied to UTM system in the future. Also, it is significant that various issues to be considered in the generation of the geo-fence are suggested.",Drone,2019

For operation as making use of UAV, SWaP(Size, Weight and Power) constraints of UAV must be considered. In the proposed model, Airborne communication relay UAV transmits real-time signals of the crashed UAV and its location to the GCS. GCS estimates the location of the crashed UAV based on TDOA(Time Difference of Arrival) and provides the trajectory to airborne communication relay UAV for the crashed UAV to improve its accuracy of the estimated location.

Legislative Needs for Protecting Drone¡¯s Radio Frequency Use,"While the possibility of collision or crash of drone caused by radio interference would not be completely excluded, such problem is to be solved for the safety. The role of the radiocommunication regime is to ensure the rational, equitable, efficient and economical use of the radio-frequency spectrum by all radiocommunication services, including CNPC services, Current radio regulation regime, however, is aiming at the efficiency of frequency utilization so that the rules in cause would be for the purpose other than the aviation safety.Communications are key in drone systems due to the remote nature of human presence. Safety-of-flight is the driving factor when the seamless flight of drone is at stake. In the end, safe operation of drone relies on communications which represents a critical step in enabling drone operations in non-segregated airspaces. Safe operations of future drone in non-segregated airspace may need independent back-up communications to ensure high reliability of the critical communications links. That is why the drone is entitled to the primary user basis for CNPC band. On the high seas airspace, the use of the CNPC frequency by drone is entitled to the protection from harmful interference, so that the nationality state of interfering device should take the responsibility.But in any other bands than the specific band distributed for drone CNPC on primary user right basis, the frequency use of drone is in principle not entitled to the protection from other harmful interference of any other frequency users. Stations of a secondary service shall not cause harmful interference to stations of primary services to which frequencies are already assigned or to which frequencies may be assigned at a later date; cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations of a primary service to which frequencies are already assigned or may be assigned at a later date.In conclusion, it should be stressed that strong effort for making law must be pursued to assure clear and well defined distribution of responsibility and burden regarding the interference problem among the drone users and radio frequency users.",Drone,2019

Thermal and Temperature Analysis for an Actuation Controller of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles are widely used for the collection of information, reconnaissance flight and a search operation in military fields, mechanical engineering, and aerospace and aeronautical engineering. An actuation controller of an unmanned aerial vehicle is seriously affected by payloads when the unmanned aerial vehicle is flying. It is important to ensure reliability of the actuation controller since its operation should be kept with a precision. The temperature of the environment where the actuation controller is used is about -30C-50C(243K-323K). Heat generated in the actuation controller should be maintained within certain threshold levels,(-30C-95C(243K-368K) to ensure reliability. Therefore, the study and analysis of the heatflow characteristics in the actuation controller are required. In the paper, commercial software Solid-Works for 3-D modeling and Cosmos/Flow- Works for the numerical simulations were used. In this paper, safe design of the actuation controller is proposed by analyzing the thermal and flow characteristics inside of the actuation controller composed of chips and boards.",Drone,2019
Data Pre-Caching Mechanism in NDN-based Drone Networks,"Networking services based on the flying drones may cause many handover events because the coverage radius isnarrower than that of the existing infrastructure, such as cellular networks. Therefore, it copes with frequent handoverby pre-caching data to target network provider before handover using a content store. As a result of the simulation,it can be confirmed that the delay is lowered. This is because the data that was requested before the handover isdelivered to the target drones, and the car that has completed the handover receives the data through the targetdrones. On the other hand, if the proposed method is not used, it can be confirmed that the delay is increased. Thisis because it can not cope with the path change due to the handover and re-sends the packet requesting the data.",Drone,2019
Automatic Multi-drone Path Planning using Network Flow Algorithms,"The aerial show of 1,218 drones in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was realized by animators drawing up the show with 3D design software in advance and by a central computer determining and assigning onsite which drone will play the role of which pixel in the animation. Manual creation of an animation in which a thousand drones move in harmony without collision is an expensive and difficult task. Thus, we propose a drone simulator to automate this process: given initial and final images, the system samples a given number of initial and final locations of drones, computes collision-free drone paths automatically (each starting from an initial location and arriving at a final location), and visualizes the results as a video. The set of drone paths is optimal in terms of the last arrival time, which is a desirable feature for drone paths.We propose two methods of computing the paths: a two-phase algorithm with a collision-removal modification and a single-phase algorithm for cost optimization. The former obtains paths by running a maximum flow algorithm and modifies them to be collision-free. On the other hand, the latter computes collision-free paths directly by running a minimum cost maximum flow algorithm with a carefully designed cost assignment. Both sets of output paths have a minimum last arrival time. The single-phase method needs more time than the two-phase method but gives much better values of stretch factor (the ratio of path length to the Euclidean distance between the initial and final locations). This trade-off between computation time and stretch factor is revealed empirically in the performance comparison of the two methods.",Drone,2019
Modeling and Design of Automatic Landing Systems for Variable Span Morphing Wing UAV,"This paper describes the modeling of the aerodynamics and dynamics of a variable-span morphing wing unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV). The mass inertia moment in relation to span length is measured using Computer-aided design(CAD), and each aerodynamiccoefficient for the maximum and minimum span is derived using Digital DATCOM. Based on MATLAB/Simulink, a multidimensionalaerodynamic database is constructed using previously calculated data. The dynamic characteristics of the maximum and minimum spansare then analyzed and the trim condition defined. A PID controller and sliding mode control are designed and compared with each otherusing simulations that follow altitude commands. After confirming the suitability of the sliding mode control, an automatic landing systemis constructed using the controller. In the automatic landing system, we control the longitudinal axis glide slope and flare trajectory on theassumption that the lateral axis is stable and analyze the effect of span length deformation on automatic landings.",Drone,2019
Formation Flight Simulation and Flight Test of Multiple Ducted-fan UAV,"This study investigates the formation flight of multiple ducted-fan UAVs using Wi-Fi communication for potential coordinated or collaborative missions. The small ducted-fan UAVs are designed and fabricated in-house with electric propulsion, taking into account the flight experiment environment. The controller design for a single UAV is verified in a six degree-of-freedom dynamic simulation environment, ground testing, and flight experiments for waypoint navigation. The guidance law for formation flight is designed based mainly on a leader-follower scheme, and its applicability is verified through software in-the-loop tests. In the flight experiments, each ducted-fan UAV is equipped with a Pixhawk flight control board and a Raspberry Pi 3 board for UDP communication between UAVs. Data communication between the ducted-fan UAVs and other computers is performed using a MAVProxy protocol. The flight test results are analyzed to verify the proposed formation flight system and algorithm.",Drone,2019
Development of a Trajectory Generation and Tracking Control System for a Quadrotor UAV,"In this paper, we describe the development of a trajectory generation and trajectory tracking control system for a quadrotor UAV. The trajectory generation algorithm generates minimum snap trajectories which minimizes effort for actuation of motors, and the geometric control based trajectory tracking controller is utilized for tracking given trajectories precisely. The trajectory tracking controller generates a thrust command and angular rate commands for an inner-loop angular rate controller. To identify flight control performance, we developed a quadrotor platform and carried out flight experiments using circle and figure 8 trajectories. The flight experiment results show that the quadrotor UAV precisely follows the commanded trajectories in real flight environments.",Drone,2019
Triple Inertial Sensor Redundancy for the Attitude Control of a Small Multi-Copter-Type Drone and Flight Tests Using Pixhawk,"In this study, triple redundant inertial sensors are combined into one module and the weighted average of the acceleration measurements from the three sensors is used to control the attitude of a small multi-copter-type drone, with flight tests used to verify the validity of the approach. In particular, a sensor failure detection and accommodation algorithm based on three redundant sensors is proven to be effective in these tests. This fault detection and accommodation algorithm improves the reliability of drones. A fault injection function is designed for flight tests, and the fault detection and accommodation algorithm is implemented on a flight control computer (Pixhawk). A method for calibrating the sensor output size and alignment with respect to the body frame is also developed.",Drone,2019
Airdrop Operation and Autonomous Flight-Back Experiment of Dual Unmanned Aircraft,"One of the major disadvantages of the unmanned aircraft such as a drone is that it has finite capacity of the battery and it is almost impossible to change the battery during the flight. In order to overcome the drawback, this research proposes a novel airdrop operation with dual unmanned aircraft. The suggested dual unmanned aircraft is composed of a carrier octo-copter and a mission quad-copter. The carrier octo-copter with large payload carries the mission quad-copter and flies with its energy source. After fully consuming the energy, the carrier octo-copter drops the mission quad-copter in the air. Then, the mission quad-copter starts to operate its designated mission with its own energy source. To enable the airdrop operation, a foldable structure of the mission quad-copter was developed. Intensive experiments to verify this airdrop flight mechanism were carried out with autonomous flight-back to the destination. The position and altitude data during experiments were acquired using the GPS and barometer in the quad-copter flight control unit. Synthesizing the information from the experiments, it is confirmed that the suggested idea can be a promising alternative to enlarge the flight distance and duration of the unmanned aircraft.",Drone,2019
A study of the Combination of LQR Control and PILCO Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique that autonomously learns a control policy for performing a desired mission. Probabilistic inference for learning control (PILCO) is known as one of the rapid RL methods because of its capability to build a data-efficient structure based on a Bayesian inference with a Gaussian process from which it guarantees an optimal solution without repetitive computations. However, PILCO still suffers from a number of training iterations when it is applied to an autonomous UAV control system. To boost the learning convergence rate, in this paper, we suggest a combination of linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control and PILCO reinforcement learning. The simulation study to learn a velocity command for quadrotor trajectory tracking in a reinforcement learning framework demonstrated that the proposed algorithm had a more rapid convergence rate and better tracking performance than the original PILCO algorithm.",Drone,2019
"Design and Controller Development of Drone Capable of Landing, Takeoff, and Travelling on a Vertical Wall","This paper describes the development of a drone design and controller capable of landing and driving on the outer wall of a building, delivering the object to the target location and after completing the mission, then taking off from the outer wall and re-flying. It suggests a solution that can fulfill a mission even in the windy conditions, which is the biggest weakness of the drone. Four motors and wheels are located on the drone¡¯s body to drive on the wall, and the damper was designed based on impact analysis. To avoid interference with the wheels, brushless DC (BLDC) motors are installed at the bottom of the drone, and propeller guards are designed to prevent collisions with the wall. The thrust must be specially controlled to attach this drone to the wall and to take it off the wall.",Drone,2019
The study on structural vulnerability analysis of small fixed wing UAV with hard landing,"In this paper, the structural weakness analysis and quality improvement of small fixed wing UAV of the hard landing type were studied. Unlike conventional aircraft, small UAV does not use runways because of its small size. Instead, small UAV use hand launch takeoff and hard landings. This type has many operational advantages because it can take off and land in a narrow space. But, the hard landing has a strong impact on the structure of the UAV and can cause serious damage. In order to analyze the exact cause of this phenomenon, the structural analysis was carried out using the 3D structural analysis program (ABAQUS) to identify the location of the fracture. And to improve the accuracy of the structural analysis, properties of the material were obtained through specimen test. As a result of the analysis, structural weaknesses were identified and improved. Thus, the validity of the study was verified by demonstrating the quality of enhanced structure through a real impact test at a higher level of 1.5 times the maximum impact during operation.",Drone,2019
A Study on the Applicability of Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection and Resolving of Occlusion Area,"Recently, spatial information is being constructed actively based on the images obtained by drones. Because occlusion areas occur due to buildings as well as many obstacles, such as trees, pedestrians, and banners in the urban areas, an efficient way to resolve the problem is necessary. Instead of the traditional way, which replaces the occlusion area with other images obtained at different positions, various models based on deep learning were examined and compared. A comparison of a type of feature descriptor, HOG, to the machine learning-based SVM, deep learning-based DNN, CNN, and RNN showed that the CNN is used broadly to detect and classify objects. Until now, many studies have focused on the development and application of models so that it is impossible to select an optimal model. On the other hand, the upgrade of a deep learning-based detection and classification technique is expected because many researchers have attempted to upgrade the accuracy of the model as well as reduce the computation time. In that case, the procedures for generating spatial information will be changed to detect the occlusion area and replace it with simulated images automatically, and the efficiency of time, cost, and workforce will also be improved.",Drone,2019
A Collision Simulation Study on the Structural Stability for a Programmable Drone,"A programmable drone is a drone developed not only to experience the basic principles of flight but also to control drones through Arduino-based programming. Due to the nature of the training drones, the main users are students who are inexperienced in controlling the drones, which often cause frequent collisions with external objects, resulting in high damage to the drones' frame. In this study, the structural stability of the drone was evaluated by means of a structural dynamics based collision simulation for educational drone frame. Collision simulations were performed on three cases according to the impact angle of 0?¡ã, +15?¡ã and -15?¡ã, using an analytical model with approximately 240,000 tetrahedron elements. Using ANSYS LS-DYNA, which provides excellent functions for the simulation of the dynamic behavior of three-dimensional structures, the stress distribution and strain generated on the drone upper, the drone lower, and the ring assembly were analyzed when the drones collided against the wall at a rate of 4 m/s. Safety factors resulting from the equivalent stress and the yield strain were calculated in the range of 0.72 to 2.64 and 1.72 to 26.67, respectively. To ensure structural stability for areas where stress exceeds yield strain and ultimate strain according to material properties, the design reinforcement is presented.",Drone,2019
A Study on Terrain Construction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulator Based on Spatial Information,"This paper covers research on terrain construction for unmanned aerial vehicle simulators using spatial information that was distributed by public institutions. Aerial photography, DEM, vector maps and 3D model data were used in order to create a realistic terrain simulator. A data converting method was suggested while researching, so it was generated to automatically arrange and build city models (vWorld provided) and classification methods so that realistic images could be generated by 3D objects. For example: rivers, forests, roads, fields and so on, were arranged by aerial photographs, vector map (land cover map) and terrain construction based on the tile map used by DEM. In order to verify the terrain data of unmanned aircraft simulators produced by the proposed method, the location accuracy was verified by mounting onto Unreal Engine and checked location accuracy.",Drone,2019
Object Detection Using CNN for Automatic Landing of drones,"Unmanned aircraft must be in a stable position during takeoff, landing and flight to perform tasks such as monitoring. Existing drones use the Return To Home function, which automatically returns to the take-off point and landing when in flight. This method has the disadvantage that it is difficult to land at the correct point because the landing takes place using GPS. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that recognizes the landing point by attaching the vision sensor to the quadrotor type unmanned aerial vehicle and automatically landing. Using the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based algorithm, it is possible to reduce the occurrence of disturbance or object recognition error at the landing point, using the vision data to calculate the coordinates of the landing point and to control the landing precisely at the point. In order to verify the validity of the algorithm, the landing using the Return to Home function and the GPS data of the landing using the proposed algorithm were compared and verified by experiments.",Drone,2019
Dynamic Slot Re-assignment Scheme for Network Merge in Swarming Drone Networks,"In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamic slot re-assignment scheme for swarming drone networks in whichnetworks members merged and split frequently. The leader drone of each network recognizes the slot allocationinformation of neighbor networks by periodic information exchange among between the drones. Using the information, theleader drone makes a decision how to reallocate the slots between members in case of network merge. Thenon-competitive method in the proposed scheme can re-assign the slots without any slot collision and shows alwayssuperior performance than competitive scheme. The competitive method in the proposed scheme reduces the number ofslots that should be re-assigned in case of network merge. The experimental performance analysis shows that the proposedscheme performs better or at least equal to the performance of the competitive scheme in a swarming drone network.",Drone,2019
Design of Context-Aware-Based Drone Control Mechanism by Using Two-Factor,"Drones, which are used in various fields, are vulnerable to various security threats such as physical deodorization attacksand information leakage attacks because they operate in an unmanned environment and use wireless communication withweak security.

Fixed-wing Aircraft Course Control in Significant Wind,"Basically the dynamics of the fixed-wing aircraft is based on the airspeed which is relative to the wind, but when it comes to the track guidance and control, ground speed is the factor to be considered. Especially in the case of low-speed fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles the difference between the airspeed and the ground speed is significant depending on wind conditions, so that the heading control and the course control have to be designed separately. This paper represents the course control method using the pre-designed heading control gains which meet the desired characteristics. Also, waypoint guidance and control algorithms are suggested applying this control method. Finally the robustness of the proposed method is confirmed by 6-DoF nonlinear simulation.",Drone,2019
Simulation Study on Search Strategies for the Reconnaissance Drone,"The use of drone-bots is demanded in times regarding the reduction of military force, the spread of the life-oriented thought, and the use of innovative technology in the defense through the fourth industrial revolution.Especially, the drone¡¯s surveillance and reconnaissance are expected to play a big role in the future battlefield.However, there are not many cases in which the concept of operation is studied scientifically. In this study, We propose search algorithms for reconnaissance drone through simulation analysis. In the simulation, the drone and target move linearly in continuous space, and the target is moving adopting the Random-walk concept to reflect the uncertainty of the battlefield. The research investigates the effectiveness of existing search methods such as Parallel and Spiral Search. We analyze the probabilistic analysis for detector radius and the speed on the detection probability. In particular, the new detection algorithms those can be used when an enemy moves toward a specific goal, PS (Probability Search) and HS (Hamiltonian Search), are introduced. The results of this study will have applicability on planning the path for the reconnaissance operations using drone-bots.",Drone,2019
The Propose of Requirements Based on Safety Assessment for UAV Handover,"Recently, UAV manufacturers are developing UAV system in a form that can be controlled by CS regardless of UAV kind and using STANAG 4586 interface standard considering Interoperability.STANAG 4586 is a NATO military standard developed to control various UAVs with standardized equipment. In such a case, UAV handover will inevitably occur and it is one of the most important function for safe UAV flight in platform using STANAG 4586. In the future combat situation where collaboration between AV and UAV is anticipated, seamless handover of UAV is a part of continuous research. In this paper, we propose requirements for UAV handover based on ARP 4761 safety assessment and analyze feasibility of the requirements by comparing UAV handover process in STANAG 4586. As a result of the comparative analysis, the proposed handover requirements based on ARP 4761 includes all the handover procedures of STANAG 4586 and present additional considerations for SOP creation and CS development. Applying the proposed handover requirements in the UAV development process can reduce the probability of loss of UAV control over the handover process and it can be expected to help improve the safety of UAV.",Drone,2019
Application of STANAG-4586 Ed. 4 based Standardization for Up-to-Dated Interoperability of Military UAV System,"With the development of various types of military Unmanned Aircraft(UA)s, the need for interworking and integration between different platforms gradually increased. In order to ensure interoperability at each military UA System(UAS) level, North Atlantic Treaty Organization(NATO) has established STANAG-4586 ""Standard Interfaces of Unmanned Aircraft(UA) Control Systems(UCS) for NATO UA Interoperability-Interface Control Document"".This paper looks at the basic design structure of STANAG-4586 and the changes on Edition 4 to enhance joint operational capability through reflecting and updating the interoperability design of the military UAS. In particular, we analyze the enhanced Datalink Transition/Handover Procedure and Autonomous functions, one of the biggest features added to the edition. Through this, we propose a modification of UA data link exclusive control using UA Bypass structure, which was impossible in the one-to-one communication structure between existing UA and Core UCS(CUCS). We also suggest ways to improve UA operational reliability by applying Autonomous Functions that directly decides how to deal with emergency situations, rather than by a remote operator over CUCS.",Drone,2019
Drone Surveillance System Considering Dynamic POIs,"This study proposes a new drone surveillance system by considering the relative importance of spatial area underthe surveillance. Traditionally, the drone surveillance systems employed a simple routing rule often realized aszig-zag movements without alternation of altitude. Recognizing that the altitude of drones can be manipulated totake more detailed pictures of the POIs (Points of Interest), we represent a new mathematical formulation and anefficient heuristic algorithm that considers not only the locations but the altitude of drones. We also incorporate amachine learning algorithm to identify POIs inside the given area, which enables us to implement a fully automateddrone surveillance system. The proposed system is superior to the previous ones because the consideration of therelative importance of POIs makes the drone cover the non-POI areas much more efficiently by using higheraltitude and taking fewer photos. We implement a proof-of-the-concept of the proposed algorithm, and reportresults obtained from real-world test cases.",Drone,2019
Generation and Comparison of 3-Dimensional Geospatial Information using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Photogrammetry Software,"Purpose: We generated geospatial information of unmanned aerial vehicle based on various SW and analyzed the location accuracy of orthoimage and DSM and texture mapping of 3D mesh. Method: The same unmanned aerial image data is processed using two different SW, and spatial information is generated. Among the generated spatial information, the orthoimage and DSM were compared with the spatial information generation results of the unmanned aerial photogrammetry SW by performing quantitative analysis by calculating RMSE of horizontal position and vertical position error and performing qualitative analysis. Results: There were no significant differences in the positional accuracy of the orthoimage and DSM generated by each SW, and differences in texture mapping in 3D mesh. The creation of the 3D mesh indicated the impact of the Unmanned Aerial Photogrammetry SW. Conclusion: It is shown that there is no effect of SW on the creation of orthoimage and DSM for geospatial analysis based on unmanned aerial vehicle. However, when 3D visualization is performed, texture mapping results are different depending on SW.",Drone,2019
Enhancement of UAV-based Spatial Positioning Using the Triangular Center Method with Multiple GPS,"Recently, a technique for acquiring spatial information data using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) has been greatly developed. It is a very crucial issue of the GIS (Geographic Information System) mapping system that passes way point in the unmanned airframe and finally measures the accurate image and stable localization to the desired destination. Though positioning using DGPS (Differential Global Navigation System) or RTK-GPS (Real Time Kinematic-GPS) guarantee highly accurate, they are more expensive than the construction of a single positioning system using a single GPS. In the case of a low-priced single GPS system, the stability of the positioning data deteriorates. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the uncertainty of the absolute position data of the UAV and to improve the accuracy of the current position data economically in the operating state of the UAV. The aim of this study was to present an algorithm enhancing the stability of position data in a single GPS mode of UAV with multiple GPS. First, the arrangement of multiple GPS receivers through the center of gravity of the UAV were examined. Next, MD (Mahalanobis Distance) is applied to detect instantaneous errors of GPS data in advance and eliminate outliers to increase the accuracy of previously collected multiple GPS data. Processing procedure for multiple GPS reception data by applying the center of the triangular method were presented to improve the position accuracy. Second, UAV navigation systems integrated multiple GPS through configuration of the UAV specifications were implemented. Using the unmanned airframe equipped with multiple GPS receivers, GPS data is measured with the TCM (Triangular Center Method). In addition, UAV equipped with multiple GPS were operated in study area and locational accuracy of multiple GPS of UAV with VRS (Virtual Reference Station) GNSS surveying were compared. The result showed that the error factors are compensated, and the error range are reduced, resulting in the reliability of the corrected value. In conclusion, the result in this paper is expected to realize high-precision position estimation at low cost in UAV using multiple low-cost GPS receivers.",Drone,2019
Duty Specification Training Plan for Utilizing Drone by the Marine Police,"The origin of 'drone' means male bees because the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle¡¯s propeller sound is like that of male bees flying in the sky. A drone was used for the military purpose for the first time. Afterwards, drones got compact and functionalized, and has been being used for many purposes not only of recreation but of product delivery etc. among people. Recently, in order to its wide and practical use of drones, various national and public organizations try to maximize the use of drones through its developing duty function and loading equipment. The development and distribution of drones to perform public service mission would be rapidly increased.The marine police has been made efforts to introduce drones with positive interest in performing their jobs through the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.

A Study on the Establishment of Anti-Drone Concept and Effective Response System,"Due to the development of technology and popularization of drone, the so-called ""dirty drone"" that exploits drones for crimes and terrorism has become a social problem, and it is time to seriously consider the ""revenge of drones."" Indeed, the cases of threats posed by drones are expanding not only to threats to ground facilities, but also to aviation safety threats, more recently to large-scale events, demonstrations and crimes targeting specific personnel, and terrorism.This research clearly defined the concept of anti-drone when it emerged as a new type of social safety threat as it was abused in crime and terrorism, while response to it was not enough yet. Through this process, it was intended to present an effective anti-drones system. We analyzed the major controversial elements of anti-drone, and defined them as ""comprehensive response activities at the legal, institutional and technical levels performed by law enforcement agencies, related technology and industrial entities in a way that prevents, detects, and blocks acts that violate public well-being and order, such as crimes and terrorism caused by the drones."" To effectively respond to dirty drones, the authority of law enforcement agencies and the enactment of relevant laws were proposed. In the future, a comprehensive and systematic follow-up study of the anti system should be conducted.",Drone,2019
Improved Network Self-Recovery Technique for Multi-Drone Based Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"Recently, flying ad hoc network (FANET) using drone-like vehicles has been attracting attention. In particular, research on multi-drone-based FANET that supports service by grouping multi-drones rather than single drone is actively performed. The multi-drones-based FANETs can broaden service coverage through multi-hop and, in the event of specific drone failure, other drones can replace the mission to support reliable services. In this multi-drone-based FANET, the most important thing is that all drones must be connected to ground controls system (GCS) directly or through multi-hop. However, if the connection is cut off due to the drones' mobility, the problems of isolating drones and network disconnection may arise. In this paper, we propose a technique to enable drone to recognize link disconnection quickly and to recover the network in the multi-drone based FANET environment. The proposed technique uses hop count information from GCS to identify whether the drones are disconnected by themselves, and if the disconnection is confirmed through the disconnection step, the network is restored by the proposed self recovery algorithm. The performance is simulated and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through the results.",Drone,2019
A Study on the Ranging Methods for the UAV Data-Link Systems,"Generally, inertial navigation system (INS) is used for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. However, if global positioning system (GPS) does not operate normally due to interference or satellite jamming, the position error of INS is linearly increased. In this time, the positioning method using data-link system is one of candidates for the GPS. Data-link based positioning can be divided direction measurement and ranging. In this paper, two ranging methods for data-link based positioning are introduced. In addition, we will discuss the problems that need to be considered in implementing ranging and how to solve them.",Drone,2019
Efficient Detection of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Cluttered Environment,"In this paper, we propose a method to detect small unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) flying in a real-world environment. Small UAV signals are frequently obscured by clutter signals because UAVs usually fly at low altitudes over urban or mountainous terrain. Therefore, to obtain a desirable detection performance, clutter signals must be considered in addition to noise, and thus, a performance analysis of each clutter removal technique is required. The proposed detection process uses clutter removal and pulse integration methods to suppress clutter and noise signals, and then detects small UAVs by utilizing a constant false alarm rate detector. After applying three clutter removal techniques, we analyzed the performance of each technique in detecting small UAVs. Based on experimental data acquired in a real-world outdoor environment, we found it was possible to derive a clutter removal method suitable for the detection of small UAVs.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Image Reconstruction for Compact Drone-Borne SAR using GPU Signal Processing,"Although the back-projection algorithm(BPA) is the best method for image reconstruction of air-borne synthetic-aperture radar(SAR), it requires a long processing time.

A Study on the Influence of External Factors on Anti-Drone Jamming,"This study is a follow-up study of Kim et al.(2018) police anti_drone empirical study that reported success rate of malicious_drone anti_jamming from 93% to 98%. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of external factors on the anti_drone jamming by exploring 2~3% of the anti_drone jamming failure factors based on external factors, and to provide information on anti_drone jamming performance improvement and operation practice.Therefore, the study method should be based on the frame of reference of external factors (wind speed, cloud amount, humidity) and T test.As a result of the analysis, the average success rate of anti_drone jamming by model and type, the days with a wind speed of more then 8?, was 0.04 at alow rate and 0.129 at most, the days above more than below 3.5 the cloud amount, was 0.02 at alow rate and 0.218 at most, the days above more than below 65% the humidity, was 0.03 at alow rate and 0.243 at most, respectively. In the confidence interval estimating the likelihood of the actual population average at 95% confidence interval, the success rate of the anti_drone jamming by model and type, the days with a wind speed of more then 8?, was ¨C0.2144 at alow rate and 0.007 at most, the days above more than below 3.5 the cloud amount, was 0.003 at alow rate and 0.2732 at most, the days above more than below 65% the humidity, was 0.003 at alow rate and 0.3161 at most, respectively.The external factors such as wind speed, cloud amount, and humidity were found to affect anti_drone jamming in both mean and 95% confidence interval. the effect was inversely proportional to the wind speed, was marked as proportional to the cloud amount, humidity, respectively.",Drone,2019
A Study on the Evolution of Drone Technology and Anti-Drone Jamming,"This study analyzes the he corelation of anti - drone jamming technology and drones, being on high-end evolution of technology.In this study, the methodology applied is a ANOVA of variance using three different models of drone with advanced communication technology. In the descriptive statistics analysis, the average of A, B, and C models were 0.96, 0.952, and 0.95, respectively. Also, the analysis of the evolution of the drone technology centered on the wind speed did not reveal the average difference in the jamming relevance between A, B, and C.First, the distribution of jamming relevance according to the evolution of the drone technology showed a significance <0.05 in the A, B, and C models in all study samples under the condition of 8? wind speed. However, in the analysis on days with wind speeds of 8 ? or more, the probability of significance in B and C models was> 0.05.Second, the analysis of variance between model and jamming modules according to the evolution of drone technology showed a significance of> 0.05 in all conditions, And we could not confirm the difference in jamming relevance due to the evolution of the drone technology.According to the results of the analysis, the difference between the mean of each model was small, but the difference of the standard deviation suggests that future drone technology evolution will affect jamming. In the post-analysis between the model and the jamming mode, the difference between the A model and the C model is narrowed. During the study, the evolution of drone technology has evolved to add stability to jamming.Therefore, this study predicts that, when the future communication technology is evolved and integrated into the design and production of the drone, there will be rising need for the development and research of the anti-drone technology and further application in the work equipment.",Drone,2019

A Study on the Beam pattern of Array antenna of VHF band using active beam pattern measuring device and Drone,"This study describes the technique of the beam pattern measurement of array antenna for VHF band radar using drone and active beam pattern measuring device. There is no anechoic chamber for measuring the beam pattern of a large size antenna in the country. In this study, to test the antenna beam pattern characteristics of the developed VHF band radar, the antenna beam pattern characteristics were tested by Drone mounting an Active Beam Pattern Measuring Device. By comparing the results of the pre-simulation analysis with the measured results for the antenna, we could confirm that the beamwidth and side-lobe characteristics are satisfactory. Through the antenna beam pattern measurement technology using Drone and Active Beam Pattern Measuring Device, the beam pattern measurement technology of array antenna of low frequency band and large antenna for low band radar will be used.",Drone,2019
Tilt-Rotor Quadrotor Control System Design and Mobile Object Tracking,"We design the navigation and control system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with four tilting rotors. The considered UAV implements the so-called X-sceme, which implies the main body and four symmetrical beams, upon which rotors with propellers are mounted. It is different from the classical quadrotor by having four additional servomotors that may change the orientation of the rotors with respect t the main body, thus increasing the control parameters number. Greater number of the actuators in the system, on the one hand, opens new venues for UAVs' applications but, on the other hand, makes the mathematical model of the UAV's dynamics quite complicated. The latter calls for new control algorithms to be developed. We start by forming the mathematical models of the UAV's dynamics. It is shown that the introduction of the tilting motors allows implementing independent control of the quadrotor's position and attitude. The control loop is designed on the base on the analytical dynamics inversion. The expressions for the control parameters thus obtained are subjected to the numerical analysis, which allows taking into account technical constraints for maximal motor speed and tilt angles. Feedback in the control loop is implemented by simulation of the on-board sensors' signals, whose characteristics correspond to those of the sensors used in the UAV's experimental prototype design. The signals are processed with the aid of the unscented Kal-man filter algorithm. The results of numerical experiments corroborate the efficiency of the developed control and navigation algorithms. The mission simulated in the numeric experiments is tracking of a pre-defined trajectory and pointing with a body-fixed camera at a mobile object, which, in turn, moves along a programmed trajectory.The results of the numeric experiments show that the UAV is capable of performing complex maneuvers with independent position and attitude control.",Drone,2019
Traumatic amputations caused by drone attacks in the local population in Gaza: a retrospective cross-sectional study,"Background Little data exist to describe the use and medical consequences of drone strikes on civilian populations in war and conflict zones. Gaza is a landstrip within the Palestinian territories and the home of 2 million people. The median age in Gaza is 17.2 years and almost half of the population is below the age of 14 years. We studied the prevalence and severity of extremity amputation injuries caused by drone strikes compared with those caused by other explosive weapons among patients with amputations attending the main physical prosthesis and rehabilitation centre in Gaza.Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we recruited patients from the Artificial Limb and Polio Centre (ALPC) in Gaza city in the Gaza strip with conflict-related traumatic extremity amputations. Patients were eligible if they had one or more amputations sustained during a military incursion in Gaza during 2006-16 and had an available patient record. Each patient completed a self-reporting questionnaire of the time and mechanism of injury, subsequent surgeries, comorbidities, and their socioeconomic status, and we collected each patient's medical history, recorded the anatomical location of their amputation or amputations, and interviewed each patient to obtain a detailed description of the incursion or incursions that led to their amputation injury. We classified the severity of amputations and number of subsequent surgeries on ordinal scales and then we determined the associations between these outcomes and the mechanism of explosive weapon delivery (drone strike vs other) using ordinal logistical regression.Findings We collected data on 254 patients from APLC who had sustained an amputation injury. Of these patients, 234 (92%) were male and 43 (17%) were aged 18 years or younger at the time of injury. The age of participants was representative of the Gaza population, with a median age at inclusion was 28 years (IQR 23-33), and the median age at the time of injury was 23 years (IQR 20-29). 136 (54%) amputation injuries were caused by explosive weapons delivered by drone strikes, with explosives delivered by tanks being the next most common source of amputation injury (28 [11%]). Adjusted for age and sex, drone-delivered weapons caused significantly more severe injuries than explosives delivered by other mechanisms (eg, military jet airplanes, helicopters, tank shelling, and naval artillery; odds ratio [OR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.52-4.11; p=0.0003). Compared with all other types of weapons, the patients whose injuries were caused by drone strikes needed significantly more subsequent surgical operations to treat their amputation injuries than those injured by other weapons (OR 1.93, 1.19-3.14; p=0.008).Interpretation Drone strikes were the most commonly reported cause of amputation injury in our study population and were associated with more severe injuries and more additional surgeries than injuries caused by other explosive weapons. Limitations of our study include the self-reported nature of the mechanism of injury and number of subsequent surgeries and selection bias from not incorporating amputation injuries from individuals who died immediately or due to complications. The increasing use of drones needs to be addressed, rather than passively accepted, by the international community. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of the civilian consequences of modern warfare and we believe it is also relevant to the growing populations that are being exposed to drone warfare and for health-care personnel treating these people.

METHODS OF ANALYZING AND PROCESSING DATA IN VIBRATION DIAGNOSTICS TASKS,"Algorithms and software for the stand intended for control and check of operability of electric engines of the unmanned aerial vehicle are developed. Evaluation of the condition of the controlled object is carried out by methods of discrete integral Fourier transform, if the number of samples in the spectral area is exceeded in the time area. The results of spectral analysis are used to determine the energy level of vibrations determined by the degree of wear of working engine units. The energy of vibrations caused by the wear of mechanical elements of the engine is located by integrating the frequency of the energy spectrum vibrations. For the calculation of the energy spectrum the function of the window constructed by Chebyshev¡¯s approximation is used. The evaluation of the duration of accident-free operation of the engine is determined by extrapolation of the energy of vibration vibrations associated with the wear of engine elements. The extrapolation method is designed to sample the finite number of discrete samples in the assumption that a small sample can be considered as a modulated signal and to restore a discrete sample into a continuous enough demodulation.",Drone,2019
Image processing of concentrated and scattered objects,"In modern control systems and information processing, the recognition of objects in the image is complicated by the fact that the impact of negative factors introduces uncertainty into this process, leading to blurring of images. In this regard, it is necessary to develop models and algorithms that would reduce the degree of uncertainty in image processing. These models are necessary, for example, when monitoring environmentally hazardous objects, for search and detection of unauthorized burial of household waste, in the field of information security, in the analysis of x-rays and thermograms, in the actions of unmanned aerial vehicles of law enforcement agencies in autonomous mode. This article presents a description of information technology for recognition in the automated mode of objects in images. The basis of this technology is the algorithm of contour analysis of images. The main distinguishing feature of the algorithm is the use of convolution of the image in four directions, as well as the tracing procedure. The aim of the study was to develop algorithms for high-speed automated visualization of external objects. We present the results of the study of the algorithm of contour analysis in the processing of various images in the visible and infrared wavelengths. Recommendations are formulated for the choice of parameters of the contour analysis algorithm, such as the mean square deviation in image blur, minimum and maximum thresholds for filtering. The results of the study can be used in production management systems, life support of the city, technical vision, environmental conditions, monitoring of business processes, as well as in the creation of simulators for training operators of complex systems, etc. In addition, we show the expediency of applying the algorithm we developed in decision support systems.",Drone,2019
Combination of Wide Baseline Image Matching and Tracking for Autonomous UAV Approaches to a Window,"In this paper, the problem of an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) approach to a target which is selected in a reference image is addressed. A robust matching algorithm is proposed to reliably project the selected point in the reference image into the live images of a quadrotor helicopter. Projective transformations are applied to the reference image to extract additional keypoints and to gain invariance to out-of-plane perspective transformations. Since the matching algorithm does not exploit the benefcial characteristics of image sequences and because its processing time is not short enough for high frame rates, a tracking algorithm is introduced. High detection rates even for image sequences with large viewpoint changes are achieved. Therefore, the presented algorithm can be used as input to a guidance algorithm for UAVs.",Drone,2019

Visual representation of airborne object on straight segment of trajectory,"Synthesis of radio images, or visual representation of airborne objects in radio systems of both active and passive ranging with inverse aperture synthesis is based on a specific model of target movement. Reception of forward and scattered by target signals from any sources that are not part of the radio visual representation system, for example, signals of the broadcasting stations of any frequency range is understood as passive ranging. When the receiving system and the emitter are spaced apart, the problem becomes multi-static. The procedure for radio imaging a uniformly rotating object in the coordinates of ranging - relative Doppler shift can be reduced to a set of relatively simple operations typical of digital signal processing. The degree of conformance of such processing to the actual situation is determined by the adequacy of the target movement assumption which involves surveillance at the site of intensive maneuvering. Another approach should be used for radio imaging the object in the straight segments of the trajectory which account for a great part of the surveillance time. In particular, wide-spread unmanned aerial vehicles are characterized by relatively small sizes and low movement rates. Consequently, the particular approach should be used for synthesis of radio images of such objects taking into account the above features. In the present paper, the method for radio imaging straight-moving aircrafts based on solving undetermined system of linear equations. The solution is proposed on the basis of the regularization method with the selection of the regularizing functional in Holder space. The results of numerical simulation show that the developed method can provide a visual representation of a large class of airborne objects in the multiposition systems with inverse aperture synthesis. Field experimental observations of the effectiveness of the method proposed are planned at the subsequent stages of work.",Drone,2019
Assessment of stability of the satellite channel of control of unmanned aerial vehicles at influence of intentional interference,"Complexes with unmanned aerial vehicles are used to monitor the earth's surface in a wide range of wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, data retransmission, cargo delivery and many other areas. At the same time, much attention is paid to the issues of over-the-horizon control of unmanned aerial vehicles via satellite radio channels, which should have high characteristics in stealth, imitability and noise immunity in relation to a complex electronic environment with the possible participation of an eventual enemy and countermeasures on its part. The relevance of the work is determined by the lack of currently departmental satellite communication systems adapted to the requirements of information retransmission between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and ground control station. The authors briefly describe the main methods of improving the stability of information transmission through communication channels exposed to intentional interference and show that the most vulnerable link in the chain of direct retransmission are commercial spacecraft, which do not have a system of forming a minimum diagram of the interference source. Based on the obtained analytical dependences, it is concluded that on the earth station - spacecraft line, when transmitting control commands, the increase in noise immunity is achieved both by the formation of a reserve of equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the earth station and by a moderate, up to 13¡­20 dB, expansion of the signal spectrum. On the line UAV - spacecraft when transmitting telemetry data due to limitations on the EIRP of the onboard terminal UAV, the main way of dealing with willful obstruction of the operation is the extension of the spectrum. The effectiveness of the measure reaches 40¡­45 dB and depends on the speed of telemetry, as well as the width of the allotted band of the satellite transponder. In this case, the importance of the correct choice of the amount of information and methods of its compression. The issues discussed in the article are of interest not only for specialists designing communication systems with UAV, but also in many cases the organization of stable channels through commercial satellite communication systems. The practical significance lies in the fact that the article can be useful for scientific and technical specialists in the field of aviation and satellite radio communications, which already at the stage of pre-contract works can lay the required parameters of radio signals for the formation of control teams, check them with the use of modern computer-aided design systems, which will provide good results in the testing and operation of complexes with unmanned aerial vehicles.",Drone,2019
Design of a complex for finding of and resistance to unmanned aerial vehicle,"A complex approach to solution of a problem consisting in lowering of perceptibility of different objects from means of finding and guidance based on unmanned aerial vehicles at millimeter wavelengths in atmospheric window is set forth in this paper. Key feature of this approach is integration in a single complex a detector of illumination with passive jamming system. Detector of illumination while operating inside atmospheric window at millimeter wavelengths gives target designation for executive subsystem. A concept of individual defensive electronic countermeasures for a given object from destruction by means of systems with active guidance consists in non-stop functioning of on-board equipment to provide detecting of radiation sources inside its operating zone along with defining of angular coordinates for this radiation sources and carrier frequency of signals. At the same time signals from radiation sources detected earlier are still being monitored. Duration of illumination exceeding ~2 ms is assessed as a threat. That means an object is captured for guiding. In that case a command for executive subsystem is formed for passive jamming. According to a concept set forth above and probable further updating of guidance for means of destruction it is reasonable to choose required value of equivalent sensitivity of finding equipment not worse than 100¡­110 W that is verified with appropriate computation. A structural pattern for such a detector of illumination that is capable to find and monitor radiation sources at millimeter wavelengths is derived from requirements to accuracy of coordinate measurements of radiation sources. Taking into account that finding of emissions generated by means of destruction must be provided throughout the whole upper hemisphere dimensions of spatial coverage area for equipment of finding should be 360 degrees for azimuth and 90 degrees for an angle of elevation. A unique antenna system consisting of 5 antenna elements (directional pattern for a single antenna element at 3-dB level is 88 degrees) is designed to solve the problem. Defense from upper hemisphere appears to be rather a complicated problem that can be solved by means of deployment of a cloud above given object. A theoretical model simulating interaction of electromagnetic wave with absorbing cloud to define required degree of attenuation for illuminating signal is elaborated. Such a model shows that if radar cross-section of a given object is 30 m2 and distance between given object and mean of destruction is 1000 m total attenuation of illuminating signal inside a cloud must be 37 dB while if radar cross-section of a given object is 300 m2 and distance between given object and mean of destruction is 1000 m total attenuation of illuminating signal inside a cloud must be 47 dB. Technical carbon of a unique recipe from JSC ?Central radio-research institute named after academician A.I. Berg? can be used to satisfy this requirements. In our system suggested in this paper both heat-emitting decoys and special noise-making ammunition are used to form a cloud from volume-distributed technical carbon. A construction of noise-making ammunition is suggested. Like one handles with heat-emitting decoy, noise-making ammunition are shot from ejection device. At a given distance from an object such ammunition are exploded forming a cloud from volume-distributed technical carbon. Size of a cloud and density of technical carbon in it can be varied by means of increasing of noise-making ammunition being shot. System described in this paper due to its universality and unique properties of technical carbon used in it is capable to provide effective defense of different objects from means of surveillance and guidance both up-to-date and designed in future. Simulations and experimental studies of distribution of particles inside a cloud versus conditions of ejection process are left for further investigations.",Drone,2019
A vision-based navigation system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),"The advances in microelectronics foster the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to be used in many civil and academic applications that require higher levels of autonomy and flight stabilization. The main objective in this paper is to provide UAVs with a robust navigation system; in order to allow the UAVs to perform complex tasks autonomously and in real-time. The proposed algorithms deal with solving the navigation problem for outdoor and indoor environments, mainly based on visual information that is captured by monocular cameras. This paper covers the topics of Pose Estimation, Navigation Guidance, and Visual Servoing. All the proposed algorithms have been verified with real flights in both indoor and outdoor environments, taking into consideration the visual conditions; such as illumination and textures. The obtained results have been validated against other systems; such as VICON motion capture system, DGPS in the case of pose estimate algorithm. In addition, the proposed algorithms have been compared with several previous works in the state of the art, and the results prove the improvement in the accuracy and the robustness of the proposed algorithms.",Drone,2019
Is Hop-by-Hop Always Better Than Store-Carry-Forward for UAV Network?,"As energy supply on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is limited, energy efficient data transmission in UAV networks would be of great concern to the researchers. Nevertheless, UAV networks exhibit strong dynamic nature compared to ordinary Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET), it is not rare that some nodes will be disjoint from other nodes from time to time. Under such circumstance, ordinary hop-byhop routing schemes can not be used anymore, for there is no route existed from source to destination. Some solutions use store-carry-forward (SCF) routing to facilitate end to end data transmission. However, when should we use SCF routing, when we should use hop-by-hop routing if we taking energy into consideration? Is hop-by-hop routing always better than SCF? If it is good or not when the hop-by-hop routing is combined with the SCF routing? All these questions need to be answered. In this paper, we answered above questions by proposing three types of minimum energy consumption models of hop-by-hop routing, and two SCF routing models. We compared all these models and considered four tactics of combination modes for the transmissions in a rotary-wing UAV network. The researches show that two tactics have better performance than other modes in energy saving capabilities by reducing 70% at most with the hop-by-hop routing, and the transmission time of combination modes are in same scale compared with hop-by-hop routing. The two tactics are appropriate for different UAV networks respectively, in which the source UAV can or cannot get the GPS information of relay UAVs in the route. The research conclusion can also be used for the transmissions in a fixed-wing UAV network by modifying the energy consumption models of fixed wing UAV, which is different from rotary wing UAVs.",Drone,2019
An Aircraft Object Detection Algorithm Based on Small Samples in Optical Remote Sensing Image,"In recent years, remote sensing technology has developed rapidly, and the ground resolution of spaceborne optical remote sensing images has reached the sub-meter range, providing a new technical means for aircraft object detection. Research on aircraft object detection based on optical remote sensing images is of great significance for military object detection and recognition. However, spaceborne optical remote sensing images are difficult to obtain and costly. Therefore, this paper proposes the aircraft detection algorithm, itcan detect aircraft objects with small samples. Firstly, this paper establishes an aircraft object dataset containing weak and small aircraft objects. Secondly, the detection algorithm has been proposed to detect weak and small aircraft objects. Thirdly, the aircraft detection algorithm has been proposed to detect multiple aircraft objects of varying sizes. There are 13,324 aircraft in the test set. According to the method proposed in this paper, the f1 score can achieve 90.44%. Therefore, the aircraft objects can be detected simply and efficiently by using the method proposed. It can effectively detect aircraft objects and improve early warning capabilities.",Early warning aircraft,2020
Collaborative Solutions for Interference Management in GNSS-Based Aircraft Navigation,"Nowadays, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technology is not the primary means of navigation for civil aviation and Air Traffic Control, but its role is increasing. Consequently, the vulnerabilities of GNSSs to Radio Frequency Interference, including the dangerous intentional sources of interference (i.e., jamming and spoofing), raise concerns and special attention also in the aviation field. This panorama urges for figuring out effective solutions able to cope with GNSS interference and preserve safety of operations. In the frame of a Single European Sky Air traffic management Research (SESAR) Exploratory Research initiative, a novel, effective, and affordable concept of GNSS interference management for civil aviation has been developed. This new interference management concept is able to raise early warnings to the on-board navigation system about the detection of interfering signals and their classification, and then to estimate the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of the source of interference allowing the adoption of appropriate countermeasures against the individuated source. This paper describes the interference management concept and presents the on-field tests which allowed for assessing the reached level of performance and confirmed the applicability of this approach to the aviation applications.",Early warning aircraft,2020
Using Evolutionary Algorithms for the Scheduling of Aircrew on Airborne Early Warning and Control System,"Equipped with an advanced radar and other electronic systems mounted on its body, Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS) enables the airspace to be monitored from medium to long distances and facilitates effective control of friendly aircraft. To operate the complex equipment and fulfill its critical functions, AWACS has a specialised flight and mission crew, all of whom are extensively trained in their respective roles. For mission accomplishment and effective use of resources, tasks should be scheduled, and individuals should be assigned to missions appropriately. In this paper, we implemented evolutionary algorithms for scheduling aircrew on AWACS and propose a novel approach using Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a special encoding strategy and modified genetic operations tailored to the problem. The objective is to assign aircrew to various AWACS tasks such as flights, simulator sessions, ground training classes and other squadron duties while aiming to maximise combat readiness and minimise operational costs. The presented approach is applied to several test instances consisting notional weekly schedules of Turkish Boeing 737 AEW&C Peace Eagle AWACS Base, generated similar to real-world examples. To test the algorithm and evaluate solution performance, experiments have been conducted on a novel scheduling software called AWACS Crew Scheduling (ACS), developed as a test bed. Computational results reveal that presented GA approach proves to be quite successful in solving the AWACS Crew Scheduling Problem and exhibits superior performance when compared to manual methods.",Early warning aircraft,2020
Research on dynamic evaluation model and early warning technology of anti-sliding risk for the airport pavement,"The contact between tread rubber and pavement surface texture has significant impact on the sliding state during the ultra-high velocity takeoff and landing process of aircraft. Their respective characteristics and coupling effect provide the material basis and essential source for the tire-road friction. In this study, the Fourier transform theory and fractal theory were used to derive the power spectrum approximation formula for pavement surface. Based on the fractal characteristics of surface texture and the viscoelastic properties of tread rubber by testing and analysis, the anti-sliding risk model of airport pavement under dry and slippery condition were established with taking friction coefficient as evaluation standard. Specifically, the surface texture information of the pavement surface was obtained by using a three-dimensional surface measuring instrument called InfiniteFocus. The sensitivity of the pavement texture parameters, tread rubber parameters and external environment to the friction coefficient was calculated by model, and the correctness of the model was verified by DF test. Finally, based on the theoretical model, one kind of dynamic early warning technology of anti-sliding risk for airport pavement was developed. The specific conclusions for this study are as follows: Asphalt mixture with larger particle size and wider texture range can improve the anti-sliding performance of the airport pavement; Under high velocity conditions, the shorter the tread rubber relaxation time is, the stronger the anti-sliding performance of pavement is, and the smaller the influence of compressive stress on the anti-sliding performance is; With the increase of velocity, the anti-sliding performance of pavement decreases rapidly in the beginning, and the downward trend slows down after 200 km/h; The presence of water film on the pavement surface will significantly reduce the anti-sliding performance of pavement and increase the risk during aircraft taking off and landing; The DF test proves that the anti-sliding risk model established in this paper is reasonable.

Stealthy movement of aerial object along rectilinear paths in the onboard Doppler radar station detection zone,"Onboard radar stations operating in the pulse- Doppler mode show the characteristic feature in the detection zone. This feature consists in the fact that in every point of the detection zone the aircraft has a sector of directions moving along wich it not detected by the onboard Doppler radar. This sector is called the sector of invisible motion directions of the aircraft. Due to these features, there are stealthy paths allowing an aircraft stays non-detected by Doppler radar station, such as radar station of an airborne early warning aircraft, while moving along them. The majority of stealthy trajectories is curvilinear with variable curvature. The article deals with the study of the rectilinear paths of the aircraft stealthy movement in the onboard Doppler radar station detection zone. It was established that any aerial object position relative to the early warning aircraft might be the start of the rectilinear stealthy path at the appropriate selection of direction of movement. An equation to determine the stealthy movement duration along the rectilinear path depending on the aircraft initial position and its direction of movement was obtained. Areas in the detection zone of the pulse-Doppler radar station to which the aerial object may enter, moving along the rectilinear stealth paths, were plotted. Their shapes and sizes depending on the aerial object position and motion parameters relative to the radar station were studied. Conditions of the unlimited time duration of movement along the stealthy paths, and conditions of the rectilinear stealthy paths for the aerial object outgoing to the onboard Doppler radar station location were found.",Early warning aircraft,2019

Fuel weight estimates of military turbo-propeller transport aircraft,"This article presents a semi-empirical model for fuel weight estimates based on mission requirements (i.e. payload and range), with the operating empty weight as parameter. The model applies to military turboprop transport aircraft, and is based on actual aircraft data. It is particularly suited for conceptual and preliminary design since it relies on the operating empty weight as sole parameter. The model is validated so it forms a sound and accurate alternative to the Breguet range equation. Empirical correlations are also proposed for the dependance upon the gross weight of the specific range and the fuel flow rate, along a flight at constant cruise altitude.

The HiVision mm-wave radar for enhanced vision systems in civil and,"This paper presents a guideline to meet the requirements of forward looking sensors of an Enhanced Vision System (EVS) for both military and civil transport aircraft. It gives an update of a previous publication [1] with special respect to airborne application. For civil transport aircraft an imaging mm-wave radar is proposed as the vision sensor for an enhanced vision system. For military air transport an additional high-performance weather radar should be combined with the mm-wave radar to enable advanced situational awareness, e.g. spot-SAR or air to air operation. For tactical navigation ( e.g. low level night operations and real-time correlation with electronic maps! the mm-wave radar is useful due to its ranging capabilities. To meet these requirements the HiVision radar was developed and tested, It uses a robust concept of electronic beam steering and will meet the strict price constraints of transport aircraft. Advanced image processing and high frequency techniques are currently developed to enhance the performance of both the radar image and integration techniques. The advantageous FMCW waveform even enables a sensor with low probability of intercept (LPI)) and a high resitance against jammer. The 1997 highlight will be the optimizing of the sensor and night trials with an enhanced radar demonstrator.",Transport aircraft,1997
"Influence of layup, stacking sequence and loading rate on energy absorption of tension-absorber joints","Tension-absorber joints are bolted joints designed to absorb energy in a survivable crash landing, through an extended version of bearing failure. They have been proposed for use in future transport aircraft narrow-body composite fuselages. Herein, the influence of layup (percentage of each ply orientation), stacking sequence (exact location of each ply) and loading rate, on energy absorption is examined. Quasi-static and dynamic (3 m/s) tests are performed on pin-loaded IM7/8552 carbon-fibre/epoxy laminates. Seven layups and 11 stacking sequences are tested, with key variables being the percentage of 0 degrees plies (from 12.5% to 62.5%), the position of the 0 degrees plies, and the changes in orientation at ply interfaces. Performance measures include ultimate bearing strength (UBS), mass-specific energy absorption (SEA) and crush load efficiency (CLE). Computed tomography is used to examine damage progression in the quasi-static tests. It is found that the most important factor in maximising SEA is having small changes in orientation at ply interfaces. This is even more important than 0 degrees content. A laminate with only 12.5% 0 degrees plies, performed remarkably well due to its low changes in ply orientation. Laminates with a high SEA tend to have a low UBS. Highest UBS was for quasi-isotropic laminates. Increased loading rate results in increased UBS but decreased SEA. The results allow selection of a stacking sequence with a desired combination of UBS and SEA, and provide a valuable database for validation of composites damage models.",Transport aircraft,2021
A domain-specific language to design false data injection tests for air traffic control systems,"The ADS-B-automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast-technology requires aircraft to broadcast their position and velocity periodically. As compared to legacy radar technologies, coupled with alarming cyber security issues (the ADS-B protocol provides no encryption nor identification), the reliance on aircraft to communicate this surveillance information exposes air transport to new cyber security threats, and especially to FDIAs-false data injection attacks-where an attacker modifies, blocks, or emits fake ADS-B messages to dupe controllers and surveillance systems. This paper is part of an ongoing research initiative toward the generation of FDIA test scenarios and focuses on supporting the test design activity, i.e., supporting ATC experts to meticulously craft test cases in order to assess the resilience of surveillance systems against FDIAs. To achieve this goal, we propose a complete and powerful domain-specific language (DSL), close to natural language, that provides a large expressiveness to support ATC business experts in creating FDIA's test scenarios. We demonstrate the design capabilities of this approach and its productivity gain with respect to manually creating the FDIAs test scenarios.",Transport aircraft,2021
"Colonial planning of Nairobi airports, 1933-1953","Most published histories of airport planning relate to decisions taken autonomously by national or local authorities on continents such as North America and Europe. Elsewhere, such as Africa, colonial governments had a large role in airport planning and provision. Using official government records at archives in Nairobi and London, this paper traces the layered and convoluted decision-making processes behind Britain's planning of airports in Kenya's capital city. Government ministries in London, and the British national airline, wanted new facilities in East Africa for post-War civil aircraft, but were unable to agree on which agency would bear what share of the cost. Kenya's own colonial authorities contested the need for and affordability of the colonial project. Disputes proceeded in a fog of engineering and financial assumptions and estimates. In 1953, approval of Nairobi's third - and current - international airport ended eight years of British-mediated surveys, negotiation and indecision about land and infrastructure on the urban edge.",Transport aircraft,2021
Numerical Study of Fluidic Thrust Vector Control Using Dual Throat Nozzle,"Compared to a variety of mechanical vectoring nozzles, fluidic vectoring nozzles possess more research value nowadays. The dual throat nozzle is gradually developing into an outstanding technology to handle supersonic and hypersonic aircraft deflections. Three-dimensional, steady, compressible, and viscous flows in rectangular dual throat nozzles are numerically investigated by resolving Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model. Computational fluid dynamics results are verified against the existing experimental data, where a good consistency is gained. The impacts of nozzle pressure ratio, injection-to-mainstream momentum flux ratio, and setup angle of the slot injector on the systemic performance are examined. Useful conclusions are summarized for engineering designers. Firstly, pitching angles decline along with an increasing nozzle pressure ratio, while systemic thrust ratio and thrust efficiency increase. Secondly, thrust vector angles enlarge with an increase of the injection-to-mainstream momentum flux ratio, whereas both systemic thrust ratio and thrust efficiency decay. Finally, the setup angle of the slot injector impacts the systemic performance remarkably. Although the pitching angle for the setup angle of 120 degrees is highest, comprehensive characteristics in terms of systemic thrust efficiency and systemic thrust ratio for the setup angle of 150 degrees are more excellent.",Transport aircraft,2021
Aerodynamic performance of profiled endwalls with upstream slot purge flow in a linear turbine cascade having pressure side separation,"In aeroengines, purge flow directly fed from the compressor (which bypasses the combustor) is introduced through the disk space between blade rows to prevent the hot ingress. Higher quantity of purge gas fed through the wheel space can provide additional thermal protection to the passage endwall and blade surfaces. However, the interaction of purge flow with the mainstream flow leads to higher secondary losses. Secondary losses inside a turbine blade passage can be reduced effectively by endwall contouring. This paper presents computational investigation on the influence of non-axisymmetric endwall contouring over endwall secondary flow modification in the presence of purge flow with the pressure side bubble (PSB). The experimental analysis was conducted for the base case without purge and base case with purge (BCP) configurations having flat endwalls. The total pressure loss coefficient and exit yaw angle deviation were measured with the help of a five-hole pressure probe. Static pressure distribution over the blade midspan was obtained by 16 channel Scanivalve. Aerodynamic performances of three different profiled endwalls are numerically analyzed and are compared against the BCP configuration. The effects of different contoured endwall geometries on endwall static pressure distribution and secondary kinetic energy were also discussed. Analysis shows that in the first contoured endwall configuration (EC1), the formation of stagnation zones at a contour valley close to the suction surface causes the exit total pressure loss coefficient to increase. The shifting of the contour valley near to the pressure surface (EC2 configuration) has resulted in local acceleration of the diverted pressure side leg of the horseshoe vortex over the hump toward the end of the passage. In the third configuration (EC3 configuration), reduced valley depth and optimum hump height have effectively redistributed the endwall pitchwise pressure gradient. The increased static pressure coefficient at the endwall near to the pressure surface has eliminated the PSB formation. In addition, computational results of unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations are obtained for analyzing transient behavior of PSB, with more emphasis on its migration on the pressure surface and transport across the blade passage. The additional work done by the mainstream fluid to transport the low momentum PSB fluid has caused higher aerodynamic penalty at the blade exit region. In this viewpoint, the implementation of contoured endwalls has shown beneficial effects by eliminating the PSB and related secondary vortices. At 27% of axial chord downstream of the blade trailing edge, a 4.1% reduction in the total pressure loss coefficient was achieved with endwall contouring.",Transport aircraft,2021
Disruption in the air: The impact of flight rerouting due to air traffic control strikes,"When airspace sectors are disrupted airlines have the decision to either cancel, delay or reroute scheduled flights. The aim of this paper is to estimate the additional kilometres flown due to rerouted flights during air traffic control strikes. We use detailed flight-level data and information on over sixty strikes in European airspace between 2015 and 2017. We combine a difference -indifference approach with statistical matching procedures to address that strikes do not occur randomly over time. Our estimates show that strikes significantly decrease the horizontal trajectory efficiency of operated flights, aggregating to 4.7 million additional aircraft kilometres over the sample period. This equals about 13.4 kilotonnes of additional fuel consumption and 42.2 kilotonnes of CO2-emissions. Further results suggest that these inefficiencies can be mitigated by measures that preserve continuity of service for overflights during disruptions.",Transport aircraft,2021
Flight Dynamics of Transport Aircraft Equipped with Flared-Hinge Folding Wingtips,"This paper studies the influence of flared-hinge folding wingtips on the aerodynamic derivatives and flight dynamics of a narrow-body transport aircraft. In addition, the influence of fold angle, hinge-line angle (flare angle), and wingtip size on wing loading is assessed. The Tornado vortex lattice method is used for aerodynamic predictions and to estimate the stability and control derivatives. First, the aircraft is assumed rigid, and different hinge angles, fold angles, and wingtip sizes are considered. Then, structural flexibility is considered by coupling Tornado with a linear structural finite element solver to facilitate quasi-static aeroelastic analysis. The quasi-static deflections method is used to study the flight dynamics of the flexible aircraft. The effect of the flared-hinge folding wingtips on the longitudinal and lateral-directional flight dynamic modes of the rigid and the flexible aircraft is compared and contrasted. Furthermore, the variations of longitudinal trim settings and roll response with flared-hinge folding wingtips are assessed.",Transport aircraft,2021
Prediction of aircraft trajectory and the associated fuel consumption using covariance bidirectional extreme learning machines,"Accurate prediction of the aircraft trajectory and associated fuel consumption has become an important research topic owing to the increasing importance of air traffic management. Currently, trajectory prediction and fuel estimation are usually accomplished via complex mathematical energy-balance methods. In these methods, the prediction error could get increased due to the possible usage of global values and outdated database, resulting from that most of the information regarding aircraft operations is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a covariance bidirectional extreme learning machine (CovB-ELM) for predicting aircraft trajectories and estimating fuel consumption. The selection of randomly generated parameters for the hidden unit, such as the input weight and bias, to improve the accuracy and numerical stability of the extreme learning machine (ELM), is an open problem. The fundamental idea behind the proposed method is to maximise the covariance between the hidden unit and network errors through partially updating the hidden-unit parameters randomly generated in bidirectional ELM so that the output weight norm value is minimised and the convergence gets improved. The merits of the proposed CovBELM are demonstrated by the experiments involving regression problems and international airline historically flight data, which suggests that the CovB-ELM outperforms, in terms of generalisation performance, several existing methods, e.g., airline mathematical approach, backpropagation neural network, and constructive ELM methods.",Transport aircraft,2021
Measurement and identification of azimuthal current in an RF plasma thruster employing a time-varying magnetic field,"We report two-dimensional temporally resolved measurements of the magnetic field and the azimuthal current in a radio-frequency plasma thruster with a time-varying magnetic field. The measured azimuthal current cannot be explained by the classical cross-field transport theory, which has been used in modeling of inductive electrodeless plasma thrusters; rather, it is fairly close to the estimated current using parallel electrical conductivity. In the analysis in the collisionless limit, the comparison of the measured azimuthal current and the diamagnetic current implies the non-negligible contribution of the azimuthal electron E x B drift current in the azimuthal current, in contrast with the case of conventional helicon plasma thrusters. This result indicates the establishment of the strong in-plane perpendicular electric field, as observed in the previous experiment [H. Sekine, H. Koizumi, and K. Komurasaki, Phys. Plasmas 27, 103513 (2020)]. Based on the experimental results, we build a hypothesis on the wall-charging-induced in-plane perpendicular electric field and the in-plane current-free condition. By analyzing the electron momentum equation under this condition, the electrical conductivity in the azimuthal direction agrees to the parallel conductivity, explaining the present result well.",Transport aircraft,2021
Numerical Simulations on Unsteady Nonlinear Transonic Airfoil Flow,"Large-amplitude excitations need to be considered for gust load analyses of transport aircraft in cruise flight conditions. Nonlinear amplitude effects in transonic flow are, however, only marginally taken into account. The present work aims at closing this gap by means of systematic unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. The RAE2822 airfoil is analyzed for a variety of sinusoidal gust excitations at different transonic Mach numbers. Responses are evaluated with respect to lift and moment coefficients, their derivatives and the unsteady shock motion. A strong dependency on inflow Mach number and excitation frequency is observed. Generally, amplitude effects decrease with lower Mach numbers or higher excitation frequencies. The unsteady nonlinear simulations predict lower maximum lift values and lower lift and moment derivatives compared to their linear counterparts for lower frequencies in combination with large-amplitude excitations. For the mid-frequency range, trends are not as clear. Additionally, it is shown that the variables of harmonic distortion and maximum shock motion might not be reasonable indicators to predict a nonlinear response.",Transport aircraft,2021
Modeling of the octave sound spectrum emitted by the F-16 Block 52+aircraft during takeoff,"The fundamental problem in the battle against aircraft noise on areas surrounding airports is to determine the sound pressure level in the audible frequency range as well as the composition of the noise spectrum. Today, we have tools enabling the modeling of the influence of noise on the environment. However, these models allow only a quantitative assessment. The authors propose to develop a model that enables an analysis of the sound frequency structure in airport nearby areas. Several noise measurements during the F-16 Block 52+ aircraft takeoffs were conducted using a unique recording system. Based on the sound data processing and proposed analysis, the novel octave sound spectrum (between 16 and 16000 Hz) model in distance function (till 1600 m) was elaborated. Moreover, the model was statistically verified and validated by more noise measurements which has proven high results efficiency (the residuum values do not exceed 3 dB).",Transport aircraft,2021
Mechanism analysis of a main landing gear of transporting aircraft: A design learning perspective,"The landing gear lifetime is estimated based on the safe-life design concept and its design requires thorough calculations. The individual parts and sub-assemblies must be sensibly designed to function safely and efficiently for the specified design lifetime without failure. In a design process of a main landing gear system, the kinematics/mechanisms analysis shall be first carried out as a primary task for feasibility of the gear retraction/extension with the satisfactory link paths. This paper presents the analytical kinematics analysis of a complex mechanism involving multiple four-bar linkages with multiple coupler points of the main landing gear (MLG) of CN-235 aircraft. The kinematics analyses were performed in order to figure out the overall link positions of the main landing gear mechanism and make scenarios of a deformed component from its designed geometry for possibilities of a lock failed position.",Transport aircraft,2021
"Nanoscale ""Earthquake"" Effect Induced by Thin Film Surface Acoustic Waves as a New Strategy for Ice Protection","Ice accretion often poses serious operational and safety challenges in a wide range of industries, such as aircraft, wind turbines, power transmission cables, oil field exploration and production, as well as marine transport. Great efforts have been expended to research and develop viable solutions for ice prevention. Effective ice protection techniques, however, have yet to be developed. Ice prevention measures that are currently available often consume significant amounts of de-icing chemicals or energy, and these approaches are expensive to operate and have long-term economic and environmental impacts. Here, a new ice protective strategy based on thin film surface acoustic waves (SAWs) is proposed that generates: nanoscale ""earthquake""-like vibrations, acoustic streaming, and acousto-heating effects, directly at the ice-structure interface, which actively and effectively delays ice nucleation and weakens ice adhesion on the structure surface. Compared with the conventional electro-thermal de-icing method, the SAW approach demonstrates much-improved energy efficiency for ice-removal. The potential for the dual capability of autonomous ice monitoring and removing functions using the SAW generation elements as transducers is also explored.",Transport aircraft,2021

Aviation-Associated Spatial Disorientation and Incidence of Visual Illusions Survey in Military Pilots,"ObjectiveThe lack of information on active military pilots has led to the present study, which aimed to analyze the sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation and the incidence of visual illusions of fighter and transport military pilots through a post-flight survey. Background: The advance of aeronautics has led to further aircraft developments, increasing heights and speeds which increase the psychophysiological demands, thus leading to greater incidence of spatial disorientation and visual illusions.Methods60 male pilots with large professional experience (1012 h +/- 250 accumulated flying hours) between 7 and 18 years in their respective units and experience in international missions in the current conflict areas as Lebanon, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, were subjected to a post-flight visual experience questionnaire.ResultsOur findings suggest that transport pilots tend to present significant higher disorientation situations than fighter pilots, while fighter pilots presented greater sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation but experimented more visual illusions.ConclusionThese differences are related with the demands of the different aircrafts used by each pilot, thus specific, individualized and larger simulated training sessions in simulated environments are suggested. Further research should focus on the analysis of peripheral and central fatigue as constructs that may help to the appearance of greater spatial disorientation and visual illusions.",Transport aircraft,2021
Assessing Desert Dust Indirect Effects on Cloud Microphysics through a Cloud Nucleation Scheme: A Case Study over the Western Mediterranean,"In this study, the performance and characteristics of the advanced cloud nucleation scheme of Fountoukis and Nenes, embedded in the fully coupled Weather Research and Forecasting/Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model, are investigated. Furthermore, the impact of dust particles on the distribution of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and the way they modify the pattern of the precipitation are also examined. For the simulation of dust particle concentration, the Georgia Tech Goddard Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport of Air Force Weather Agency (GOCART-AFWA) is used as it includes components for the representation of dust emission and transport. The aerosol activation parameterization scheme of Fountoukis and Nenes has been implemented in the six-class WRF double-moment (WDM6) microphysics scheme, which treats the CCN distribution as a prognostic variable, but does not take into account the concentration of dust aerosols. Additionally, the presence of dust particles that may facilitate the activation of CCN into cloud or rain droplets has also been incorporated in the cumulus scheme of Grell and Freitas. The embedded scheme is assessed through a case study of significant dust advection over the Western Mediterranean, characterized by severe rainfall. Inclusion of CCN based on prognostic dust particles leads to the suppression of precipitation over hazy areas. On the contrary, precipitation is enhanced over areas away from the dust event. The new prognostic CCN distribution improves in general the forecasting skill of the model as bias scores, the root mean square error (RMSE), false alarm ratio (FAR) and frequencies of missed forecasts (FOM) are limited when modelled data are compared against satellite, LIDAR and aircraft observations.",Transport aircraft,2020
Separation safety analysis using CFD simulation and remeshing,"The work is aimed to simulate the separation process of a GBU-31 bomb and empty 370 gal fuel tank from an aircraft, using the 6 - Degree Of Freedom (6-DOF) procedure and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code for body movement. The procedure has an ability to simulate the sequential release from the joints, which is necessary for the lightweight tank separation, in order to avoid a collision with an aircraft. A set of unsteady CFD simulations were calculated. Both the in-house designed 6-DOF procedure and the CFD simulation settings were validated using the wind tunnel experiment data and a Covert criterion for safety separation. Similar approach could be used to analyze the separation of other kinds of external stores and during design the deployment of anti radar chaff, flares or ejection seats. This kind of research is extremely important in the way to improve safety level of flight operations and avoid hazardous situations in the air.

A real-time integrated optimization of the aircraft holding time and rerouting under risk area,"Fight on-time rate is one of the key air transport industry's service quality indicators, often affected by adverse weather. In order to improve flight punctuality and reduce the impact of adverse weather on flights, a Real-time Integrated Optimization of the Aircraft Holding Time and Rerouting under Risk Area (RIOAHTR-RA) model is proposed at minimizing the total flight duration from the start point of rerouting to the end point of rerouting under adverse weather condition. In this model, the update cycle based on radar data is generally 6 min, and the position relationship between risk area and the aircraft is available and described in real time. The RIOAHTR-RA model is then solved by the distribution estimation algorithm with improved artificial potential field (IAPF) by introducing intermediate target point, relative position and relative velocity factors. Then, the optimal holding time and rerouting path for aircraft were allocated. The results are compared with the single rerouting strategy, and the effectiveness of the optimization solver with improved IAPF is evaluated. Compared with the data of the Hong Kong Observatory's forecast system, the results show that appropriate holding time before rerouting can reduce flight delays. The proposed RIOAHTR-RA model is suitable for real-time air traffic flow management.",Transport aircraft,2020
Long-Autonomy Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) for Quick Release of Ocean Minidrifters,"In this work we present an unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) designed from off-the-shelf components to release ocean minidrifters. Its endurance (similar to 1 h), payload (similar to 5 kg), offshore range (similar to 30 km), capability of operating into wind conditions of similar to 10 kt (1 kt approximate to 0.51 ms(-1)), high-precision autopilot (2-3 m), and flying altitude of similar to 500 m above sea level, along with its relatively low cost [<$5,000 (U.S. dollars)] enables quick and relatively easy oceanographic applications beyond 10 km offshore. We report here the very first successful ocean drifter releases, performed along the Baja California coast, between Tijuana and Rosarito, Mexico, and the technical details of the UAV. About 50 experiments (flights) allowed us to improve the takeoff and landing, the release tunnel for minidrifters, the cruise speed and altitude to release drifters safely, and to implement a parachute that controls the speed of the freefalling minidrifters. Quick release of up to six drifters (armed with real-time data transfer and web display) between 2 and 12 km offshore were performed at similar to 500 m above sea level, during a single flight in under 15 min, as opposed to classic techniques using boats or ships that, although can transport much more weight, can take several hours, use more human resources, and increase cost. Here we propose a novel open-source technique that can be used as a simplified method for scientific ocean measurements, as a quick-response emergency tool to map spills or for search and rescue.",Transport aircraft,2020
Simulation of Cosmic Radiation Transport Inside Aircraft for Safety Applications,"During the flight, an aircraft is submitted to a radiation environment composed of cosmic-ray-induced particles (CRIP) of which neutrons are responsible for approximately 40% of the crew effective dose and are the main cause of single event effects (SEE) in avionics systems at flight altitudes. A model of Learjet aircraft was developed on Monte Carlo simulation using the MCNPX code in order to detail the CRIP field inside the aircraft. The radiation source modeling was previously developed by a computational platform that simulates the energy and angular distributions of the CRIP along the atmosphere. In this article, we determined the variation of the neutron radiation field in several positions inside the aircraft at 11- and 18-km altitudes and for both equatorial and polar regions. The results suggest that the maximum variation of neutron fluence rate between different positions inside the aircraft shows a tendency of higher differences for a lower energy threshold (thermal and E > 1 MeV) in comparison with those differences for a higher energy threshold (E > 10 MeV). Moreover, the angular distribution results show relevant differences between positions inside aircraft, mainly for thermal neutrons close to the fuel. The general tendency is to enhance these discrepancies for devices with new technologies, due to their lower energy threshold for SEE occurrences.",Transport aircraft,2020
System Identification and LQR Controller Design with Incomplete State Observation for Aircraft Trajectory Tracking,"This paper presents a controller design process for an aircraft tracking problem when not all states are available. In the study, a nonlinear-transport aircraft simulation model was used and identified through Maximum Likelihood Principle and Extended Kalman Filter. The obtained mathematical model was used to design a Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with optimal weighting matrices when not all states are measured. The nonlinear aircraft simulation model with LQR controller tracking abilities were analyzed for multiple experiments with various noise levels. It was shown that the designed controller is robust and allows for accurate trajectory tracking. It was found that, in ideal atmospheric conditions, the tracking errors are small, even for unmeasured variables. In wind presence, the tracking errors were proportional to the wind velocity and acceptable for small and moderate disturbances. When turbulence was present in the experiment, state variable oscillations occurred that were proportional to the turbulence intensity and acceptable for small and moderate disturbances.",Transport aircraft,2020
Modeling resilience of the ATC (Air Traffic Control) sectors,"This paper develops a theoretical framework containing the methodology for assessing resilience of the ATC (Air Traffic Control) sectors affected by the impact of a given disruptive event. The resilience is considered as ability of these sectors to retain a certain level of the regular/nominal performance during the impact and fully recover relatively fast afterwards. The actually rear disruptive event is considered to be the large-scale failure of a component of the ATC facilities and equipment supporting safe, efficient, and effective air traffic. Under such conditions, different mitigating contingency measures are generally applied resulting in deteriorating the operational, economic, and environmental performance of the affected sectors while maintaining the required level of safety. This performance is represented by the indicators such as demand, capacity, traffic complexity, the ATC controller workload, aircraft/flight delays and their costs, and additional fuel consumption and related emissions of GHG (Green House Gases). The proposed methodology consists of the generic model of resilience, the analytical models for estimating the indictors of ATC sectors' performance, and the analytical models of resilience based the indicators as figures-of-merit for assessing resilience. These models are based on the practice-close mitigating contingency measures applied to the ATC sectors affected by a given disruptive event. The possible application of the proposed methodology is also elaborated.",Transport aircraft,2020
Shape memory alloy actuator with active cooling device and deflectable winglet application,"Heating and cooling time directly influence the response speed of a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuator. An SMA wire is heated quickly by electric current, however quickly cooling it to a given temperature is difficult. In this study, we proposed a pipeline-type active air convection cooling scheme, which uses compressed air as cooling airflow to achieve rapid active cooling of SMA wire actuators. We designed an SMA wire linear actuator consisting of SMA wires, a compressed air tank, an air valve, an Outlet Pipeline, an SMA Cooling Pipeline, and some other additional accessories. We established theoretical models of heat transfer under natural cooling and active convection cooling of an SMA wire. In addition, we carried out theoretical simulation and experiments on a NiTi alloy SMA wire with a diameter of 1 mm and compared the accuracy of simulation with test results. The SMA wire actuators are used for deflectable morphing winglets of aircraft wing. We designed three-dimensional numerical models of the morphing winglets that can be deflected within +/- 20 degrees and the experimental models are machined and assembled. Final test results show that active cooling time is reduced by more than 70% compared with natural cooling and the response speed is improved significantly.",Transport aircraft,2020
Study on decay characteristics of vertical four-vortex system for increasing airport capacity,"The wake vortices of an aircraft descend by self-induction that enables a pilot to identify approximate wake location based on the preceding aircraft path. A pilot taking off an aircraft can avoid a wake vortex encounter by performing early rotation and flying at or above the climb path of the preceding aircraft. Such operation results in a situation in which two wake vortices are present in the air simultaneously in close proximity. In this study, the transport and decay characteristic processes involving interactions between the wake vortex pairs formed by the preceding and the following aircraft have been analyzed. The high altitude of the following aircraft was included as initial conditions, and atmospheric turbulence conditions were applied to large eddy simulations to account for the vortex core instability and nonlinear transport and decay. The obtained results were used to identify the decay processes that induce the rapid dissipation of wake vortices such as merging into a single counter-rotating pair, rapid dissipation, and formation of a vortex ring with or without deformation of the lower vortex pair. The third process could be effectively used to adjust the take-off separation time for increasing the capacity at airports. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Two-layer adaptive augmentation for incremental backstepping flight control of transport aircraft in uncertain conditions,"Presence of uncertainties caused by unforeseen malfunctions in actuation system or changes in aircraft behaviour could lead to aircraft loss-of-control during flight. The paper presents Two-Layer Adaptive augmentation for Incremental Backstepping (TLA-IBKS) control algorithm designed for a large transport aircraft. IBKS uses angular accelerations and current control deflections to reduce the dependency on the aircraft model. However, it requires knowledge of control effectiveness. The proposed technique is capable to detect possible failures for an overactuated system. At the first layer, the system performs monitoring of a combined effectiveness and detects possible failures via an innovation process. If a problem is detected the algorithm initiates the second-layer algorithm for adaptation of effectiveness of individual control effectors. Filippov generalization for nonlinear differential equations with discontinuous right-hand sides is utilized to develop Lyapunov based tuning function adaptive law for the second layer adaptation and to prove uniform asymptotic stability of the resultant closed-loop system. Conducted simulation manifests that if the input-affine property of the IBKS is violated, e.g., in severe conditions with a combination of multiple failures, the IBKS can lose stability. Meanwhile, the proposed TLA-IBKS algorithm demonstrates improved stability and tracking performance. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",Transport aircraft,2020
An empirical model of airline fleet standardization in Brazil: Assessing the dynamic impacts of mergers with an events study,"This paper develops an empirical model to investigate the strategic fleet management practices in the air transport industry regarding airline fleet standardization (AFS). We conduct an econometric analysis of the key drivers of AFS in Brazil and study the dynamic effects of five merger events. We find evidence of a significant drop in AFS following most of the consolidations, which is gradually reversed during the post-merger integration efforts. Additionally, except for the major full-service carrier, all other airlines had an estimated overall trend toward more intense fleet standardization over the entire period, revealing a stronger preference for seeking cost competitiveness over market opportunity when facing competition in the market.",Transport aircraft,2020
Towards In-Flight Transfer of Payloads Between Multirotors,"Multirotor unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are often used to transport a variety of payloads. However, the maximum time that the cargo can remain airborne is limited by the flight endurance of the UAS. In this letter, we present a novel approach for two multirotors to transfer a payload between them in-air, while keeping the payload aloft and stationary. Our framework is built on a visual-feedback and grasping pipeline that enables one UAS to grasp the payload held by another, thereby allowing the UASs to act as swappable carriers. By connecting the payload outwards along a single rigid link, and allowing the UASs to maneuver about it, we let the payload remain online while it is transferred to a different carrier. Furthermore, building entirely on monocular vision, the approach does not rely on precise extrinsic localization systems. We demonstrate our proposed strategy in a variety of indoor and GPS-free outdoor experiments, and explore the range of operating limits for our system.",Transport aircraft,2020
Decision framework for the integration of RPAS in non-segregated airspace,"The integration of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) in non-segregated airspace is one of the forthcoming challenges in aviation. This paper develops a decision framework to determine the airways where RPAS should fly. The methodology defines three types of indicators: (1) static indicators based on the geometry of the airspace; (2) dynamic indicators based on the air traffic features; and (3) mixed indicators that combine both static and dynamic indicators. These indicators appraise the airspace state basic elements as airways and crossing points. The decision framework seeks to detect which airways and air corridors - specific Flight Levels (FLs) of an airway - can be fully segregated for the use of RPAS, as well as the airways that favour the integration of RPAS but increasing the risk level. The decision framework is applied to the Spanish upper airspace LECMZGZ from FL 250 to 300. Results conclude there are no airways that permit their use as segregated airways. However, two air corridors at FL 270 allow the segregated integration of RPAS. Moreover, the decision framework detects the airways that favour the integration of RPAS although they would have an impact on the risk level.",Transport aircraft,2020
Validation of XCO2 and XCH4 retrieved from a portable Fourier transform spectrometer with those from in situ profiles from aircraft-borne instruments,"Column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) measured by a solar viewing portable Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS, EM27/SUN) have been characterized and validated by comparison using in situ profile measurements made during the transfer flights of two aircraft campaigns: Korea-United States Air Quality Study (KORUS-AQ) and Effect of Megacities on the Transport and Transformation of Pollutants at Regional and Global Scales (EMeRGe). The aircraft flew over two Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites: Rikubetsu, Japan (43.46 degrees N, 143.77 degrees E), for the KORUS-AQ campaign and Burgos, Philippines (18.53 degrees N, 120.65 degrees E), for the EMeRGe campaign. The EM27/SUN was deployed at the corresponding TCCON sites during the overflights. The mole fraction profiles obtained by the aircraft over Rikubetsu differed between the ascending and the descending flights above approximately 8 km for both CO2 and CH4. Because the spatial pattern of tropopause heights based on potential vorticity values from the ERA5 reanalysis shows that the tropopause height over the Rikubetsu site was consistent with the descending profile, we used only the descending profile to compare with the EM27/SUN data. Both the XCO2 and XCH4 derived from the descending profiles over Burgos were lower than those from the ascending profiles. Output from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model indicates that higher CO2 for the ascending profile originated in central Luzon, an industrialized and densely populated region about 400 km south of the Burgos TCCON site. Air masses observed with the EM27/SUN overlap better with those from the descending aircraft profiles than those from the ascending aircraft profiles with respect to their properties such as origin and atmospheric residence times. Consequently, the descending aircraft profiles were used for the comparison with the EM27/SUN data. The EM27/SUN XCO2 and XCH4 data were derived by using the GGG2014 software without applying air-mass-independent correction factors (AICFs). The comparison of the EM27/SUN observations with the aircraft data revealed that, on average, the EM27/SUN XCO2 data were biased low by 1.22% and the EM27/SUN XCH4 data were biased low by 1.71 %. The resulting AICFs of 0.9878 for XCO2 and 0.9829 for XCH4 were obtained for the EM27/SUN. Applying AICFs being utilized for the TCCON data (0.9898 for XCO2 and 0.9765 for XCH4) to the EM27/SUN data induces an underestimate for XCO2 and an overestimate for XCH4.",Transport aircraft,2020
Model-Based Event-Triggered Sliding-Mode Control for Multi-Input Systems: Performance Analysis and Optimization.,"This article is concerned with the model-based event-triggered sliding-mode control (SMC) issue for multi-input systems, which is motivated by some existing results in a single-input case. A model-based event-triggered SMC scheme is first designed. In particular, a triggered condition is co-designed with SMC to achieve the reachability condition of a specified sliding surface. Thus, it can effectively mitigate the burden of data communication, and also eliminate the effect of the matched external disturbance and the model uncertainties in both system and input. For ensuring the stability of the model dynamics and the resulting sliding-mode dynamics simultaneously, an auxiliary disturbance input is introduced to the nominal model by compensating the switching term of the designed SMC law. Furthermore, the positive lower bound for the minimum interevent time is analyzed to ensure the feasibility of the proposed approach. To illustrate the proposed model-based event-triggered SMC approach from a practical viewpoint, two design problems to maximize the system robustness and performance are proposed, respectively. The nontrivial optimization problems are then solved by a genetic algorithm (GA). Finally, jet transport aircraft is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results and algorithm.",Transport aircraft,2020
The influence of yaw on the unsteady surface pressures over a two-wheeled landing-gear model,"Landing-gear noise is an increasing issue for transport aircraft. A key determinant of the phenomenon is the surface pressure field. Previous studies have described this field when the oncoming flow is perfectly aligned with the gear. In practice, there may be a cross-flow component; here its influence is investigated experimentally for a generic, two-wheel, landing-gear model. It is found that yaw angles as small as 5 degrees cause significant changes in both overall flow topology and unsteady surface pressures. Most notably, on the outboard face of the leeward wheel, large-scale separation replaces predominantly attached flow behind a leading-edge separation bubble. The effect on unsteady surface pressures includes marked shifts in the content at frequencies in the audible range, implying that yaw is an important parameter for landing-gear noise, and that purely unyawed studies may not be fully representative of the problem.",Transport aircraft,2020
Drone for medical products transportation in maternal healthcare A systematic review and framework for future research,"Introduction: Medical products transportation has become an important research topic requiring multidisciplinary collaboration among experts in medicine, engineering, and health economics. Current modes of transportation are unable to overcome the limited settings in maternal healthcare, particularly during the event of obstetric emergencies. The drone is a promising medical product aerial transportation (MedART) that holds an enormous potential for delivery of medical supplies in the healthcare system. We conducted a systematic review to examine scientific evidence of positive impact of drone transportation on maternal health. Methods: The following electronic databases were searched from inception to July 2019: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and EMBASE. The report was made in accordance with the principles of PRISMA guidelines. The search terms used were related to drones including unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned aerial system (UAS), and related to obstetric/maternal including obstetric emergencies and postpartum hemorrhage. Studies were selected if the intervention used were drones, and if any direct or indirect maternal health indicators were reported. Meta-analysis was not done throughout the study in view of the anticipated heterogeneity of each study. Results: Our initial search yielded a total of 244 relevant publications, from which 236 were carried forward for a title and abstract screening. After careful examination, only two were included for systematic synthesis. Among the reasons for exclusion were irrelevance to maternal health purpose, and irrelevance to drone applications in healthcare. An updated search yielded one additional study that was also included. Overall, two studies assessed drones for blood products delivery, and one study used drones to transport blood samples. Conclusion: A significant deficiency was found in the number of reported studies analyzing mode of medical products transportation and adaptation of drones in maternal healthcare. Future drone research framework should focus on maternal healthcare-specific drone applications in order to reap benefits in this area.",Transport aircraft,2020
Aerosol data assimilation in the MOCAGE chemical transport model during the TRAQA/ChArMEx campaign: lidar observations,"This paper presents the first results about the assimilation of CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) extinction coefficient measurements onboard the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite in the MOCAGE (MOdele de Chimie Atmospherique a Grande Echelle) chemistry transport model of Meteo-France. This assimilation module is an extension of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) assimilation system already presented by Sic et al. (2016). We focus on the period of the TRAQA (TRAnsport a longue distance et Qualite de l'Air dans le bassin mediterraneen) field campaign that took place during summer 2012. This period offers the opportunity to have access to a large set of aerosol observations from instrumented aircraft, balloons, satellite and ground-based stations. We evaluate the added value of CALIOP assimilation with respect to the model free run by comparing both fields to independent observations issued from the TRAQA field campaign.In this study we focus on the desert dust outbreak which happened during late June 2012 over the Mediterranean Basin (MB) during the TRAQA campaign. The comparison with the AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) AOD measurements shows that the assimilation of CALIOP lidar observations improves the statistics compared to the model free run. The correlation between AERONET and the model (assimilation) is 0.682 (0.753); the bias and the root mean square error (RMSE), due to CALIOP assimilation, are reduced from -0.063 to 0.048 and from 0.183 to 0.148, respectively.Compared to MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) AOD observations, the model free run shows an underestimation of the AOD values, whereas the CALIOP assimilation corrects this underestimation and shows a quantitative good improvement in terms of AOD maps over the MB. The correlation between MODIS and the model (assimilation) during the dust outbreak is 0.47 (0.52), whereas the bias is -0.18 (-0.02) and the RMSE is 0.36 (0.30).The comparison of in situ aircraft and balloon measurements to both modelled and assimilated outputs shows that the CALIOP lidar assimilation highly improves the model aerosol field. The evaluation with the LOAC (Light Optical Particle Counter) measurements indicates that the aerosol vertical profiles are well simulated by the direct model but with a general underestimation of the aerosol number concentration, especially in the altitude range 2-5 km. The CALIOP assimilation improves these results by a factor of 2.5 to 5.Analysis of the vertical distribution of the desert aerosol concentration shows that the aerosol dust transport event is well captured by the model but with an underestimated intensity. The assimilation of CALIOP observations allows the improvement of the geographical representation of the event within the model as well as its intensity by a factor of 2 in the altitude range 1-5 km.",Transport aircraft,2020
Experimental Investigation of Spherical Tank Slosh Dynamics with Water and Liquid Nitrogen,"Understanding, predicting, and controlling fluid slosh dynamics is critical to safety and improving the performance of liquid propulsion systems for space missions. Computational fluid dynamics simulations can be used to predict the dynamics of slosh. Experimental and numerical studies of water slosh have been conducted; however, cryogenic slosh data relevant for validating computational fluid dynamics are lacking. This paper presents the results of slosh experiments with a spherical tank without and with a ring baffle using both water and liquid nitrogen. The experiments were designed to measure forces from continuous excitation over a relevant range of frequencies and amplitudes, natural frequency, and damping parameters. Analytical models and empirical correlations for slosh damping are constructed and compared to the experimental results. An established analytical model for slosh forces is compared to the experimental results for verification purposes. Experiments with a ring baffle installed show increased damping and attenuation of maximum slosh forces. To provide the greatest utility of these data for future rocket and spacecraft missions, the results are presented in a fully nondimensional framework.",Transport aircraft,2020
Airlift Maintenance and Sustainment: The Indirect Costs,"This article aims to present and discuss a set of technical matters affecting the maintenance and sustainment cost of military transport aircraft (airlifters). An overview of the military aviation technical support system is provided, in conjunction with a high level discussion on the life cycle cost. Four technical support pillars are defined as part of this analysis: supply, restoration and upgrade, engineering and regulatory compliance. A focused discussion on airlift sustainment factors, based on past experience, is used to identify technical considerations that can be used for the evaluation of new aircraft. A number of technical considerations which are key for cost purposes are identified and mapped against the defined technical support pillars, related to engineering and technical support and airworthiness management aspects. Important practical technical considerations are identified, discussed and critiqued under an independent lens. This article can stimulate discussion of the maintenance and sustainment costs of airlifters, both within military aviation operators and the defence industry community but also within the civil aircraft maintenance industry.",Transport aircraft,2020
Towards a framework of key technologies for drones,"The potential applications for drones, especially those in manned areas or into non-segregated airspace, are currently not possible without the development and validation of certain key enabling technologies: ""detect and avoid"", ""air traffic management"", ""command and control (C2) link"", and ""security and cyber resilience"". This issue has a high impact on European innovation as identified by SESAR JU and demands R&D investments and incentives for the convergence of shared technologies and markets. In this paper, we discuss the vision of COMP4DRONES project to complement SESAR JU effort s with a particular focus on safe software and hardware drone architectures. COMP4DRONES will bear a holistically designed ecosystem ranging from application to electronic components. The ecosystem aims at supporting (1) efficient customization and incremental assurance of drone-embedded platforms, (2) safe autonomous decision making concerning individual or cooperative missions, (3) trustworthy drone-to-drone and drone-to ground communications even in presence of malicious attackers and under the intrinsic platform constraints, and (4) agile and cost-effective design and assurance of drone modules and systems.

Double layer formation and thrust generation in an expanding plasma using 1D-3V PIC simulation,"Due to large particle exhaust velocity and specific impulse, electric propulsion systems have an edge over chemical propulsion for missions targeting regions outside the Earth's atmosphere. Stationary plasma thrusters and helicon plasma thrusters (HPTs) are commonly used electric propulsion devices for a space mission. In HPTs or expanding magnetic field plasma thrusters, plasma expands from the source region to the expansion region in an externally applied expanding magnetic field. Due to plasma expansion in such a magnetic field configuration, a current free double layer is found to form, which accelerates bulk ions, and a directional ion beam is generated, which causes thrust in the opposite direction. A Particle In Cell (PIC) solver with Monte Carlo Collision (MCC) scheme which resolves the axial direction and all three velocity degrees of freedom (1D-3V PIC-MCC) that captures the 2D spatial plasma expansion effect via a 1D flux conserving model is developed to simulate an argon plasma in an expanding magnetic field. Using the 1D-3V PIC-MCC solver, double layer formation due to plasma expansion, thrust generation, and optimization of thrust studies over a large parameter set, such as fill pressure of Ar, is presented. We compare our results with a particle loss model, which is commonly used as the simplest model for HPTs.",Transport aircraft,2020
Cost Analysis of Optimized Islanded Energy Systems in a Dispersed Air Base Conflict,"The United States Air Force has implemented a dispersed air base strategy to enhance mission effectiveness for near-peer conflicts. Asset dispersal places many smaller bases across a wide geographic area, which increases resupply requirements and logistical complexity. Hybrid energy systems reduce resupply requirements through sustainable, off-grid energy production. This paper presents a novel hybrid energy renewable delivery system (HERDS) model capable of (1) selecting the optimal hybrid energy system design that meets demand at the lowest net present cost and (2) optimizing the delivery of the selected system using existing Air Force cargo aircraft. The novelty of the model's capabilities is displayed using Clark Air Base, Philippines as a case study. The HERDS model selected an optimal configuration consisting of a 676-kW photovoltaic array, an 1846-kWh battery system, and a 200-kW generator. This hybrid energy system predicts a 54% reduction in cost and an 88% reduction in fuel usage, as compared to the baseline Air Force system. The HERDS model is expected to support planners in their ongoing efforts to construct cost-effective sites that minimize the transport and logistic requirements associated with remote installations. Additionally, the results of this paper may be appropriate for broader civilian applications.",Transport aircraft,2020
Validating CFD Predictions of Flow over an Escarpment Using Ground-Based and Airborne Measurement Devices,"Micrometeorological observations from a tower, an eddy-covariance (EC) station and an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) at the WINSENT test-site are used to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, driven by a mesoscale model. The observation site is characterised by a forested escarpment in a complex terrain. A two-day measurement campaign with a flow almost perpendicular to the escarpment is analysed. The first day is dominated by high wind speeds, while, on the second one, calm wind conditions are present. Despite some minor differences, the flow structure, analysed in terms of horizontal wind speeds, wind direction and inclination angles shows similarities for both days. A real-time strategy is used for the CFD validation with the UAS measurement, where the model follows spatially and temporally the aircraft. This strategy has proved to be successful. Stability indices such as the potential temperature and the bulk Richardson number are calculated to diagnose atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) characteristics up to the highest flight level. The calculated bulk Richardson values indicate a dynamically unstable region behind the escarpment and near the ground for both days. At higher altitudes, the ABL is returning to a near neutral state. The same characteristics are found in the model but only for the first day. The second day, where shear instabilities are more dominant, is not well simulated. UAS proves its great value for sensing the flow over complex terrains at high altitudes and we demonstrate the usefulness of UAS for validating and improving models.",Transport aircraft,2020
Comparative Assessment of Parallel-Hybrid-Electric Propulsion Systems for Four Different Aircraft,"Until electric energy storage systems are ready to allow fully electric aircraft, the combination of combustion engine and electric motor as a hybrid-electric propulsion system seems to be a promising intermediate solution. Consequently, the design space for future aircraft is expanded considerably, as serial hybrid-electric, parallel hybrid-electric, fully electric, and conventional propulsion systems must all be considered. While the best propulsion system depends on a multitude of requirements and considerations, trends can be observed for certain types of aircraft and certain types of missions. This Paper provides insight into some factors that drive a new design toward either conventional or hybrid propulsion systems. General aviation aircraft, regional transport aircraft vertical takeoff and landing air taxis, and unmanned aerial vehicles are chosen as case studies. Typical missions for each class are considered, and the aircraft are analyzed regarding their takeoff mass and primary energy consumption. For these case studies, a high-level approach is chosen, using an initial sizing methodology. Only parallel-hybrid-electric powertrains are taken into account. Aeropropulsive interaction effects are neglected. Results indicate that hybrid-electric propulsion systems should be considered if the propulsion system is sized by short-duration power constraints. However, if the propulsion system is sized by a continuous power requirement, hybrid-electric systems offer hardly any benefit.",Transport aircraft,2020
Interplay of unsteady aerodynamics and flight dynamics of transport aircraft in icing conditions,"Airframe icing causes significant degradation of aerodynamic characteristics and influences the flight safety. Wind tunnel study of longitudinal steady and unsteady aerodynamic characteristics of a transport aircraft in icing conditions is carried out in order to develop mathematical model of aerodynamics in the extended flight envelope. The wind tunnel results are validated through flight tests conducted for the real aircraft. Large, glaze-horn ice shapes, corresponding to holding flight phase, are considered. Influence of an ice protection system as well as its failure is examined. Effect of icing on the unsteady aerodynamics characteristics is studied not only through wind tunnel tests but also via analysis of subsequent influence on the flight dynamics of the aircraft. The conducted study shows that the ice shapes of the holding phase lead to reduced stall angle of attack (AoA), maximum lift, and longitudinal damping. Flight dynamics analysis demonstrates that dangerous aircraft behaviour in the form of high AoA departure and limit cycle oscillations (LCO) can be observed at smaller elevator deflections for the iced aircraft. The account for icing influence on the unsteady aerodynamics in the flight dynamics simulations revealed degradation of the dynamic response and deterioration of phase portraits of the system. Even for small AoA and elevator deflection, the aircraft might be trapped into the basin of attraction of high-AoA LCO. In addition, incorporating icing effects in unsteady aerodynamics manifest larger amplitude of LCO. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Transport aircraft,2020
Comparison Between Coreless and Yokeless Stator Designs in Fully-Superconducting Propulsion Motors,"Hybrid electric propulsion could be the solution to the ambitious environmental targets of the aerospace industry. Fully-superconducting machines have the potential to deliver the step-change in specific torque, power, and efficiency capabilities required for large civil transport aircraft applications. However, fully-superconducting machines are still in their infancy. This article investigates the electromagnetic design of two different stator design concepts for an ac fully-superconducting machine for an aerospace distributed fan motor application. A benchmark aerospace specification of 1 MW was chosen and the design of a conventional permanent-magnet machine was used to assess the performance of the two equivalent fully-superconducting ac motor designs. Following the guidelines from an experimental study of the losses in a small ac stator prototype with MgB2 coils, a fully-superconducting air-cored stator design and a new yokeless stator design are proposed. Both ac superconducting machine designs use superconducting bulk magnets mounted on a rotor core and an MgB2 superconducting stator winding. This article discusses the key design issues of the two stator layouts in relation to the current aerospace targets for efficiency and power density.",Transport aircraft,2020
Aircraft positioning using DGNSS technique for GPS and GLONASS data,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the problem of implementation of the differential global navigation satellite system (DGNSS) differential technique for aircraft accuracy positioning. The paper particularly focuses on identification and an analysis of the accuracy of aircraft positioning for the DGNSS measuring technique. Design/methodology/approach The investigation uses the DGNSS method of positioning, which is based on using the model of single code differences for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations. In the research experiment, the authors used single-frequency code observations in the global positioning system (GPS)/global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) system from the on-board receiver Topcon HiperPro and the reference station REF1 (reference station for the airport military EPDE in Deblin in south-eastern Poland). The geodetic Topcon HiperPro receiver was installed in Cessna 172 plane in the aviation test. The paper presents the new methodology in the DGNSS solution in air navigation. The aircraft position was estimated using a ""weighted mean"" scheme for differential global positioning system and differential global navigation satellite system solution, respectively. The final resultant position of aircraft was compared with precise real-time kinematic - on the fly solution. Findings In the investigations it was specified that the average accuracy of positioning the aircraft Cessna 172 in the geocentric coordinates XYZ equals approximately: +0.03 divided by +0.33 m along thex-axis, -0.02 divided by +0.14 m along they-axis and approximately +0.02 divided by -0.15 m along thez-axis. Moreover, the root mean square errors determining the measure of the accuracy of positioning of the Cessna 172 for the DGNSS differential technique in the geocentric coordinates XYZ, are below 1.2 m. Research limitations/implications In research, the data from GNSS onboard receiver and also GNSS reference receiver are needed. In addition, the pseudo-range corrections from the base stations were applied in the observation model of the DGNSS solution. Practical implications The presented research method can be used in a ground based augmentation system (GBAS) augmentation system, whereas the GBAS system is still not applied in Polish aviation. Social implications The paper is destined for people who work in the area of aviation and air transport. Originality/value The study presents the DGNSS differential technique as a precise method for recovery of aircraft position in civil aviation and this method can be also used in the positioning of aircraft based on GPS and GLONASS code observations.",Transport aircraft,2020
Aerosol optical properties as observed from an ultralight aircraft over the Strait of Gibraltar,"An unprecedented scientific flight was conducted over the Strait of Gibraltar to study the optical properties of the atmospheric aerosols from the sea surface to the lower free troposphere within the framework of the southern Spain experiment for spaceborne mission validation (SUSIE). A Rayleigh-Mie lidar was installed on an ultralight aircraft (ULA) for vertical (nadir) and horizontal line-of-sight measurements. This experiment took place on 13 August 2011 in parallel with continuous observations with a N-2-Raman lidar from the coastal site of San Pedro Alcantara (similar to 50 km northeast of Gibraltar). Significant differences were observed between the optical properties of the aerosol layers sampled over the Strait of Gibraltar and San Pedro Alcantara. These differences are related to the surface-atmosphere interface in the planetary boundary layer and the origins and transport processes in the lower free troposphere. A significant contribution of terrigenous aerosols originating from the Iberian Peninsula is highlighted over the two areas. These polluted dusts are identified with lidar ratios (LRs) similar to 45 +/- 8 sr higher than those of Saharan aerosols sampled during the same period (< 34 sr) at 355 nm. Furthermore, the particle depolarization ratio is derived with values of similar to 10 %-15 % for the polluted dust and > 20 % for the Saharan dusts. The difference in LRs is the opposite of what is usually assumed for these two types of aerosols and highlights the need to update the classification of aerosols in terms of LR to be used in the inversion of vertical profiles from future spaceborne missions embedding a lidar operating at 355 nm.",Transport aircraft,2020
Low speed longitudinal dynamic stability analysis of a hypersonic waverider using unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes forced oscillation simulations,"Hypersonic waveriders have the potential to significantly reduce travel times on long haul civilian transport routes. The design of hypersonic aircraft is heavily influenced by the aerodynamic efficiency at the cruise Mach number, resulting in less than ideal geometries for subsonic flight. Waverider aerodynamics and stability in the low speed regime is rarely investigated and not well understood, but is crucial for horizontal take-offs and landings. To date, low speed analyses of waverider shapes is confined to static investigations, with no studies on the dynamic behaviour ever completed. This paper presents results from unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes simulations modelling pitching and plunging forced oscillations of the low speed propelled variant of the Mach 8 HEXAFLY-INT waverider. Tests were conducted at a speed of 20 m/s, which correlates to a Reynolds number of approximately 1.5 x 10(6) . Pitching and plunging oscillations were at 1 Hz with an angle of attack amplitude of 1 degree. The vehicle was analysed through an angle of attack range from -5 to 15 degrees in 5 degree increments. Results for the HEXAFLY-INT aircraft at the nominal centre of gravity location, 44.4% of the vehicle length, show that the vehicle is positively damped for all cases tested. Static derivative predictions extracted from the dynamic data showed strong agreement with existing static CFD and wind tunnel results. Further dynamic investigations conducted at a centre of gravity location of 53.1% of the vehicle length, the aft static stability limit, also showed positive damping. For these cases, the derivative magnitudes were lower, which indicates decreased damping compared to the nominal centre of gravity location. The vehicle was generally not sensitive to changes in driving frequency, with oscillation rates ranging from 0.5 to 2 Hz tested. However, during plunging tests, the pitching moment derivative was seen to change by as much as 22%. This is attributed to changes in the leading edge vortices with AoA rate. The results from this study, along with previous work looking at the static aerodynamics, stability and control authority, show the feasibility of moving to the flight test phase, but the aircraft dynamic stability in the lateral-directional planes must first be investigated.

A two-stage optimization approach for aircraft hangar maintenance planning and staff assignment problems under MRO outsourcing mode,"Aircraft Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) is essential to ensure aviation safety and air transport operations. An aircraft has to temporally suspend its service and receive extensive maintenance in the hangar upon reaching the prescribed flying hours and take-off/landing times. Traditionally, each airline company undertakes hangar maintenance for its own fleet, however the nature of MRO operations has changed with the rapid development of air transport demand. Outsourcing hangar maintenance to maintenance service companies has been increasing among airlines, enabling airlines to reduce the cost of MRO while meeting the aircraft's safety requirements. After receiving the maintenance order with specifications, the maintenance service company needs to determine the maintenance schedules, parking stand allocation, aircraft movement path and staff assignment in the integrated planning problem. To integrate the abovementioned factors, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is developed. In the MILP model, geometric factors are considered, which are integrated with the multi-skill manpower assignment afterwards. Consideration of staff with multiple types of maintenance skills, aligning with the practice of sophisticated hangar maintenance, is incorporated in the model. Secondly, given the complexity of the integrated problem, a two-stage optimization approach is developed by decomposing the original model, which is coordinated by the linkage constraints between the geometric and numeric decision-making scattering in the decomposed subproblems. The results and analysis of numerical experimentation are reported, which shows: (i) the adaptability and efficiency of the two-stage optimization approach and (ii) the tractability of the two-stage optimization approach, which manage to produce good quality solutions in solving medium- to large- size instances. The impacts of maintenance demand intensity and manpower supply variation are also analysed to provide managerial insights.",Transport aircraft,2020
Intrinsic Determinants and Harmonic Measure of Flight Safety,"Awareness of the approaching hazards and assessment of the potential risks are indispensable to continually defend the safety of flight. Hazard identification and risk management involve various aviation events and assessment criteria. A unified mechanism of transforming domain, whereby safety factors are summed up in three intrinsic determinants, was proposed so that all kinds of safety information shall be measurable and evaluable in the form of quantification based on harmonic measure and its tensorial transport. The method was applied to the final approach and landing flare of a large commercial aircraft, where real risks were acknowledged as exemplifications. The results demonstrated that the harmonic measure of flight safety is theoretically rigorous and practically feasible to extend automation and enhance safety.",Transport aircraft,2020
Discharge characteristics and increased electron current during azimuthally nonuniform propellant supply in an anode layer Hall thruster,"Discharge current components, such as electron, ion beam, and lost-to-wall currents, are obtained as functions of azimuthal propellant inhomogeneity in a Hall thruster. Discharge characteristics are discussed based on discharge current oscillation and radial-azimuthal discharge photography. A highly oscillative operation regime is found to be accompanied by radially enlarged expansion of discharge under limited electron currents. Further increases in neutral inhomogeneity lead to quiescent discharge combined with enhanced electron currents and an azimuthally separated ionization region. An axial one-dimensional classical view of electron flow is found to explain the observed electron current evolution only until moderate propellant inhomogeneity occurs. Through discharge image analysis, it is shown that plasma inhomogeneity increases linearly with respect to the input neutral particle inhomogeneity. The evolution of the inhomogeneity does not capture a stepwise increase in the electron current during discharge mode changes; however, the monotonic increase featured in each discharge regime shows that the azimuthal gradient of plasma properties can contribute to increased electron current. Lastly, the weakened magnetic barrier to electron flow resulting from axial-azimuthal variation in plasma structures is presented as another possible cause of increased electron current in nonuniform propellant operations.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Extremely small-diameter, high-density, radio frequency, plasma sources and central gas feeding for next-generation electrodeless plasma thrusters","Radio frequency (RF) waves including helicon waves can readily produce high-electron-density (n(e) up to 10(13) cm(-3)) plasmas with a broad range of external operating parameters. Various featured RF and helicon sources in a wide range of scales are suitable for plasma propulsion schemes. Electrodeless RF plasmas have no direct contact between electrodes and antennas, which enables long-life operation. However, one of the crucial problems is to reduce the plasma size for future applications in nano- and pico-satellites. Diagnostics of the plasma parameters in a small area should also be improved. Furthermore, to increase plasma performance, it is important to consider the radial electron density (n(e)) profile with an increasing upper limit, observed in high-density helicon sources due to the depletion of neutrals. This problem may be controlled by the location of neutral gas feeding and knowledge of the gas pressure distribution. Here, production of RF plasmas, with extremely small diameters from 3-mm down to 0.5-mm including 1-mm, was demonstrated, and characterization of n(e) and the electron temperature was performed with a collisional radiative model. Finally, to improve plasma performance such as n(e) and the thrust force, internal gas feeding was demonstrated using a developed Pirani gauge to measure neutral density.",Transport aircraft,2020
Spatial measurement of axial and radial momentum fluxes of a plasma expanding in a magnetic nozzle,"Spatial profiles of axial and radial momentum fluxes of a plasma expanding in a magnetic nozzle is revealed by using a momentum vector measurement instrument located downstream of a radiofrequency plasma source, where the radial and axial forces exerted to the detector plate facing the source side are independently, directly, and simultaneously obtained. It is shown that a conical structure having high electron temperature and plasma density is significantly responsible for the axial momentum flux, which corresponds to the thrust in an electric propulsion device. The radially outward momentum flux is detected at the outer region of the conical structure, where the electron pressure gradient is formed; implying that the ions are radially accelerated by an electric field. The increase in the radially integrated axial momentum flux along the axis is demonstrated, where the gain of the axial momentum flux occurs at the radially peripheral region of the plasma expanding along the magnetic nozzle.",Transport aircraft,2020
Aero-Propulso-Elastic Analysis of a Supersonic Transport,"An aeroelastic modeling capability of a flexible aircraft with gas turbine engines is developed using a computational fluid dynamics tool as an integration platform. The new modeling capability allows for the typical aeroelastic analysis to include a nonlinear dynamic model of the turbomachinery that is capable of capturing relevant gas dynamics. An example case of the aero-propulso-elastic (APE) modeling capability is explored for a supersonic transport vehicle with turbofan engines. An overview of the methodology for integrating the propulsion system and elastic vehicle is provided. This is followed by a study to explore coupling sensitivities compared against typical aeroelastic analysis. Dynamic and static vehicle responses are considered across key flight conditions and vehicle-level angles of attack, where the inclusion of the propulsion system has a 10% increase in vehicle wing tip deformations. It is found that the propulsion system is stable at various operating conditions, with structural oscillations having little impact on propulsion system performance. Perceived loudness, a key performance metric for a supersonic transport, is investigated using the APE model. Results lead to an approximately 4 dB increase in noise over a rigid body analysis that neglects the propulsion system. The greatest impacts are shown during off-nominal conditions.",Transport aircraft,2020
Controllability Gramian as Control Design Objective in Aircraft Structural Design Optimization,"Because of their higher aerodynamic efficiency and lighter structural weight, thin composite wings with large aspect ratios are increasingly being used for civil transport aircraft wing design. However, the increased flexibility can induce several performance issues, such as high deflections, reduced control authority, coupled flight dynamics, and, possibly, a reduction in the flutter speed. Therefore, including control surface and control law design at the conceptual design stage is becoming increasingly important. This paper presents a novel approach for integrating a control objective into an aircraft design optimization at the conceptual design stage by proposing the use of the eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian to enhance the controllability of an aircraft. The individual eigenvalues of the controllability Gramian quantify the energy required to move along the corresponding eigenvector, which is observed to be dominated by one state-space variable. A higher eigenvalue implies lower energy requirements for controlling that eigenvector, thus the corresponding state-space variable. This approach does not rely on a control law design but on modifying the open-loop system such that it is easier to control. The approach is applied to conduct multidisciplinary design analysis and optimization (MDAO) of a composite flying-wing test aircraft. A previously developed MDAO framework is used to design the internal structural layout, using curvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs) and straight spars and ribs. It is found that the optimal control designs have up to 8% higher flutter speed with a 3.7% weight penalty. Moreover, the frequencies of the vibration mode shapes are higher for the optimal control designs. The active flutter suppression controllers are designed after the MDAO process, and it is found that the optimal control designs have significantly higher gain and phase margins. As a result, the optimal control designs yield higher robust closed-loop flutter speed as compared with the weight-minimized design.",Transport aircraft,2020
Affinity laws for impellers trimmed in two partial emission pumps with very low specific speed,"Partial emission pumps or open impeller pumps or tangent pumps with very low specific speed at either fast or conventional speed have found extensive applications in aircraft, liquid rockets, cryogenic fluid systems, chemical and petroleum-chemical industries, energy and food processing systems, etc. Usually, impeller trimming of rotodynamic pumps serves as an effective tool to meet required hydraulic performance of a liquid transport system and also to improve the entire system energy utilization efficiency. However, the affinity laws for the impeller trimming in a partial emission pump have been unavailable so far. In the paper, such affinity laws in terms of constant and variable exponents were established for flow rate, head, efficiency, flow coefficient and head coefficient based on the existing experimental data of two partial emission pumps at best efficiency points. It was shown that the affinity laws differ from the counterparts for centrifugal pumps, especially the exponent of around 2 for flow rate and the exponent of approximately 1.5 for head in comparison with nearly 1.5 for flow rate and about 2 for head in centrifugal pumps. The underlying mechanism for this effect was disclosed in terms of the ratios of the hydraulic, volumetric and mechanical efficiencies after trimming to the efficiencies before trimming analytically. The hydraulic loss, leakage flow rate and recirculation flow rate in two pumps were estimated according to the elements of fluid mechanics. It was identified that the hydraulic loss in the volute is more dominant than in the impeller and responsible for the rise of hydraulic efficiency with the trimming in progress. Moreover, the significant increase of recirculation flow rate between the volute tongue and the impeller outlet contributes to the substantial reduction in flow rate after impeller trimming.",Transport aircraft,2020
Evaluating the effects of lateral control surfaces failure on the generic transport model: a case study,"Extensive research in recent years has focused on improving the current loss-of-control prevention systems and developing new strategies for safe path planning of the impaired aircraft. Success in developing such systems requires a comprehensive perception of the influence of damage on the aircraft's dynamic behaviour and performance, and the effect of various failure degrees on the flight envelope confinement and the remaining safe maneuvers. This paper comprehensively describes the effects of lateral control surface failure on the NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) flight envelope, defined by a set of attainable steady-state maneuvers herein referred to as trim points. The study utilises a large database of high-fidelity maneuvering flight envelopes computed for the unimpaired case and wide ranges of the aileron and rudder failure cases at different flight conditions. Flight envelope boundary is rigorously investigated, and the key parameters confining the trim points at different boundary sections are identified. Trend analyses of the impaired flight envelopes and the corresponding limiting factors demonstrate the effect of various failure degrees on the remaining feasible trim points. Results can be employed in emergency path planning with potential uses in the development of aircraft resilient control and upset recovery systems.",Transport aircraft,2020
Significance of thickness of paraboloid of revolution and buoyancy forces on the dynamics of Erying-Powell fluid subject to equal diffusivity kind of quartic autocatalysis,"The flows of non-Newtonian fluid over upper horizontal surfaces of rockets, over bonnets of cars, and pointed surfaces of aircraft are of great importance to the experts in the field of space sciences, automobile construction, and aerodynamic industry where efficiency is dependent on the thickness of paraboloid of revolution, buoyancy, and autocatalysis. The purpose of this study is to present not only the nonlinear governing equation which models the transport phenomenon, but also to analyze the non-Newtonian Erying-Powell fluid flow within a thin layer formed on an object which is neither a perfect horizontal nor a vertical, and neither an inclined surface nor a cone/wedge. The governing equation suitable to model the transport phenomenon above for the case of equal diffusivity during quartic autocatalytic kind of chemical reaction was non-dimensionalized and solved numerically. The velocity of the flow along x-direction can be enhanced when thickness increases negligible but buoyancy forces increase significantly. The rate of increase in the velocity of the flow along the y-direction from the wall to the free stream is optimal when the thickness of the paraboloid of revolution is zero (objects with a uniform thickness) and buoyancy force is sufficiently large. The concentration of Erying-Powell fluid at the wall G(0) is a decreasing function of Prandtl number but an increasing property of Schmidt number. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

"Rake impact on turboshaft compressors, a numerical study","Purpose Turboshaft engines usually include one centrifugal compressor due to its high-pressure ratio, stability and compactness. Many designers rely on positive raking to decrease tip gap flow and therefore losses. However recent optimization studies revealed geometries contradicting this canonic view. Hence, this paper aims to investigate how the rake angle alone can influence performance and to which extent. Design/methodology/approach A turboshaft representative impeller was chosen and altered for null and +/-30 degrees rake angles. Menter's shear stress transport model is used for steady computational fluid dynamics simulations, sweeping the nominal speedline at various tip clearances. Backsweep distribution is identical in all cases, isolating rake influence. Findings Pressure ratio was lowered for the both positively and negatively raked blades, but through distinct aerodynamic mechanisms. Although the flow through the tip gap was lower for the positive rake, this is due to lower blade loading. Splitter comparison reveal that these effects are more pronounced in the radial regions. Practical implications Some of the findings may extend beyond turboshaft engines, into turbochargers, home appliances or industrial blowers. However, all extrapolations must consider specific differences between these applications. Turboshaft compressors designers can benefit from this study when setting up their free parameters and penalty functions in the early concept stages. Originality/value Only few similar studies can be found in the literature to date, none similar to turboshaft applications. Also, this impeller is designed to eliminate leading edge shocks and suction side boundary layer separation, which makes it easier to isolate the tip gap flow effects. The authors also provide a framework on which semi-empirical design equations can be further developed to incorporate rake into 1D design tools.",Transport aircraft,2020
Large aircraft reliability study as important aspect of the aircraft systems' design changes and improvements,"Along with the increase in air traffic, the number of reported aviation events also increases. The authors have performed processing of the data included in the European Coordination Centre for Aviation Incident Reporting Systems (ECCAIRS) analyzing large aircraft reliability and safety of their operations considering events according to ICAO aviation occurrence categories. The airframe systems are the biggest contributor to the total number of reported events which occurred on the Polish registered large aircraft in the years 2008-2018. Failures of these systems caused more than 23% of total reported aviation events. Based on the ECCAIRS data, determination of occurrence categories essential for aviation safety was performed with the assessment of their safety risk level. Also, detailed airframe systems' reliability study was carried out in order to assess the real reason of their failures. Airframe systems' faults were assigned to the specific ATA chapters and then to each of their sections. The most frequently occurring defects of each unit of the particular airframe system were identified. The results of this analysis may support the decisions of supervisory authorities in the areas where security threats are most important. They can also help aircraft operators with identification of the airframe units which require special attention, and as support in improvement of safety analysis. Identification of significant parts due to the frequency of malfunctions of the system components can be a support for designers who have the information needed to improve the design of specific airframe system.",Transport aircraft,2021
Mathematical optimization in enhancing the sustainability of aircraft trajectory: A review,"Rapid advances in technologies that improve the management of aircraft have provided a new opportunity for practitioners to address key social, environmental and economic impacts resulting from aircraft operations. A problem which has been extensively analyzed in the literature is the aircraft trajectory optimization problem. This is due to its relevance and direct impact on social, environmental and economic factors associated with flight operations. A need therefore exists to review the state-of-the-art literature on sustainable aircraft trajectory planning. This paper proposes a novel classification framework for categorizing research conducted on the sustainable fixed-wing aircraft trajectory mathematical optimization problem. Specifically, the proposed framework addresses the following integral research questions: (1) how is aircraft trajectory optimization modeled in the literature to ensure sustainable operations? (2) Which objective functions are optimized? (3) Which methods are used to solve sustainable trajectory optimization problems?",Transport aircraft,2020
Performance Analysis of a H-Darrieus Wind Turbine for a Series of 4-Digit NACA Airfoils,"The purpose of this paper is to estimate the H-Darrieus wind turbine aerodynamic performance, aerodynamic blade loads, and velocity profiles downstream behind the rotor. The wind turbine model is based on the rotor designed by McDonnell Aircraft Company. The model proposed here consists of three fixed straight blades; in the future, this model is planned to be developed with controlled blades. The study was conducted using the unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) approach with thek-omega shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The numerical two-dimensional model was verified using two other independent aerodynamic approaches: a vortex model and the extended version of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLOWer. All utilized numerical codes gave similar result of the instantaneous aerodynamic blade loads. In addition, steady-state calculations for the applied airfoils were also made using the same numerical model as for the vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) to obtain lift and drag coefficients. The obtained values of lift and drag force coefficients, for a Reynolds number of 2.9 million, agree with the predictions of the experiment and XFOIL over a wide range of angle of attack. A maximum rotor power coefficient of 0.5 is obtained, which makes this impeller attractive from the point of view of further research. Research has shown that, if this rotor were to work with fixed blades, it is recommended to use the NACA 1418 airfoil instead of the original NACA 0018.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Kinetic, 3-D, PIC-DSMC Simulations of Ion Thruster Plumes and the Backflow Region","Three-dimensional, fully kinetic, coupled particle-in-cell direct simulation Monte Carlo (PIC-DSMC) simulations are performed to accurately predict the self-consistent electric field and plume and backflow characteristics of an ion thruster, and are compared with results based on the usual Boltzmann approximation. The fully kinetic calculations are performed for the first time using the operational thruster exit number densities without geometric scaling and the actual electron-to-ion mass ratio. It was found that kinetic treatment of both electrons and ions significantly affects the self-consistent radial electric field as well as the backflow ion characteristics. For the xenon ion plume with a colocated electron source, increase in the thruster exit number density strengthens the radial electric field which, in turn, increases the energy of the backflow ions by an order of magnitude. In addition, the spanwise variation of the ion flux on the solar panel showed that charge-exchange ions mostly impinge at the tip of the solar panel, furthest from the thruster geometry, for the fully kinetic cases. In comparison, the Boltzmann relation predicts a lower radial electric field for the operational high number density case, resulting in near-normal ion incidence angles in the backflow region causing significant flux closer to the thruster geometry.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Lightning Currents on Fastening Assemblies of an Aircraft Fuel Tank, Part I: Uncertainties Assessment With Statistical Approach","This paper proposes a statistical approach in order to assess the fastening resistances uncertainties in aircraft assemblies. This method relies on the use of the maximum likelihood estimation method, several statistical tests, and/or statistical criteria. Using the Dassault-Aviation measurement database, distribution laws are established in order to characterize uncertainties in the lightning impact on the fasteners. A simple finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) fastener model is proposed with a wire and a resistance. This generic model can represent any fasteners. The statistical model established from the fastener resistances state after a lightning shot is used to define the stochastic distribution values in the fastener electric model. This model is added to a 3-D FDTD parallelepiped generic fuel tank model. In this paper, we compare the current distributions between a composite and metallic fuel tank. The results highlight not only the model uncertainties effects on the statistical approach but also the fuel tank material choice impact.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Lightning Currents on Fastening Assemblies of an Aircraft Fuel Tank, Part II: FDTD Modeling Merged With a Circuit Model Supplemented by a Statistical Model","This paper presents a fastening assemblies FDTD model based on a lumped element circuit integrated into thin wire formalism. It can be used to quantify current dispersion or extreme current in aircraft fuel tank fasteners and to optimize the lightning protection in hotspot zones. An original method allows the characterization of the fastener lumped resistances. This method dealing with dc measurement and an optimization process is validated provided that 1) the measurements number is greater than the lumped elements number and 2) each node of the circuit is used at least once. Due to the large uncertainties from one fastener to the other one in the same family, the circuit model is supplement with a statistical model using the results about the fastener resistances state after a lightning shot presented in part I. Stochastic distribution values are applied to each lumped resistance of the fastener circuit model. Making a hybridization between a circuit solver and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, the circuit model is added in the same three-dimensional FDTD generic fuel tank modeling as presented in part I. Comparing the current distributions of the simple model of the part I and the circuit model, the uncertainties introduced by each model are presented.",Transport aircraft,2020
Identification of efficient geometries for variable pitot inlets for supersonic transport,"PurposeThis paper aims to reveal the influence of selected geometric parameters on the aerodynamic performance of circular variable aero engine inlets in transonic and supersonic civil aviation.Design/methodology/approachThe trade-off in inlet design and aerodynamic evaluation parameters is presented. The approach to investigate the dependencies between the aerodynamic and geometric parameters at different flight conditions by means of a parametric design study is introduced.FindingsThe dependencies of inlet drag and efficiency from geometric parameters at flight speeds of Mach 0.95 up to Mach 1.6 are identified. Although entailing additional weight, the inlet length represents the parameter with the highest potential for drag reduction by up to 50% in the selected design space. Ideal geometries for variable pitot inlets are determined. After considering weight, their potential range benefit nearly disappears for subsonic applications, but remains above 20% for supersonic flight at Mach 1.6.Originality/valueHence, the technology of circular variable pitot inlets for supersonic transport aircraft could be a way to achieve the ambitious ecological, safety and economic goals for future civil aviation.",Transport aircraft,2020
Cross Validation of Aerodynamic Shape Optimization Methodologies for Aircraft Wing-Body Optimization,"This paper presents the cross validation of two aerodynamic shape optimization methodologies in order to validate, characterize, and compare the two methodologies. Both methodologies use gradient-based optimization based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations driven by the discrete adjoint method. The first methodology uses a B-spline surface representation of the geometry coupled with free-form deformation and axial curve-based geometric control, as well an efficient linear elasticity-based mesh deformation method. The second methodology uses class-shape transforms for airfoil geometry control and either in-CAD or out-of-CAD surface modeling. Two benchmark geometries are used for comparison: a wing-body configuration representative of a large transport aircraft, and a wing-body configuration with aft-mounted nacelles typical of a small business jet. Both single-point and multipoint optimizations are performed. Cross validation is conducted such that flow evaluations are performed on the geometries produced by the two methodologies using a single flow solver and consistent meshes. It is found that both methodologies provide similar geometries and performance improvements. The primary differences that exist are a result of the distinct geometry parameterization and control methods that, in some cases, allow for more localized geometric control. The degree of agreement is indicative of the maturity that has been achieved by modern state-of-the-art aerodynamic shape optimization methodologies.",Transport aircraft,2020
Loss characteristics of HTS coated conductors in field windings of electric aircraft propulsion motors,"High-temperature superconducting (HTS) coated conductors (CCs) are widely regarded as a promising candidate to enable very high power density motors. These machines operate at high rotational speeds, with some designs going up to 12 000 rpm. HTS CCs are applied to the field windings of these motors to increase the magnetic loading and hence the power density. Even though the superconducting field windings operate with a DC current, due to the magnetic field environment, losses are present. This paper examines the dynamic and total loss characteristics of YBCO-coated conductors in the frequency range relevant to high-speed motors for electric aircraft propulsion. A multi-layer model was created using the H-formulation and the losses for each layer were highlighted. For the first time, it was shown that the DC transport current region in the HTS layer shrinks as the frequency of the applied field increases due to the increased magnetisation current around the edges of the CC, which reduces the dynamic loss per cycle as the frequency increases. To fully understand the loss distribution in the HTS CC, the total loss in the conductor was investigated. For an applied magnetic field of 100 mT and 800 Hz, more than 30% of the total loss occurs in the copper layer due to the decreased penetration depth of the magnetic field and the skin effect. Results show that to accurately model and understand the losses in superconducting field windings, a multi-layer model should be used, since a significant proportion of loss shifts towards the copper stabilizers. Over all, it was shown that both the dynamic loss as well as magnetisation loss play a crucial role in the estimation of the loss in superconducting field windings.",Transport aircraft,2020
Additive metal solutions to aircraft skin corrosion,"This paper focuses on the problem of skin corrosion on the upper wing surfaces of rib-stiffened aircraft. For maritime and military transport aircraft this often results in multiple co-located repairs. The common approach to corrosion damage in operational aircraft is to blend out the corrosion and rivet a mechanical doubler over the region. In particular this paper describes the results of a combined numerical and experimental investigation into the ability of the additive metal technology, Supersonic Particle Deposition (SPD), to restore the load-carrying capacity of rib-stiffened wing planks with simulated skin corrosion. The experimental results reveal that unrepaired skin corrosion can result in failure by yielding. The experimental results also reveal that SPD repairs to skin corrosion can restore the stress field in the structure, and can ensure that the load-carrying capability of the repaired structure is above proof load.",Transport aircraft,2020
Cycle sequence sensitivity of near threshold fatigue under programmed loading - A fractographic study,"Statistically representative programmed block renditions of a transport aircraft wing load spectrum were used to study cycle sequence effects on near-threshold fatigue crack growth rate. Less frequent higher load cycles served as markers that permitted unambiguous estimation of crack growth rate under individual load levels in the load spectrum. Small cycle crack growth rates down to threshold levels are extremely sensitive to the peak-valley sequence of preceding large load cycle, suggesting the need to model the effect of near-tip residual stress on threshold stress intensity in handling load spectra with a large statistical content of smaller load cycles.",Transport aircraft,2020
Assessment on aerodynamic degradation for wing-damaged transport aircraft,"PurposeWingtip loss is an existing type of transport aircraft hazard which is a real threat to flight safety caused by a missile strike, underwing engine explosion or impact with obstructions when performing near-ground operations. The primary effect of the wingtip loss is an asymmetric rolling moment, which may result in the fatal loss of control for the aircraft. This study aims to assess whether aerodynamic degradation will cause a wing-damaged transport aircraft to lose its balance under a certain level of wing damage and if a pilot can compensate for the loss of aerodynamic force and regain the balance of the aircraft.Design/methodology/approachIn this paper, experimental and numerical studies were conducted to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of a wingtip-lost transport aircraft in landing configuration. Various levels of wing damages including wingtip, slat and flap loss were considered. The numerical simulations were performed with ANSYS Fluent. The computational fluid dynamics calculation was validated by wind tunnel tests.FindingsThe aerodynamic performance of the aircraft with wing-damaged condition was presented. It was revealed that the wingtip loss leads to an asymmetric rolling moment and a reduction of the lift force, which affects the balance of the transport aircraft. The methods to compensate for the lift force and the asymmetric rolling moment were investigated for a safe landing. The lateral balance cannot be maintained in cases with serious damage on the wing (larger than 53% of the semi-span) or moderate damage on the wing with loss of slats and flaps.Originality/valueThe nonlinear results indicate the importance of aerodynamic assessment for the sake of training pilots to properly handle the hazard situation and explore the critical facts leading to the air crash.",Transport aircraft,2020
Electric potential barriers in the magnetic nozzle,"Magnetic nozzles are convergent-divergent applied magnetic fields which are commonly used in electric propulsion, manufacturing, and material processing industries. This paper studies the previously overlooked physics in confining the thermalized ions injected from a near-uniform inlet in the magnetic nozzle. Through fully kinetic planar-3V particle-in-cell (PIC) modeling and simulation, an electric potential barrier is found on the periphery of the nozzle throat, which serves to confine the thermalized ions by the electric force. With the initial thermal energy as driving force and insufficient magnetic confinement, the ions overshoot the most divergent magnetic line, which results in the accumulation of positive space charges around the throat. The accumulated charges would create an ion-confining potential barrier with limited extent. Apart from the finite-electron Larmor radius (FELR) effect, two more factors are put forward to account for the limited extent of the potential barrier: the depletion of ion thermal energy and the short-circuiting effect. The influences of inlet temperature ratio of ions to electrons and magnetic inductive strength B-0 are quantitively investigated using the PIC code. The results indicate that the potential barrier serves as a medium to transfer the gas dynamic thrust to the magnetic nozzle while providing constrain to the ions, like the solid wall in a de Laval nozzle. In high-B-0 regime, the finite-ion Larmor radius (FILR) effect becomes dominant rather than the FELR effect in the plasma confinement of magnetic nozzles.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Propulsive modelling for JT9D-3, JT15D-4C and TF-30 turbofan engines using particle swarm optimization","PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to create high-accuracy thrust modelling for cruise flight using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, using PSO, new thrust models with high accuracy for the cruise flight stages of Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3, JT15D-4C and TF-30 engines were created. For this aim, real Mach number, flight altitude and thrust values taken from the engine manufacturers were used. In the model, thrust is given as a function of altitude and Mach number. The sensitivity of the results given by the PSO thrust model has been examined using several different error types. Finally, the effect of some PSO parameters on the created models is examined.FindingsIt was observed that the model created predicted real thrust values with high precision.Practical implicationsThe PSO thrust model can be used in the trajectory estimates of today's aircraft with the use of accurate scaling factors. In addition, using the developed PSO thrust model together with a correct aerodynamic model provides more effective management of air traffic flow in air traffic management applications. Combining the PSO model with fuel flow-rate models will significantly increase engine efficiency and performance; thus, making a major contribution to reducing engine emissions.Originality/valueThe originality of this study is that it is the first thrust modelling made with PSO in the literature for turbofan engines. The use of real data in the study and the creation of models for several different turbofan engines are important for the reliability of thrust models.",Transport aircraft,2020
Optimization of the three-segment aerofoil arrangement based on wind tunnel tests and numerical analysis,"This paper presents the optimization of multi-element aerofoil for the LAR-3 Puffin -- STOL light transport aircraft concept proposal. Based on the geometry and aerodynamic characteristics of the well-known and proven in flight three-segment NACA 63A416 aerofoil, the authors explore the possibility of enhancing its high-lift performance by the movement of slot and flap position in extended (deployed) aerodynamic configuration. In order to determine the optimum positions of aerofoil segments (elements), a multi-step optimization approach was developed. It combines computational fluid dynamics simulations that were used for design space screening and preliminary optimization together with low-turbulence wind tunnel tests which yielded certain results. To decrease the numerical cost of the computer simulation campaign, Design of experiment methods (optimal space-filling design among others) were employed instead of exhausting full factorial (parametric) design. Response surface models of major aerodynamic coefficients (lift, drag, pitching moment) at predicted maximum lift coefficient (C-L max) point allowed to narrow down search space and identify several candidates for optimal configuration to be checked experimentally. Wind tunnel tests campaign confirmed the major trends observed in computational fluid dynamics derived response surface contour plots. For the optimum aerodynamic configuration, chosen experimental C-L max is over 3.9, which is a 10% increase over the baseline (initial slat and flap positions) case. In parallel, the maximum lift-to-drag ratio gain at that point was almost 19%. The research outlined in this paper was conducted on behalf of the aircraft production company and its results will be applied in a newly designed transport aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2021
Nonlinear robust adaptive control of an airplane with structural damage,"This article investigates the design of a novel nonlinear robust adaptive control architecture to stabilize and control an airplane in the presence of left-wing damage. Damage effect is modeled by considering the sudden mass and inertia changes, center of gravity, and aerodynamic variations. The novel nonlinear control algorithm applies a state predictor as well as the error between the real damaged dynamics and a virtual model based on the nominal aircraft dynamics in the control loop of the adaptive strategy. The projection operator is used for the purpose of robustness of the adaptive control algorithm. The stability of the proposed nonlinear robust adaptive controller is demonstrated applying the Lyapunov stability theory. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with two previous successful algorithms, which are implemented on the Generic Transport Model airplane to accommodate wing damage. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed robust adaptive algorithm regarding two other algorithms of adaptive sliding mode and L adaptive control.",Transport aircraft,2020
Improving safety in organ recovery transportation: Report from the ASTS/UNOS/AST/AOPO transportation safety summit,"Despite the passage of a decade since the tragic loss of an organ recovery team from the University of Michigan, there are currently no national standards governing air and ground transportation of organ recovery personnel. Consequently, the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, and the United Network for Organ Sharing jointly convened a transportation summit to review and update recommendations for national transportation standards. Expanded air transport quality assurance protocols, including a requirement for two engine turbine-powered aircraft piloted by two qualified pilots certified through onsite inspections was recommended. Ground transportation providers must ensure adequate safety restraints are available, ambulance avoided if possible, and the use of lights and sirens minimized. Finally, adequate insurance coverage for all team members, including trainees should be provided and should not rely on carrier liability insurance policies. The summit participants have committed the support of their organizations to promote and enact these regulations nationally.",Transport aircraft,2020
A methodology for multirotor aircraft power budget analysis,"PurposeThe primary purpose of this study is to analyse the performance of multirotor unmanned aircraft system platforms for passenger transport and compare them with an ordinary helicopter solution. This study aims to define a standard procedure for power budget analysis of unconventional vehicles recently proposed in the aerospace industry, providing guidelines on rotor sizing in terms of required power and the total number of rotors. The ultimate purpose of the proposed work is to describe a methodology for power estimation with regard to emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (EVTOL) vehicles.Design/methodology/approachIn the context of urban mobility, short-range passenger transport between critical hubs in cities is taken into account and innovative aircraft and traditional helicopters are compared according to a common mission profile. The power budget equations used in the helicopter literature are revisited to consider different multirotor configurations (up to 20 rotors) and evaluate the feasibility of innovative aerospace vehicle design.FindingsThe paper includes insights into the maximum number of rotors that ensure a significative, relative power reduction compared to helicopter platforms (the power-to-cruise over power-to-hover ratio appears to be improved). Based on this preliminary analysis, the results suggest the benefit of reducing the installed rotors to avoid excessive power loss in forward flight.Practical implicationsThe proposed study provides guidelines for further design considerations and the future development of EVTOL multirotor aircraft.Originality/valueThis paper fulfils the identified need for a systematic approach on performance analysis for innovative vehicles involved in commercial applications.",Transport aircraft,2020
Conceptual design and analysis of an affordable truss-braced wing regional jet aircraft,"A regional, turbofan-powered, 72-passenger, transport aircraft with very high aspect ratio truss-braced wings is developed with an affordable methodology from an existing 52 passenger, conventional twin-turboprop aircraft. At first, the ration behind the selection of the truss-braced wing configuration is discussed. Next, the methodologies for the sizing, weight, aerodynamics, performance, and cost analysis are presented and validated against existing regional aircraft. The variant configurations and their design features are then discussed. Finally, sensitivity analysis is carried out to investigate the effects of the wing aspect ratio and engine bypass ratio on the aircraft weight, aerodynamics, and cost. It has been found that the penalties associated with the wing weight will prevent the acceptable realization of the high aspect ratio wing benefits, but when it is combined with the very high bypass ratio engines, a 17% reduction in the mission fuel weight is achieved. In contrast, the cost analysis has revealed that the application of higher aspect ratio wings in the truss-braced wing configuration may increase the development and maintenance costs. Consequently, with aspect ratios higher than 24, eventually, these costs may outperform the associated fuel cost reductions.",Transport aircraft,2020
The far-field plasma characterization in a 600W Hall thruster plume by laser-induced fluorescence,"Non-intrusive characterization of the singly ionized xenon velocity in Hall thruster plume using laser induced fluorescence (LIF) is critical for constructing a complete picture of plume plasma, deeply understanding the ion dynamics in the plume, and providing validation data for numerical simulation. This work presents LIF measurements of singly ionized xenon axial velocity on a grid ranging from 100 to 300 mm in axial direction and from 0 to 50 mm in radial direction for a 600W Hall thruster operating at the nominal condition of discharge voltage 300 V and discharge current 2 A, the influence of discharge voltage is investigated as well. The ion velocity distribution function (IVDF) results in the far-field plume demonstrate a profile of bimodal IVDFs, especially prominent at radial distances greater than channel inner radius of 22 mm at axial position of 100 mm, which is quite different from that of the near-field plume where bimodal IVDFs occur in the central core region for the same power Hall thruster when compared to previous LIF measurements of BHT-600 by Hargus (2010 WJ. Propulsion Power 26 135). Beyond 100 mm, only single-peak IVDFs are measured. The two-dimensional ion velocity vector field indicates the bimodal axial IVDF is merely a geometry effect for the annular discharge channel in the far-field plume. Results about the IVDF, the most probable velocity and the accelerating potential profile along the centerline all indicate that ions are still accelerating at axial distances greater than 100 mm, and the maximum most probable velocity measured at 300 mm downstream of the exit plane is about 19 km s(-1). In addition, the most probable velocity of ions along radial direction changes a little except the lower velocity ion populations in the bimodal IVDF cases. The ion temperature at axial distances of 10 and 300 mm oscillates along the radial direction, while the ion temperature first increases, and then decreases for the 200 mm case. Finally, the axial position for the ion peak axial velocity on the thruster centerline is shifted upstream for higher discharge voltages, and the velocity curve is becoming steeper with the discharge voltage before reaching the maximum. This observation can be used as a criterion to optimize the thruster performance.",Transport aircraft,2020
Assessment of the BWB aircraft for military transport,"PurposeThe growth in air mobility, rising fuel prices and ambitious targets in emission reduction are some of the driving factors behind research towards more efficient aircraft. The purpose of this paper is to assess the application of a blended wing body (BWB) aircraft configuration with turbo-electric distributed propulsion in the military sector and to highlight the potential benefits that could be achieved for long-range and heavy payload applications.Design/methodology/approachMission performance has been simulated using a point-mass approach and an engine performance code (TURBOMATCH) for the propulsion system. Payload-range charts were created to compare the performance of a BWB aircraft with various different fuels against the existing Boeing 777-200LR as a baseline.FindingsWhen using kerosene, an increase in payload of 42 per cent was achieved but the use of liquefied natural gas enabled a 50 per cent payload increase over a design range of 7,500 NM. When liquid hydrogen (LH2) is used, the range may be limited to about 3,000 NM by the volume available for this low-density fuel, but the payload at this range could be increased by 137 per cent to 127,000 kg.Originality/valueThe results presented to estimate the extent to which the efficiency of military operations could be improved by making fewer trips to transport high-density and irregular cargo items and indicate how well the proposed alternatives would compare with present military aircraft. There are no existing NATO aircraft with such extended payload and range capacities.

Study on the Optimization Method of Point Merge Procedure Based on Benefit in the Terminal Area,"With the rapid development of the air transport industry, the problem of airspace congestion and flight delay in the terminal area (TMA) becomes more and more serious. In order to improve the efficiency of flight operations in TMA, point merge procedure had been devised. This paper takes the approach routes in TMA as the research object, taking into account such conditions as obstacle clearance, flight interval, and procedure area. Based on the flight time, fuel consumption, pollutant emission, and noise impact, an optimization model of point merge procedure is constructed. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize the structure of procedure. The Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport is selected for simulation verification, and the actual flow distribution of the airport is analyzed as an example. The results show that the average flight time was reduced by 0.26 min, the average fuel consumption was reduced by 1,240.64 kg, the average NOx emissions were reduced by 1.09 kg, and the noise impact range was contracted by 55 km(2) after optimization. The point merge procedure optimization method can be expected to reduce the flight time, fuel consumption, and environmental impact of flights in TMA, so as to optimize the aircraft approach trajectory.",Transport aircraft,2020
Evaluating the impact of new aircraft separation minima on available airspace capacity and arrival time delay,"Although the application of new, reduced aircraft separation minima can directly increase runway throughput, the impact thereof on the traffic flow of aircraft arriving at the destination airport has not been discussed yet. This paper proposes a data-driven and queue-based modeling approach and presents an analysis of the impact on the delay time of arriving aircraft in the airspace within a radius of 100 nautical miles around an airport. The parameters of our queuing model were estimated by analysing the data contained in the radar tracks and flight plans for flights that arrived at Tokyo International Airport during the 2 years of 2016 and 2017. The results clarified the best arrival strategy according to the distance from the arrival airport: The combination of airspace capacity control and reduction of the flight time and separation variance is the most powerful solution to mitigate delays experienced by arriving traffic while also allowing an increase in the amount of arrival traffic. The application of new wake vortex categories would enable us to increase the arrival traffic to 120%. In addition, the arrival delay time could be minimised by implementing the proposed arrival traffic strategies together with automation support for air traffic controllers.",Transport aircraft,2020
Scalable Cooperative Transport of Cable-Suspended Loads With UAVs Using Distributed Trajectory Optimization,"Most approaches to multi-robot control either rely on local decentralized control policies that scale well in the number of agents, or on centralized methods that can handle constraints and produce rich system-level behavior, but are typically computationally expensive and scale poorly in the number of agents, relegating them to offline planning. This work presents a scalable approach that uses distributed trajectory optimization to parallelize computation over a group of computationally-limited agents while handling general nonlinear dynamics and non-convex constraints. The approach, including near-real-time onboard trajectory generation, is demonstrated in hardware on a cable-suspended load problem with a team of quadrotors automatically reconfiguring to transport a heavy load through a doorway.",Transport aircraft,2020
Numerical Model of a Helicon Plasma Thruster,"This article is devoted to the presentation of a numerical model of a Helicon Plasma Thruster (HPT) which relies on: 1) the 3-D adVanced fluId dRifT diffUsion plaSma solver (3D-VIRTUS) for the simulation of the plasma source and 2) an analytical model of the plume for the solution of the plasma acceleration and detachment, and in turn for the preliminary estimation of the propulsive performances (e.g., thrust and specific impulse). The results of the numerical model have been compared against experimental measurements performed with a thrust stand in order to evaluate the reliability of the code when dealing with real-life prototypes. Specifically, a dedicated combined numerical-experimental campaign has been conducted on a low power (50-W range) HPT prototype operated with argon propellant.",Transport aircraft,2020
Background pressure effects on ion dynamics in a low-power magnetic nozzle thruster,"The effect of background neutral density on the ion acceleration region of a magnetic nozzle thruster is investigated through a combination of theoretical models and experiment. Ion velocities are measured in the magnetic nozzle using laser induced fluorescence as the background pressure is raised from 0.98 to 26 mu Torr-Xe. It is found that the ion velocity exiting the acceleration region decreases from roughly 12 800 to 10 200 m s(-1) as background pressure is increased corresponding to a drop in accelerated ion energy of 37%. Global models are employed to determine discharge properties and to calculate the power consumed by collisions in the plume. It is found that charge exchange collisions in the plume cannot explain the decrease in performance. As an alternative, inelastic electron-neutral collisions in the plume are proposed as the mechanism responsible for the decrease in ion energy, consuming between 1.6% and 39% of the power incident on the plume as background pressure is increased over the range tested. The findings suggest that facility effects can significantly alter plume dynamics and thruster performance even at relatively low background pressures. However, with the validated global models it is possible to make predictions of on orbit ion velocities using data taken at finite background pressures.",Transport aircraft,2020
A New Method for Control Allocation of Aircraft Flight Control System,"The next generation of aircraft with a large number of effectors will require advanced methods for control allocation (CA) to compute the effectors' commands needed to follow the desired objective while respecting associated constraints. Currently, the main challenge of the CA is to achieve low enough computation time with a deterministically optimal result for a real-time application. In this paper, at first, we cast the CA as a nonlinear convex programming problem which depicts the desired objective function subject to three-axis moment demands and the limits of effectors' movement; then we develop a computationally tractable method for real-time application on the CA of the aircraft flight control system. The method can analytically and deterministically give one optimal solution for the CA and prove this optimal solution to be guaranteed within a certainly maximal computation time. Numerical testing results based on Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and Lockheed-Martin tailless fighter models demonstrate that the method is effective in terms of its computational efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.",Transport aircraft,2020
Model Predictive Control with a Relaxed Cost Function for Constrained Linear Systems,"The Model Predictive Control technique is widely used for optimizing the performance of constrained multi-input multi-output processes. However, due to its mathematical complexity and heavy computation effort, it is mainly suitable in processes with slow dynamics. Based on the Exact Penalization Theorem, this paper presents a discrete-time state-space Model Predictive Control strategy with a relaxed performance index, where the constraints are implicitly defined in the weighting matrices, computed at each sampling time. The performance validation for the Model Predictive Control strategy with the proposed relaxed cost function uses the simulation of a tape transport system and a jet transport aircraft during cruise flight. Without affecting the tracking performance, numerical results show that the execution time is notably decreased compared with two well-known discrete-time state-space Model Predictive Control strategies. This makes the proposed Model Predictive Control mainly suitable for constrained multivariable processes with fast dynamics.",Transport aircraft,2020
APCI Evaluation Method for Cement Concrete Airport Pavements in the Scope of Air Operation Safety and Air Transport Participants Life,"Many factors have an impact on flight operation safety and air transport participants life. This article presents one of them, which is maintenance of the airport infrastructure in a good condition, with proper infrastructure management, in particular of cash and human resources. At the beginning of the article, attention is paid to the aspect of safety and human life in air transport. Also, an overview of world experience in the field of assessment of the technical condition of airport pavements was presented, including the standard method of the Pavement Condition Index (PCI) estimation. Then, the authors propose an innovative method of assessing the condition of airport pavements based on the Airfield Pavement Condition Index (APCI), taking into account, apart from the extent of surface damage, such parameters as load capacity, evenness, roughness, and bond strength. This approach gives a broader picture of the actual condition of the airport pavement, which has a great importance on flight operation safety, including passengers and cruel life. Next the described research method is experimentally verified in real conditions at Polish airports. Finally, an example of using the APCI method in the assessment of selected airport pavements from Polish airports is presented. The results of tests performed on five functional elements of a military airfield are presented. A satisfactory result is obtained for three elements, an adequate-for two.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Facility pressure effects on a Hall thruster with an external cathode, II: theoretical model of the thrust and the significance of azimuthal asymmetries in the cathode plasma","A theoretical model of the thrust produced by a Hall thruster has been developed to provide insight into the longstanding problem of performance dependence on facility pressure. Inputs to the model have been provided by 2D (r-z) axisymmetric simulations that were guided by measurements of the ion velocity field from laser induced fluorescence diagnostics. The combined analyses yield very good agreement with thrust measurements from ground tests of the SPT-140, a Hall thruster operating with an external cathode, and suggest two new findings. First, at intermediate pressures (similar to 9-15 mu Torr) the rise of the thrust with increasing pressure is largely due to fast atoms produced by charge exchange collisions with beam ions. The acceleration region remains spatially invariant and the thrust rise is linear with pressure. As the pressure increases further, displacements of the acceleration region towards the anode become sizeable and reduce the rate of increase in thrust. Second, the thrust increase from vacuum to the lower values of pressure (less than or similar to 9 mu Torr) is driven largely by transport of electrons along magnetic lines, from the cathode to the near-plume of the thruster, which explains why the rise is nonlinear with pressure. It is argued based on first-principles that this higher rate of thrust variation observed at the lowest pressures may be strongly linked to the highly asymmetric distribution of the external-cathode electrons around the discharge. This would explain the insensitivity of performance in thrusters with centrally-mounted cathodes as well as the longstanding challenges 2D axisymmetric simulations have had in uncovering the source of the thrust dependence on facility pressure.",Transport aircraft,2020
Practical Aspects of Frequency-Domain Approaches for Aircraft System Identification,"Practical aspects of frequency-domain approaches for aircraft system identification are explained and demonstrated. Topics related to experiment design, flight data analysis, and dynamic modeling are included. For demonstration purposes, simulated time-series data and simulated flight data from an F-16 nonlinear simulation with realistic noise are used. This enables detailed evaluations of the techniques and results, because the true characteristics of the data and aircraft dynamics are known for the simulated data. Analytical techniques and practical considerations are examined for the finite Fourier transform, nonparametric frequency response estimation, parametric modeling in the frequency domain, experiment design for frequency-domain modeling, data analysis and modeling in the frequency domain, and real-time calculations. Flight data from a subscale jet transport aircraft are used to demonstrate some of the techniques and technical issues.",Transport aircraft,2020
Low speed lateral-directional aerodynamic and static stability analysis of a hypersonic waverider,"Hypersonic waveriders have the potential to significantly reduce travel times on long haul civilian transport routes. The design of hypersonic aircraft is heavily influenced by the aerodynamic efficiency at the cruise Mach number, resulting in less than ideal geometries for subsonic flight. Waverider aerodynamics and stability in the low speed regime is rarely investigated and not well understood, but is crucial for horizontal take-offs and landings. This paper presents a combination of numerical simulation results and experimental data for the low speed propelled variant of the Mach 8 HEXAFLY-INT waverider. Aerodynamic, control and stability testing for lateral-directional cases was conducted in the University of Sydney 4 foot by 3 foot low speed facility, Computational fluid dynamics simulations are compared with wind tunnel tests for angles of attack between -5 and 15 degrees and angles of sideslip between -8 and 8 degrees. Throughout these ranges, aileron and rudder deflections up to 10 degrees are investigated. Results show that the vehicle aerodynamics are dominated by asymmetric wing and fin vortices, resulting in non-linear aerodynamic forces. At a centre of gravity location of 44.4% of the vehicle length the aircraft is stable directionally, but has lateral instability at angles of attack below -2 degrees. This is attributed to the low mounted wings with anhedral. The instability is minor and is not expected to result in an uncontrollable condition. Lowering the centre of gravity by approximately 2 centimetres, or 17% of the local fuselage height, can correct the instability. Lateral-directional dynamic stability was predicted using static derivatives and was found to be stable through the entire AoA range tested, with no dependence on mass moments of inertia. Both aileron and rudder controls are found to provide sufficient control authority, but the aircraft may benefit from increased rudder size. The results from this study, along with previous work on longitudinal stability and performance show the feasibility of moving to the flight test program, but aircraft dynamic stability must first be investigated.

Automatic modeling of aircraft external geometries for preliminary design workflows,"This article introduces a high-fidelity geometry definition methodology enabling Multidisciplinary Design, Analysis and Optimization (MDAO) of aircraft configurations. All definitions and functional features have been implemented within the JPAD software, a Java-based computing library for aircraft designers, which provides a dedicated geometric modeling module called JPADCAD. The geometric module, that comes as an application programming interface (API) built on top of the OpenCASCADE Technology solid modeling kernel, is conceived for the automatic production of parametric aircraft CAD geometries. The tool allows the definition of input geometries for low-fidelity as well as high-fidelity aerodynamic analyses, hence proves to be a key factor in the entire MDAO process, particularly in conceptual or preliminary design analysis workflows. The main goal of such a geometric library remains ease of use and support for automation to minimize unnecessary or repetitive human effort.The backbone of the presented methodology is the parametric definition of a generic commercial transport aircraft configuration that translates into software data structures and functionalities of CAD surface modelers. These aspects are discussed in the first part of the article. The second part presents a use case example of the geometric modeling API, where an automated aerodynamic analysis workflow is used to construct a prediction model for canard-wing configurations.

Simulations of airborne collisions between drones and an aircraft windshield,"Drones are a considerable thread to the safe operation of transport aircraft with the wide application and development trend of drones. The airborne collision safety between the windshield of transport aircraft and the five light unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs) under various possible flight conditions is mainly studied in this paper. The collision simulation model of drone and aircraft windshield is established under PAM-CRASH software environment, which is used to simulate the dynamic response and damage of the windshield after the impact of drone and aircraft windshield under various conditions. The simulation results with that of collision test between whole-level drones and a full-scale aircraft with windshield is compared and analyzed to verify the validity of the simulation. The drone with similar bird mass is also selected to verify the appropriateness of the airworthiness rules of the windshield structure against bird impact to light UAV. The influencing parameters are important to the research results and are taken into a little consideration in the study. The research shows that the configuration, material, weight, speed and attitude of drones all have significant effects on the impact damage to the aircraft windshield, and a ""parallel"" attitude of a 1360 g drone which was proven to be a very severe gesture resulted in an unairworthy consequence at an impact velocity of 154.8 mks. The windshield damage from a 1360 g drone strike is much heavier than that from a bird of a little big mass. It is expected that the high fidelity simulation model can be used to simulate all kinds of working conditions, reduce the test times, and save a lot of economic costs and provide credible technical support and basis for the airworthiness authorities to formulate precise and convincing regulatory regulations in future.

Takeoff Simulation of Lift plus Cruise Air Taxi by Using Navier-Stokes Equations,Takeoff trajectory computations are made for a typical lift+cruise small transport aircraft suitable for an urban air taxi. The selected wing-body model consists of lifting and pushing propellers. Flow is modeled using the Navier-Stokes equations. A procedure is developed to embed the trajectory motion equations in an overset grid topology along with rotating blades. Results are validated with lifting line theory computations. A typical takeoff scenario is demonstrated by time-accurately integrating trajectory equations with the flow equations. The present work extends the capabilities of the current Navier-Stokes solvers to simulate trajectory motions of urban air taxi configurations.,Transport aircraft,2020
System Noise Prediction Uncertainty Quantification for a Hybrid Wing-Body Transport Concept,"Aircraft system noise prediction for advanced, unconventional concepts has undergone significant improvement over the past two decades. Prediction model uncertainty quantification is necessary to reliably assess the potential benefits of unconventional configurations, which can be outside the range of empirical models. This paper builds on previous work to improve estimates of element prediction uncertainties where the model has improved, or new validation data are available. These element-level uncertainties are propagated via a Monte Carlo method to the system level for predictions at each of the three certification points. Although the quantitative uncertainty values contained here are specific to the hybrid wing-body configuration presented, the underlying process is the same regardless of configuration. Comparisons with previous work show a reduction of 1.1 EPNdB in the 95% coverage interval of the cumulative noise level. The largest impediment for continued uncertainty reduction is the need for validation experiments and improved modeling of fan source noise, propulsion airframe aeroacoustic effects, and the Krueger flap source noise, which comprise the bulk of the uncertainty in the cumulative certification noise level.",Transport aircraft,2020
Analysis of the reliability of a starter-generator using a dynamic Bayesian network,"The reliability of a starter-generator in transport aircraft was assessed. Using the process of reliability-centered maintenance (RCM), necessary decisions were made not only to satisfy the reliability requirement but also to reduce the maintenance load. Failure data have indicated that the life of a starter-generator is limited by the reliability of a bearing. The degradation of the bearing was represented by a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). Parameters were learned by using the EM algorithm given failure data. The DBN model yielded more conservative risk projection than traditional survival analysis due to the limited number of failure data. The DBN model can make up for the lack of data records by knowledge of experts. Using a calibrated model, the time for inspection was determined to maintain reliability over a prescribed amount of time.",Transport aircraft,2020
Rising Costs: Augustine Revisited,"Rising military equipment costs were famously identified by Norman Augustine with forecasts of a single aircraft air force by 2054. This paper presents and analyses an original data set for UK military aircraft. It provides evidence on cost escalation for various UK aircraft types comprising fighter/strike, bombers, military transports, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters, trainers and civil aircraft. Continued cost escalation is identified for almost all types but with different cost escalation factors. It is concluded that the specific Augustine hypothesis of costs rising by a factor of four every 10 years might be an under-estimate.",Transport aircraft,2020
Modelling of fuel flow-rate of commercial aircraft for the climbing flight using cuckoo search algorithm,"PurposeThe purpose of this study is to create a new fuel flow rate model adopting cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) for the climbing phase of the flight.Design/methodology/approachUsing the real flight data records (FDRs) of B737-800 passenger aircraft, a new fuel flow rate model for the climbing phase of the flight was developed by incorporating CSA. In the model, fuel flow rate is given as a function of altitude and true airspeed. The aim is to create a model that yields results that are closest to the real fuel flow rate values obtained from flight data records. Various error analysis methods were used to test the accuracy of the obtained values. Finally, the effect of change of some CSA parameters on the model was investigated.FindingsIt was observed that the derived model is able to predict real fuel flow rate values with high accuracy. It has been deduced that increasing the number of nest (n) and discovery rate of alien nests (pa) values of CSA parameters to a certain value gradually decreases the model's accuracy.Originality/valueThe originality of this study is the development of a new fuel flow rate model using CSA as a first attempt in the literature. The use of real flight data is important for the originality and reliability of the model.",Transport aircraft,2020
Performance improvement and flow field investigation in hydraulic torque converter based on a new design of segmented blades,"Hydraulic torque converter is of lower efficiency in the powertrain, particularly at low speed ratio, which is crucial for vehicles due to its ability of torque multiplication. Therefore, torque converters should be taken into account with both higher start-up acceleration and transmission efficiency. Inspired by the fact that the multi-airfoils of the aircraft can improve the lift, a new design of segmented turbine blade in torque converter is presented to improve the transmission efficiency and start-up acceleration. To ensure reproducibility and popularization, the camber line and shape of blades are extracted to obtain the expression in the Cartesian coordinate system. A scale-resolving simulation setting, large eddy simulation with kinetic energy transport, and refined hexahedron meshes, which were verified by our studies, are applied to simulate the three-dimensional transient flow numerically. According to the results of computational fluid dynamics analysis, the new design eliminated the ultra-high vorticity of the near-wall boundary layer to reduce the flow loss, which further improves fuel economy. The pressure difference in the segmented turbine blade is significantly higher than that of the original model, causing the improvement of powertrain performance. As a result, the torque ratio and nominal torque increase by 6.7% and 7.7%, respectively, at stalling speed ratio; meanwhile, the maximum efficiency increases by 1.1%. This research, using a new design of segmented blades, has many advantages, such as high starting torque ratio, large adjusting range, and greater fuel economy, and shows great potential to apply in the manufacturing process.",Transport aircraft,2020
Digitalization: An Opportunity for Contributing to Sustainability From Knowledge Creation,"This paper aims at exploring the perspective of sustainability when digital transformation is adopted by one organization, although it was not the first goal targeted. Two different cases are analyzed, covering manufacturing and service industries.

Real-Time Estimation of Bare-Airframe Frequency Responses from Closed-Loop Data and Multisine Inputs,"A method is presented for estimating frequency responses of multiple-input multiple-output bare-airframe dynamics from flight test data containing feedback control and/or mixing of control effectors. Orthogonal phase-optimized multisines are used to simultaneously excite each input with unique harmonic frequencies, at which frequency responses are computed as ratios of output-to-input Fourier transform data. The confounding effects of feedback and mixing are resolved by interpolation of the frequency responses. The analysis can be run in batch for postflight analysis, or in real time as the aircraft is flying. The effectiveness of the method was verified using simulations of the subscale T-2 generic transport airplane with rate feedback. The method was also demonstrated using flight test data from the X-56A MUTT aeroelastic airplane, which was flown with both feedback control and mixing.",Transport aircraft,2020
Startup characteristics of a dual compensation chamber loop heat pipe with an extended bayonet tube,"Dual compensation chamber loop heat pipe (DCCLHP) is an advanced two-phase heat transfer device, which features an orientation-free operation in the terrestrial surroundings and promises great application potential in the aircraft thermal management. In this work, a DCCLHP with an extended bayonet tube was designed and fabricated, aiming to improve its startup performance especially at a small heat load. The startup characteristics of the DCCLHP in five different orientations was experimentally investigated and theoretically analyzed. According to the experimental results, some important conclusions have been drawn: 1) The DCCLHP with an extended bayonet tube could achieve successful startup under the heat load ranging from 10 to 100 W in the horizontal orientation, and no startup failure occurred. 2) The DCCLHP could start up successfully even at a small heat load of 10 W from -90 degrees to +90 degrees tilt angle in the terrestrial surroundings. 3) Different startup phenomena such as the unique change of the temperature overshoot were observed in the experiments. 4) Operating instability such as the temperature oscillation occurred during the startup process in the favorable directions.

An innovative approach for integrated airline network and aircraft family optimization,"The determination of optimal aerial transport networks and their associated flight frequencies is crucial for the strategic planning of airlines, as well as for carrying out market research, to establish target markets, and for aircraft and crew rostering. In addition, optimum airplane types for the selected networks are crucial to improve revenue and to provide reduced operating costs. The present study proposes an innovative approach to determine the optimal aerial transport network simultaneously with the determination of the optimum fleet for that network, composed of three types of airplanes (network and vehicle integrated design). The network profit is maximized. The passenger's demands between the airports are determined via a gravitational model. An embedded linear programming solution is responsible for obtaining potential optimal network configurations. The optimum fleet combination is determined from a database of candidate aircraft designs via genetic algorithm. A truly realistic airplane representation is made possible thanks to accurate surrogate models for engine and aerodynamics is adopted. An accurate engine deck encompassing a compression map and an innovative engine weight calculation besides an aerodynamical artificial neural network module enable a high degree of accuracy for the mission analysis. The proposed methodology is applied to obtain the optimum network comprised of twenty main Brazilian airports and corresponding fleet. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Detecting fatigue in car drivers and aircraft pilots by using non-invasive measures: The value of differentiation of sleepiness and mental fatigue,"Introduction: Fatigue is one of the most crucial factors that contribute to a decrease of the operating performance of aircraft pilots and car drivers and, as such, plays a dangerous role in transport safety. To reduce fatigue-related tragedies and to increase the quality of a healthy life, many studies have focused on exploring effective methods and psychophysiological indicators for detecting and monitoring fatigue. However, those fatigue indicators rose many discrepancies among simulator and field studies, due to the vague conceptualism of fatigue, per se, which hinders the development of fatigue monitoring devices. Method: This paper aims to give psychological insight of the existing non-invasive measures for driver and pilot fatigue by differentiating sleepiness and mental fatigue. Such a study helps to improve research results for a wide range of researchers whose interests lie in the development of in-vehicle fatigue detection devices. First, the nature of fatigue for drivers/pilots is elucidated regarding fatigue types and fatigue responses, which reshapes our understanding of the fatigue issue in the transport industry. Secondly, the widely used objective neurophysiological methods, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), and electrocardiography (ECG), physical movement-based methods, vehicle-based methods, fitness-for-duty test as well as subjective methods (self-rating scales) are introduced. On the one hand, considering the difference between mental fatigue and sleepiness effects, the links between the objective and subjective indicators and fatigue are thoroughly investigated and reviewed. On the other hand, to better determine fatigue occurrence, a new combination of measures is recommended, as a single measure is not sufficient to yield a convincing benchmark of fatigue. Finally, since video-based techniques of measuring eye metrics offer a promising and practical method for monitoring operator fatigue, the relationship between fatigue and these eye metrics, that include blink-based, pupil-based, and saccade-based features, are also discussed. To realize a pragmatic fatigue detector for operators in the future, this paper concludes with a discussion on the future directions in terms of methodology of conducting operator fatigue research and fatigue analysis by using eye-related parameters.

Influence of cycling aging and ambient pressure on the thermal safety features of lithium-ion battery,"The fire and explosion risks of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) pose serious threat to the transport and application of LIBs on the aircraft. Therefore, the study of corresponding thermal safety problems in flight condition is of great importance. In this work, a dynamic pressure chamber is used to study the effect of cycling aging and ambient pressure on the thermal safety features of LIBs. The results show that both the thermal runaway onset time and temperature decrease with the increase of cycle number or decrease of external pressure. The interval time between gas release and ignition decreases with the increase of cycle number, while the burning time increases with the decrease of pressure. Moreover, the thermal runaway temperature and heat release rate decrease with the increase of cycle number or decrease of pressure. The dV/dQ and X-ray computed tomography results show that the loss and structural damage of cathode materials, and the side reactions are the main factors for the decrease of battery safety. The easier occurrence of thermal runaway in low pressure is attributed to the larger differential pressure which facilitates the opening of burst disk and the entry of air.",Transport aircraft,2020
A systematic airport runway maintenance and inspection policy based on a delay time modeling approach,"This paper aims to present a systematic inspection policy for runway pavements based on the concepts of delay time modeling (DTM) in order to minimize the cost of maintenance by using the optimal inspection interval. Preventive airport runway maintenance is a factor in preventing aircraft being involved in incidents on the ground and is thus an important function in air transport that needs to be managed. Therefore, airport operators' management processes include a maintenance policy that targets airport asphalt pavements to guarantee trafficability and safety. Thus, in addition to presenting a model to minimize the cost of this policy using the DTM concept, this paper reports on a case study regarding how to apply the model at a Brazilian airport. The results obtained by using the model enabled the inspection costs to be justified as these ensure the cost of the maintenance policy adopted is minimized. This model can be used in other airports by parameterizing it with data on failure and wear and tear of the airport runway considered.",Transport aircraft,2020
Potential for a logistics island to circumvent container port congestion in a constrained environment,"This paper examines a new hybrid intercontinental freight transport alternative (IFTA) that combines a logistics island (i.e. an offshore container port), vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, and ocean vessel transport. The hybrid IFTA offers a 'midway' alternative for intercontinental shippers that is cheaper (and slower) than conventional air freight, but slightly faster and significantly more reliable (albeit, more expensive) than conventional ocean vessel transport calling at busy ports that may be subject to disruptive delays. To compare the proposed hybrid IFTA with the conventional air- and ocean-based IFTAs, this paper employs a utility maximization framework. A mathematical model determines the shipper value of time (VOT) range, normalized by payload, for which the proposed hybrid IFTA would be preferable to the conventional air- and ocean-based IFTAs. Preliminary results suggest that this range of shipper VOT, normalized by payload, is between $0.6/ton-hour and $22.9/ton-hour, indicating a potential market for the proposed hybrid IFTA might exist. Additionally, sensitivity analyses reveal several interesting insights; most notably, the attractiveness of the proposed hybrid IFTA hinges on decreasing the distance VTOL aircraft transport freight between the logistics island and an onshore warehouse or transloading facility.",Transport aircraft,2020
The Magnitude of the Spatial Disorientation Problem in Transport Airplanes,"INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-control (LOC) is the major cause of transport airplane mishaps. There have been many published reports and papers examining these accidents. While these studies did mention spatial disorientation (SD) as a cause or a factor, none of them analyzed it further. The present study uses transport and commuter airplane mishap data for a recent 35-yr period and examines the results of those mishaps involving spatial disorientation.METHOD: We identified LOC and SD accidents from five national aviation accident organizations and two independent groups. Only ""normal"" operations (air carrier, noncommercial transportation, ferry flights, and training) were considered. We reviewed transport and commuter airplane accidents using the published reports and identified 94 involving SD.RESULTS: We found the distribution of SD mishaps differs from LOC mishaps. During initial climb, there were relatively fewer SD mishaps (16%) than LOC mishaps (31%). During enroute climb SD has relatively more mishaps (18%) than LOC (11%). During go-around or missed approach phases, there were relatively more SD mishaps (21%) than LOC mishaps (4%). Perhaps the most significant observation was an increasing number of SD mishaps during the period reviewed.DISCUSSION: There are several possible reasons for the increasing numbers of SD mishaps over the study period from 1981 to 2016. Somatogravic illusion during go-around or missed approach accounts for only some of this increase. There is insufficient data to determine the reason for the remaining increase.",Transport aircraft,2020
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes modelling in transonic S-ducts with passive flow control,"S-duct diffusers are used in aircraft with embedded engines to route ambient air to the fan face. Sizing and stealth considerations drive a need for high curvature ducts, but the curvature causes complex secondary flows that lead to total pressure distortion and swirl velocities at the engine face. These must be controlled for stable engine operation. In this paper, tubercles, a novel bio-inspired passive flow control method, are analysed numerically in a duct with transonic flow. The results are compared to experimental data obtained as part of a campaign at the Royal Military College, Canada to investigate the effects of S-duct geometry and novel passive flow control devices on the performance of transonic S-ducts. The performance of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models in the S-ducts is assessed - Menter's shear stress transport model predicts excessive losses due to the overactivity of its stress limiter. The realisable k-epsilon model gives a significant improvement in the prediction of static pressure distributions, but losses and distortion characteristics are predicted poorly due to the model's inability to resolve the effects of unsteadiness in separated regions. Large tubercle geometries are found to trigger earlier separation in the centre of the duct by concentrating low momentum fluid in valleys, but they also act as boundary layer fences away from the duct centre. Smaller geometries are found to generate vortices that re-energise the boundary layer, delaying flow separation. Methods are recommended for future computational analyses of S-ducts and new designs of tubercles.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Patient, Paramedic and Institutional Factors Associated with Delays in Interfacility Transport of Injured Patients by Air Ambulance","Background: Air ambulance services are commonly used to expedite interfacility transport of injured patients to trauma centers. There is a lack of evidence surrounding risk factors for delays in interfacility transport of these patients. The purpose of this study was to examine patient, paramedic, and institutional-related characteristics for delay and identify specific causes of delays in interfacility transfers by air ambulance. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of injured patients undergoing interfacility transfer to a trauma center who were transported by air ambulance. Quantile regression was used to evaluate the impact of patient, paramedic and institutional characteristics on various time intervals of the interfacility transport process. Results: There are three key findings in our study. First, the use of rotor-wing aircraft and hospital-based helipads had substantially lower transport times. Second, transports from academic centers take longer compared to sending facilities with fewer resources. Third, interfacility transport times are heavily skewed and delays disproportionately affect longer patient transports. Conclusions: Ventilator dependence, paramedic level of care, classification of sending facility and helipad availability are associated with delays to interfacility transport of injured patients. Efforts can be made at both the air ambulance and institutional levels to ensure timely and efficient transports.",Transport aircraft,2020

"Method for evaluating the parameter of a radio emission source located on an unmanned aerial vehicle of an aircraft type, based on the Doppler effect","A modern unmanned aerial vehicle is able not only to conduct unauthorized video filming of a protected area, but also to transport and transport prohibited goods to the territory of prisons and colonies or contraband across state borders, to have on board the simplest systems for the delivery and activation of explosive devices, which turns such an aircraft apparatus into a weapon capable of performing sabotage and terrorist missions. Thus, the development of methods for detecting and determining the main parameters of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle is an urgent task and has a pronounced practical significance. The aim of the work is to develop a method for estimating the parameters of the movement of a radio emission source placed on an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle, based on the model of changing the Doppler frequency addition of the radio emission source. Based on the goal, the tasks of the work are: development of a model for changing the Doppler frequency addition of an radio emission source located on an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle; development of a method for estimating the parameters of the motion of radiation sources, based on the model of changing the Doppler frequency addition. Within the framework of the work budget, the model of the change in the Doppler frequency addition of the radio emission source, placed on an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle, moving along a circular or elliptical trajectory. On the basis of the models of the Doppler frequency addition of the radio emission source, a method-estimated of the parameters of the movement of the radio emission source located on an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle have been developed: time of movement of radio emission source along a circular path; time of movement of radio emission source along an extended section of an elliptical trajectory; time of movement of radio emission source along a circular section of an elliptical trajectory; the angle characterizing the relative position of the elliptical trajectory of the unmanned aerial vehicle and the means of the radio control device. With the help of the proposed method for assessing the main temporal and geometric parameters of the movement of an radio emission source located on an aircraft-type unmanned aerial vehicle, it is possible to draw a conclusion about the tasks of the unmanned aerial vehicle in the process of unauthorized over flights of protected objects and other characteristics of the unmanned aerial vehicle, in the absence of technically complex antenna systems to ensure accurate unmanned aerial vehicle direction finding.",Transport aircraft,2020

Static and fatigue testing using the same full-scale transport aircraft structure,"The entire cycle of strength tests of the aircraft structure requires large expenditures of time and effort attributed to the manufacture of two full-size aircraft structures and two test rigs. The pace of development of mode r<sub>n</sub> aviation technology dictates strict requirements for timing and quality of testing, which allows us to ensure competitiveness in the world aircraft market. Therefore, when conducting a full cycle tests, shortening of the testing period becomes of particular importance. We consider a novel approach to strength testing of a full-scale transport aircraft structure which consists in static and fatigue tests carried out on the same object. The developed approach was tried out when testing the full-scale wing structure of a transport aircraft. The tests were carried out on a set-up that allowed reproducing both cases of static loading and variable loads of flight cycles. At the first stage, the static strength was proved by the results of finite-element calculation of the stress state of the structure at ultimate loads using a model verified by the strain measurements of one of the wing consoles under limit loads, as well as by testing typical and critical airframe elements. Samples of full-scale panels were additionally tested for buckling to confirm the load capacity of the upper wing panels. Fatigue tests were carried out in the time span of two design service life. The obtained results showed the possibility of conducting both static and fatigue tests using one and the same full-scale aircraft structure.",Transport aircraft,2020

ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF AIR TRANSPORT NOISE IN THE CASE OF THE CITY OF SOFIA,"Aviation, as every type of transport, is responsible for a number of negative external effects to the environment. The main goal of this study is to reveal the relation between the noise level in the urban areas near to the Sofia airport and the air traffic. Our main research tasks are: to make a literature review of the problem; to gather data for the noise levels; to gather data for the air traffic; to choose relevant statistical methods and models for the revealing of the relation between the noise level and air traffic; to draw conclusions and to make recommendations about the noise pollution in the vicinity of Sofia Airport. The data are on monthly basis and cover the period from August 2015 to December 2017, i.e. 29 months. In our regression model we use four traffic indicators as independent variables: aircraft movements; passengers; freight and mail. In the established regression model we introduce 'the time' as an additional factor, which provides concrete practical advantages. Our results show that only one independent variable (Aircraft movements) affects the Twenty-four hours average equivalent level of noise due to flights. Aircraft movements are the most important factor and we expect their increasing in the future. This will lead to increased noise levels.",Transport aircraft,2020
An integrated optimization mode for multi-type aircraft flight scheduling and routing problem,"This paper proposes an optimization model for the integrated aircraft flight scheduling and routing problem, which allows a simultaneous determination of the departure time of each flight trip and assignment of a set of aircraft located at different airports to perform all flight trips. The proposed model envisages that each flight trip is covered by its own particular aircraft type or a larger airplane. Further, departure and arrival times of each flight trip are within a flexible time window in its aircraft's route and origin/destination airports, and the number of airplanes firstly distributed in the base airports is fully accounted for in the model. The model not only can effectively minimize weighted operation costs for the number of airplanes and the total idle time for adjacent flight trips covered by an aircraft, but also can maximize the number of transported passengers. This paper further presents a two-stage heuristic approach based on the ant colony optimization algorithm, which efficiently finds the most acceptable solutions. The above algorithm is used to generate a series of aircraft routes, and a polynomial algorithm is designed to obtain their feasible flight trip timetable. Finally, the model is applied to a case study to design the integrated aircraft flight scheduling and routing plan for a real airline in China. A comparative analysis of the conventional and proposed models proved the latter's feasibility.",Transport aircraft,2020
Assessing Airport Landing Efficiency Through Large-Scale Flight Data Analysis,"Trajectories optimisation is a major research topic in air transport and air traffic management, due to its profound impact both on passengers, airlines and the environment in general, and consequently on the perceived value and cost of air transportation. While the challenges associated to the optimisation of the en-route part of a flight are well understood, relative less attention has been devoted to the last part, i.e. the approach and landing. Here we show how open large-scale data sets of aircraft trajectories can be used to characterise the efficiency of flights landing at an airport, measured through the time and distance flown below 10,000 feet. The yielded picture is highly heterogeneous, with the time spent at low altitude varying from an average of 10 minutes for Zurich, up to 16 minutes for London Heathrow. Flights arriving at the same airport also experience highly different times, e.g. from 12 to 20 minutes for London Heathrow, depending on factors like traffic volumes, time of the year and of the day, and on interactions with other traffic patterns and airports. From a more general perspective, this contribution illustrates how the availability of large data sets can be used to improve our understanding of the real behaviour of the system, and especially its deviation from what planned.",Transport aircraft,2020
Extension of Quadcopter Flight Range Based on Quadcopter Transport System and Autonomous Ramp Flight Algorithm,"In this study, a new method was developed to extend the flight distance of unmanned aerial vehicles such as quadcopters that operate on a limited battery capacity. The suggested method consists of a high-altitude flight initiation system, which uses a carrier rocket, and an autonomous ramp flight algorithm. First, a quadcopter, called a mission quadcopter in this research, is loaded onto the carrier rocket by a folding mechanism, and the rocket flies to a designated height. Then, the carrier rocket releases the mission quadcopter at the high altitude and achieves flight deployment after an unfolding process. Subsequently, the airdropped mission quadcopter stabilizes its pose and flights toward the selected target point. During the flight, it adopts an autonomous ramp flying trajectory. Ramp flying is performed from the sky to the ground surface instead of conventional step shape flying to minimize the flight trajectory and energy consumed while flying. Experiments were performed in Nevada, USA during an international rocket-based airdrop competition, ARLISS (A Rocket Launch for International Student Satellite). The mission quadcopter's real-time latitude, longitude, and altitude were measured to confirm the position information regarding the quadcopter's flight trajectory. The mission quadcopter successfully separated from the carrier rocket, deployed for flight at a high altitude, turned to the target point, performed autonomous ramp flying, and landed.",Transport aircraft,2020
AUTONOMOUS HEADING SENSORS NAVIGATION AND FLIGHT SYSTEMS AIRCRAFT,"The necessity of solving the problems of the exact initial exhibition of the parking course for solving the problems of navigation and piloting of aircraft, including in critical operating conditions, has been substantiated. The features of the initial exhibition of the course in conditions of middle latitudes and the complexity of determining the parking course in high latitudes are characterized. Various methods of initial course exhibition are considered. The use of transport unmanned aerial vehicles for various purposes is argued. The creation of navigation and ?ight systems based on course and inertial systems using an onboard digital computer for transport unmanned and manned aerial vehicles is proposed. Since the high accuracy of the initial course exhibition and maintaining the high accuracy of the current course in ?ight are the main requirements for navigation and aerobatic systems, it is necessary to constantly improve the methods of conducting the initial exhibition in relation to the speci?c operating conditions of aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2020
"Low speed longitudinal aerodynamic, static stability and performance analysis of a hypersonic waverider","Hypersonic waveriders have the potential to significantly reduce travel times on long haul civilian transport routes. The design of hypersonic aircraft is heavily influenced by the aerodynamic efficiency at the cruise Mach number, resulting in less than ideal geometries for subsonic flight. Waverider aerodynamics and stability in the low speed regime is rarely investigated and not well understood, but is crucial for horizontal take-offs and landings. This paper presents a combination of numerical simulation results and experimental data for the low speed variant of the Mach 8 HEXAFLY-INT waverider, Aerodynamic, control and stability testing was conducted in the University of Sydney 4 foot by 3 foot low speed facility, while propulsion testing of the vehicle-integrated electric ducted fan was completed in the 7 foot by 5 foot tunnel. Motor thrust settings were tested for 8 lithium polymer cells connected serially drawing between 5 and 25 amperes. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are compared with wind tunnel tests for angles of attack between -5 and 25 degrees and elevon deflections between -10 and 10 degrees. Results show the aerodynamics is dominated by leading edge flow separation and vortex lift. At a centre of gravity location of 44.4% of the vehicle length, stability is observed up to 22 degrees angle of attack. Past this point, instability occurs due to vortex breakdown. The centre of gravity aft stability limit was found at 53.1% of the vehicle length. Overall, good agreement is seen between simulation and tunnel data, validating the modelling methods used. The low speed demonstrator can achieve trimmed flight from 12 m/s, but is only speed stable above 19 m/s. A cruise speed of 19 m/s is selected and can be attained with approximately -9.2 degrees of elevon and 7.1 degrees AoA for a centre of gravity location of 44.4%. Shifting the centre of gravity aft can reduce the trim angle of attack to below 6 degrees with -4 degrees elevon deflection. Take-off and landing can be achieved at 15 m/s between 9.8 and 12 degrees angle of attack, depending on centre of gravity configuration. A maximum climb rate of 2.1 m/s is predicted at 16.3 mks based on the power settings tested. Overall, the results show the aircraft satisfies stability and performance requirements in the longitudinal axis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Transport aircraft,2020
A Study on Means of Compliance for Lightning Protection in the System and Structure of Air Vehicles,"The average probability of a lightning strike to transport aircraft operating in airline service has been estimated to be approximately one strike in every year (or one strike per 1,000 through 20,000 flight hours). The important thing is not the probability of a lightning strike to aircraft, but the fact that aircraft is struck by lightning. Therefore, lightning protection design for aircraft should be qualified and compliance with airworthiness standards related to lightning protection must be substantiated in the process of certification. In this paper, I studied means of compliance for lightning protection through analysis of some test cases, including the KC-100 airplane that firstly obtained civil type certificate in Korea. Based on this paper, it will be also necessary to study on the effect of lightning for space launch vehicles.",Transport aircraft,2020
The Potential of Flight: US Aviation and Pan-Americanism During the Early Twentieth Century,"This article examines the formative years of flight in the United States and argues that Pan-Americanism served as a guiding ideology in the development of the nation's early aeronautic endeavors. With the advent of the airplane at the turn of the twentieth century, U.S. Pan-Americanists believed that aviation would provide a solution to the sociological and practical problems that hindered the development of international unity among the American republics. By physically transporting individuals, products, and cultural media rapidly across the hemisphere via the sky, aircraft would unite the peoples of Latin America and the United States and promote inter-American cooperation. To see the Pan-American potential of aircraft fulfilled, Pan-Americanists cooperated with private U.S. aviation organizations to expound the value of flight and to generate interest in aviation across the Western Hemisphere. Although a variety of Pan-American initiatives were successfully undertaken during the 1910s, the outbreak of the First World War hindered the movement and ultimately led to the transformation of aviation into a tool of U.S. imperialism in Latin America. By examining the origins of U.S. aviation through the lens of Pan-Americanism, this article seeks to reevaluate the pervading imperial narrative of the history of U.S. aviation in the Western Hemisphere.",Transport aircraft,2020
Impact Analysis of Demand Management on Runway Configuration in Metroplex Airports,"Congestion in airports and metroplexes is increasingly becoming a key bottleneck in the global air transport system. It is largely due to inefficient utilization of runway resources and its consequences of imbalance between demand and capacity. Existing studies mainly focus on runway configuration in a single airport system, and little consideration is given to the impact of demand management on runway configuration in metroplexes. Therefore, this paper proposes a methodology and assessment framework for runway configuration with a focus on the exploitation of multiple active runways in metroplex airports. The primary innovation is an integrated runway configuration management formulation with air traffic demand management options. The first is static and dynamic runway configuration management models featuring three optimization objectives, four cases of demand-capacity imbalance, three air traffic demand management options and three assessment scenarios, for eleven priority settings. The second is an efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with a mechanism of objective-guided individual selection, which can obtain close-to optimal solutions with a very low computational cost within 6 seconds. Computational experiments for the real-world case of the Shanghai metroplex airports show that, the inducing strategy of minimizing the total number of adjusted flights is the best mechanism for making satisfactory tradeoffs among multiple objectives in dynamic runway configuration. The proposed model reduces the total number of adjusted flights by an average of 36% compared with the baseline static runway configuration management. Furthermore, unlike the conventional approach of giving priority to arriving aircraft, a higher priority for departures is more effective in enhancing the performance of runway systems and reducing the number of adjusted flights. The proposed framework can be applied at pre-tactical (e.g., one-day planning) as well as tactical (e.g., several-hours rolling horizon) levels.",Transport aircraft,2020
Novel Lyapunov-Based Autonomous Controllers for Quadrotors,"In this paper, we look into the dynamic motion planning and control of an unmanned aerial vehicle, namely, the quadrotor, governed by its dynamical equations. It is shown for the first time that the Direct or the Second Method of Lyapunov is an effective tool to derive a set of continuous nonlinear control laws that not only provide smooth trajectories from a designated initial position to a designated target, but also continuously minimise the roll and pitch of the quadrotor en route to its targets. The latter successfully addresses the challenging problem of a quadrotor autonomously transporting valuable and fragile payloads safely to the designated target. Computer simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control laws.",Transport aircraft,2020
Novel Approach for Detecting the Neurological or Behavioral Impact of Physiological Episodes (PEs) in Military Aircraft Crews,"Introduction Military and civil aviation have documented physiological episodes among aircrews. Therefore, continued efforts are being made to improve the internal environment. Studies have shown that exposures to many organic compounds present in emissions are known to cause a variety of physiological symptoms. We hypothesize that these compounds may reversibly inhibit acetylcholinesterase, which may disrupt synaptic signaling. As a result, neural proteins leak through the damaged blood-brain barrier into the blood and in some, elicit an autoimmune response.Materials and Methods Neural-specific autoantibodies of immunoglobulin-G (IgG) class were estimated by the Western blotting technique in the sera of 26 aircrew members and compared with the sera of 19 normal healthy nonaircrew members, used as controls.Results We found significantly elevated levels of circulating IgG-class autoantibodies to neurofilament triplet proteins, tubulin, microtubule-associated tau proteins (Tau), microtubule-associated protein-2, myelin basic protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, but not S100 calcium-binding protein B compared to healthy controls.Conclusion Repetitive physiological episodes may initiate cellular injury, leading to neuronal degeneration in selected individuals. Diagnosis and intervention should occur at early postinjury periods. Use of blood-based biomarkers to assess subclinical brain injury would help in both diagnosis and treatment.",Transport aircraft,2020
A Computer Vision-Based Navigation and Localization Method for Station-Moving Aircraft Transport Platform with Dual Cameras,"In order to develop equipment adapted to the aircraft pulse final assembly line, a vision-based aircraft transport platform system is developed. This article explores a guiding method between assembly stations which is low-cost and easy to change routes by using two-dimensional code and two complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. The two cameras installed on the front and back of the platform read the two-dimensional code containing station information to guide the platform. In the process of guiding, the theoretical position and posture of the platform at each assembly station are known, but there is a difference between the actual and theoretical values due to motion errors. To reduce the influence of the deviation on the navigation route, a localization method is proposed based on the two-dimensional images captured by the cameras. Canny edge detection is applied to the processed image to obtain the position of the two-dimensional code in the image, which can measure the angle/distance deviation of the platform. Then, the computer can locate the platform precisely by the information in the two-dimensional code and the deviation measured by the image. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, experiments have been performed on the developed platform system. The results show that the distance and angle errors of the platform are within +/- 10 mm and +/- 0.15 degrees respectively.",Transport aircraft,2020
Hybrid Electric Propulsion Using Doubly Fed Induction Machines,"This paper considers a hybrid electric propulsion architecture where most of the electric power is transmitted from the generator to the motors without conversion. Doubly fed induction machines are chosen for generation and propulsion, due to their ability to operate over a range of speeds using reduced-size power converters. The focus of this paper is on the presentation and demonstration of a strategy that allows for the stable and independent operation of multiple motors using the power produced by a single generator. The control methodology includes synchronization, soft-start, and closed-loop speed control of each motor as a means of controlling output thrust. The validation is carried out on a low-power test bed using fractional horsepower machines. The success obtained at a small-scale suggests that the proposed strategy would be worth evaluating at higher power levels, with a potential application to commercial transport aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2020
Study on Initial Disturbance of Airborne Missile's Horizontal Backward Derailment under Continuous Gust,"This paper studies the effect of continuous gusts on the initial disturbance of the airborne missile's horizontal backward derailment on large transport aircraft. The longitudinal fluctuation of the airborne launching platform under continuous gust was obtained with different calculation methods, and the finite element model of the derailing process was established then verified by experiments. Finally, combined with the longitudinal fluctuation of the launching platform and the finite element model of the missile and launching platform, the influence of platform fluctuation on separation time, missile speed, pitch angle, and descending distance while derailing was studied and analyzed. It is found that the longitudinal fluctuation of the launching platform is similar to that of the gust but lags behind, and the missiles under the fluctuating platform have longer separation time, lower derailing speed, and greater derailing pitch angle and descending distance.",Transport aircraft,2019
Adaptive LFT control of a civil aircraft with online frequency-domain parameter estimation,"This paper describes the application of an indirect linear fractional transformation (LFT)-based state-space adaptive control scheme to a transport aircraft, within the context of the European project REconfiguration of CONtrol in Flight for Integral Global Upset REcovery. The principle of the scheme is to design and validate off-line a gain-scheduled controller, depending on the plant parameters to be estimated, and to combine it online with a model estimator, so as to minimize the onboard computational time and complexity. A modal approach, very classical for the design of a flight control law, is used to directly synthesize the static output feedback LFT controller, depending on the control and stability derivatives, ie, the parameters of the linearized aerodynamic state-space model to be estimated. Since the gain-scheduled LFT controller online depends on the parameter estimates instead of the true values, its robustness to transient and asymptotic estimation errors needs to be assessed using mu and integral quadratic constraint analysis techniques. A primary concern being an online implementation, a fully recursive frequency-domain estimation technique is proposed, with a low online computational burden and the capability to track time-varying parameters. Full nonlinear simulations along a trajectory validate the good performance properties of the combined estimator and gain-scheduled flight controller. To some extent, minimal guaranteed stability and performance properties of the adaptive scheme can be ensured by switching to a robust controller when the parameter estimates are not reliable enough, thus bypassing the Certainty Equivalence Principle.",Transport aircraft,2019
Mechanism/structure/aerodynamic multidisciplinary optimization of flexible high-lift devices for transport aircraft,"Mission adaptive variable camber wing in both chord-wise and span-wise directions that can improve the aerodynamic performance during takeoff, landing and cruising flight, will be the state-of-the-art high-lift system for next generation airliners. Based on NASA TrapWing model released on the 1st AIAA CFD High-lift Prediction Workshop, a smart high-lift system with ""Flexible Droop Nose & Single Slotted Hinge Flap combined with spoiler deflection & Flexible Trailing Edge Flap"" is proposed in this paper. The Flexible Droop Nose is actuated by kinematic chains mechanism, the Single Slotted Hinge Flap is actuated by I simple hinge mechanism and the Flexible Trailing Edge Flap is actuated by link/track mechanism.A mechanism/structure/aerodynamic multidisciplinary optimization platform based on iSIGHT software is constructed for this smart high-lift system. This platform consists of stress analysis, high-lift configuration generation, high-lift configuration structure grid generation, computational fluid dynamics and optimization algorithm modules. The optimal takeoff and landing configurations with comprehensive performance of mechanism, aerodynamic and structure is then obtained after multidisciplinary optimization. Finally, the CFD results show that the aerodynamics performance of this smart high-lift system is more effective than the original NASA TrapWing model. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Application of Agile Model-Based Systems Engineering in aircraft conceptual design,"One of the challenges of modern engineering design is the amount of data that designers must keep track while performing system analysis and synthesis. This task is particularly important in the design process of complex systems such as novel aerospace systems where Modeling and Simulation play an essential role. The Agile philosophy stems from the field of Software Engineering and describes an approach to development in which requirements and solutions gradually develop through collaboration between self-organising cross-functional teams and end users. Agile Model-Based System Engineering (AMBSE) is the application of the Agile philosophy to Model-Based System Engineering. In this paper, AMBSE is accomplished through the application of the Object-Oriented System Engineering Method (OOSEM). OOSEM employs a top-down scenario-driven process that adopts System Modeling Language (SysML) and leverages the object-oriented paradigm to support the analysis, specification, design, and verification of systems. AMBSE assisted by mathematical modelling and safety assessment techniques is applied to the first design iterations of the main aircraft systems, allowing a comprehensive design exploration. The flight control system was chosen to illustrate the procedure in detail, emphasising the synthesis of a six-degrees-of-freedom model augmented by dynamic inversion control for a hypothetical supersonic transport aircraft satisfying class II MIL-F-8785C handling qualities. It is concluded that AMBSE presents promising properties to support future aircraft development within the current regulatory framework for aircraft design, while enabling a smooth transition from conceptual to preliminary design.",Transport aircraft,2019
Switching Control Architecture with Parametric Optimization for Aircraft Upset Recovery,"This paper describes a novel finite-state conditional switching structure that enables autonomous recovery for a large envelope of loss-of-control conditions. The switching control architecture mimics human pilot recovery actions through numerous discrete states that are activated individually as the recovery proceeds, based on guidelines inspired by the Federal Aviation Administration's suggestions for piloted upset recovery. The switching conditions between discrete states are optimized using interpolation algorithms that extend the recovery envelope while decreasing the average recovery time. The presented architecture is tested on a high-fidelity transport aircraft model under various initial angles of attack, sideslip and roll angles, and roll/pitch/yaw rates. Comparisons with previous methods are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a greater recoverability percentage and lower average recovery time. In addition, the proposed switching architecture is implemented on a high-fidelity F-16 model, and an example recovery scenario is given to demonstrate the implementation of our approach for an agile fighter aircraft model.",Transport aircraft,2019
Wake Turbulence Evolution and Hazard Analysis for General Aviation Takeoff Accident,"Wake turbulence is commonly a commercial aviation topic involving relatively heavy transport aircraft. However, wake turbulence is also safety relevant for business and general aviation flight operations. A detailed analysis has been conducted for a specific accident involving two aircraft of the wake turbulence category light. A four-seat aircraft with 1 ton maximum takeoff weight took off behind a biplane with 5.5 ton maximum takeoff weight. This led to a fatal accident. Based on available information and several assumptions, the wake turbulence aspects for the specific accident scenario have been assessed. The roll axis was the dominating factor in this case. Accordingly, the wake induced rolling moment was analyzed and related to the assumed available roll control power. Furthermore, the wake vortex behavior was simulated and analyzed in detail. The results indicate that wake turbulence can be considered to be the cause of the accident. The theoretical results and the conclusions regarding the accident are also supported by the results of flight tests, which were conducted in the context of the accident investigation.",Transport aircraft,2019
Vertical flight profile optimization for a cruise segment with RTA constraints,"This paper presents the results of a research performed at the Research Laboratory in Active Controls, Avionics and Aeroservoelasticty (LARCASE), at ETS, concerning optimisation strategies for cruise flight segments with imposed flight time (delimited by waypoints with required time of arrival constraints). Specifically, a new algorithm is presented that identifies the optimal vertical navigation profile (flight altitude and speed optimisation) for a cruise segment with imposed lateral navigation profile, bounded by two waypoints with required time of arrival constraints. The set of evaluated vertical navigation profiles are characterised by identical altitudes and speeds at their initial and final waypoints (at the beginning and the end of the cruise segment under optimisation), a maximum of one altitude step (relative to the initial altitude), and are flown at constant speed. This study investigates the flight performance increase (total cost reduction) for a flight along the optimal vertical navigation profile, relative to a flight at the optimal speed and initial cruise altitude. The evaluation was performed using a medium haul transport aircraft flight performance model, for three lateral navigation profiles and three wind profiles. The algorithm is targeted for Flight Management Systems platforms, to provide the optimal flight trajectory for the imposed lateral flight profile and time constraints.",Transport aircraft,2019
High-fidelity aerostructural optimization of tow-steered composite wings,"Over the past several decades, composites have increasingly become the material of choice in modern aircraft structural design. This is primarily due to the high stiffness-and strength-to-weight ratios offered by conventional composites when compared to metals. Unconventional composite designs, such as tow-steered composites, have demonstrated potential for further expanding these advantages. Unlike their conventional composite counterparts, tow-steered composites feature layers with spatially varying fiber orientations. When applied to wing design, tow-steered composites offer an increase in design freedom at the cost of higher design complexity, making them ideal candidates for design optimization. We develop a methodology for the aerostructural design optimization of tow-steered composite wings using high-fidelity physics models. We also quantify the benefits of this new technology by performing a fuel burn minimization for both a tow-steered and a conventional composite wing design. This assessment is done for the undeflected Common Research Model, which is representative of a twin-aisle transport aircraft. We find improvements of up to 2.4% in fuel burn and 24% in wing weight relative to the optimized conventional composite design. We show that this improvement is due to a combination of improved passive aeroelastic tailoring and local strength tailoring in high-stress regions in the tow-steered structure. For a higher-aspect-ratio (13.5) wing design, we find improvements of up to 1.5% and 14% in fuel savings and wing weight, respectively. To better understand the effect of aspect ratio on tow-steered wing design, we perform an optimization study where the aspect ratio is varied between 7.5 and 13.5. We found that there are diminishing returns in the benefit of tow steering as the aspect ratio is increased because less passive load alleviation is possible. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensitivity of Aeroservoelastic Stability Characteristics Using Parametric Flutter Margins,"The recently developed parametric flutter margin method is expanded to perform efficient sensitivity studies in which linear and nonlinear flutter characteristics are calculated for changes in selected parameters. Two approaches are suggested: one for structural, aerodynamic, or control parameters that can be formulated as single-input/single-output feedback loops and one for parameters that require multiple-input/multiple-output realization. The single-input/single-output analysis is based on frequency response functions, with the formulation aiming to track the important flutter mechanisms, and is arranged such that the sensitivity to different parameters, over large-variation ranges, may be based on the same set of response functions. The multiple-input/multiple-output analysis is similarly effective but is based on eigensolutions that indicate the parametric changes needed to obtain flutter. Three numerical examples using a generic transport aircraft model, in which sensitivity with respect to stiffness and mass variations were studied, are presented. The single-input/single-output and multiple-input/multiple-output approaches are also applied for calculating damping and frequency variations with velocity that may be used as traditional V - g plots in aeroelastic design and certification tasks. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with those obtained by separate p - k solutions of the MSC/NASTRAN code and nonlinear time marching simulations.",Transport aircraft,2019
Identification of In-Flight Wingtip Folding Effects on the Roll Characteristics of a Flexible Aircraft,"Wingtip folding is a means by which an aircraft's wingspan can be extended, allowing designers to take advantage of the associated reduction in induced drag. This type of device can provide other benefits if used in flight, such as flight control and load alleviation. In this paper, the authors present a method to develop reduced order flight dynamic models for in-flight wingtip folding, which are suitable for implementation in real-time pilot-in-the-loop simulations. Aspects such as the impact of wingtip size and folding angle on aircraft roll dynamics are investigated along with failure scenarios using a time domain aeroservoelastic framework and an established system identification method. The process discussed in this paper helps remove the need for direct connection of complex physics based models to engineering flight simulators and the need for tedious programming of large look-up-tables in simulators. Instead, it has been shown that a generic polynomial model for roll aeroderivatives can be used in small roll perturbation conditions to simulate the roll characteristics of an aerodynamic derivative based large transport aircraft equipped with varying fold hinge lines and tip deflections. Moreover, the effects of wing flexibility are also considered.",Transport aircraft,2019
Boundary-layer transition of advanced fighter wings at high-speed cruise conditions,"The achievement of laminar flow in the boundary layer at high-speed cruise conditions may further, in addition to shock-wave control, reduce the drag and extend the range of military fighter aircraft. To this end, a further investigation on transitional boundary-layer flow of fighter wings is needed due to different configurations from the wings used on conventional transport aircraft. In this paper, wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations were conducted on three-dimensional transition of thin diamond-shaped wings used on advanced fighter aircraft at tran/supersonic design points. A newly proposed correlation of crossflow transition which includes the effect of surface roughness was introduced into the gamma-Re-theta t transition model. Predicted results were in good agreement with flow visualizations. Results showed that the strength of the crossflow component grew rapidly around the leading edge because of the severe flow acceleration, just as the same as wings with a large aspect ratio. However, there seemed no regular pattern of instabilit-dominance variation in span-wise for a diamond configuration. The dominance of different instability mechanisms strongly depended on the local pressure distribution. Hereby, the research recommended a ""roof-like"" shape of pressure distribution to suppress both crossflow and Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) instabilities. Besides, a sharp suction peak with a serious pressure rise should be cut off to avoid stronger instabilities. Further discussions also revealed an independence of the unit Reynolds number when transition was triggered by T-S instabilities. Aerodynamic force comparisons indicated that further benefit on drag reduction could be expected by including the three-dimensional transition effect into a wing design process.

Higher-Order Estimations of Load Factor from Derived Gust Velocity,"Pratt's formula, in which the aircraft is modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom system, is used extensively to extract derived gust velocities from measured normal acceleration. There is evidence that airframe mass distribution along the longitudinal axis can affect the gust load alleviation factor. In this paper, the inclusion of the pitching degree of freedom in the model is explored, accounting for the aircraft mass distribution along the longitudinal axis. Two different two-degree-of-freedom models are presented and numerical solutions are offered. Atypical heavy transport aircraft is used for illustration. It is shown that the inclusion of the second degree of freedom results in as much as 10% reduction in the magnitude of the gust load alleviation factor.",Transport aircraft,2019
Using the Reynolds Stress Model to Predict Shock-Induced Separation on Transport Aircraft,"Additional results about the wing-body of the NASA Common Research Model at flight conditions derived from those of the AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop are introduced in this Paper. An initial assessment compared the widely used shear stress transport model with the full Reynolds stress model as two possible closures for the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes problem. The study, based on the 6th AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop, confirmed the limitations of linear eddy-viscosity turbulence models in highly anisotropic turbulent flows. A side-of-body separation larger than previous experiments was predicted by the shear stress transport model. By comparison, the study revealed that the Reynolds stress model is capable of simulating higher-incidence transonic flight as the trends observed in the results were in overall good agreement with the experiment. The aim herein was to investigate the high-incidence transonic aerodynamics about the Common Research Model. Using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes closed with the Reynolds stress model, the aeroelastically deformed Common Research Model was then simulated at incidences outside of the Drag Prediction Workshop remit. The evolution of shock-induced boundary-layer separation was observed. A separation bubble was first predicted at an incidence of 3.5 deg, then developed in the chordwise and spanwise directions, triggering the stall of the aircraft at an incidence of 5.75 deg. Using shear lines helps one understand the three-dimensionality of this phenomenon as large areas of crossflow are present, starting in the wing-kink region and extending toward the wing tip.",Transport aircraft,2019
Structural Optimization of Internal Structure of Aircraft Wings with Curvilinear Spars and Ribs,"A new framework for optimization of the internal structure of transport aircraft wings having curvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs) is described. SpaRibs are parameterized by third-order B-splines with constraints on the starting, ending, and various control points. A broad range of SpaRibs topologies can be created using a limited number of parameters. For local size optimization, panels are generated from the wing finite element model by an algorithm that is independent of the nodal coordinates and the order in which the elements are distributed, and which can be used for a broad range of aircraft wings. The local panel thicknesses are optimized to satisfy buckling and stress constraints of the wing using an algorithm that increases the thickness of the panels that are found to be vulnerable to buckling or wherein the stress is higher than the maximum permissible stress. This algorithm has been integrated with the particle swarm algorithm to optimize the SpaRibs topology for multiple objectives (weight and flutter velocity). The code is demonstrated by optimizing the internal structure of the NASA Common Research Model wing model with SpaRibs considering stress and buckling constraints at trim condition at Mach number equal to 0.85 for two different angles of attack (-2 and 6 deg).",Transport aircraft,2019
A neuroadaptive architecture for model reference control of uncertain dynamical systems with performance guarantees,"Neuroadaptive control systems have the capability to approximate unstructured system uncertainties on a given compact set using neural networks. Yet, a challenge in their design is to guarantee the closed-loop system trajectories stay in this set such that the universal function approximation property is satisfied and the overall system stability is achieved. To address this challenge, we present and analyze a new neuroadaptive architecture in this paper for model reference control of uncertain dynamical systems with strict performance guarantees. Specifically, the proposed architecture is predicated on a novel set-theoretic framework and has the capability to keep the closed-loop system trajectories within an a-priori, user-defined compact set without violating the universal function approximation property. A transport aircraft example is also given to complement the presented theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Transport aircraft,2019
Constraint aggregation for large number of constraints in wing surrogate-based optimization,"The method of aggregating a large number of constraints into one or few constraints has been successfully applied to wing structural design using gradient-based local optimization. However, numerical difficulties may occur in the case that the local curvatures of the aggregated constraint become extremely large and then ill-conditioned Hessian matrix may be yielded. This paper aims to test different methods of constraint aggregation within the framework of a gradient-free optimization, which makes use of cheap-to-evaluate surrogate models to find the global optimum. Three constraint aggregation approaches are investigated: the maximum constraint approach, the constant parameter Kreisselmeier-Steinhauser (KS) function, and the adaptive KS function. We also explore methods of aggregating constraints over the entire structure and within sub-domains. Examples of structural optimization and aero-structural optimization for a transport aircraft wing are employed and the results show that (1) the KS function with a larger constant parameter rho can lead to better optimization results than the adaptive method, as the active constraints are approximated more accurately; (2) lumping the constraints within sub-domains instead of all together can improve the accuracy of the aggregated constraint and therefore helps find a better design. Finally, it is concluded from current test cases that the most efficient way of handling large-scale constraints for wing surrogate-based optimization is to aggregate constraints within sub-domains and with a relatively large constant parameter.",Transport aircraft,2019
Integral sliding mode fault-tolerant control allocation for a class of affine nonlinear system,"This paper develops novel fault-tolerant integral sliding mode control allocation schemes for a class of an overactuated affine nonlinear system. The proposed schemes rely on an existing baseline controller, and the objective is to retain the nominal (fault-free) closed-loop performance in the face of actuator faults/failures by effectively utilizing actuator redundancy. The online control allocation reroutes the control effort to healthy actuators using the knowledge of actuator effectiveness level estimates. One of the proposed schemes is tested in simulation using a well-known high-fidelity model of a large civil transport aircraft (B747) from the literature. Good simulation results show the efficacy of the scheme.",Transport aircraft,2019
Application of Low Harmonic 18-Pulse Rectifier Power Supply for Radar Power System,"Due to its low harmonic, high efficiency, and high power factor (PF), the multipulse autotransformer has been frequently used in the aviation sector. Many studies have been carried out on the theoretical calculation and simulation analysis of the autotransformer. However, the practical application of the multipulse rectifier in the practical engineering field is inevitable. This paper investigates an 18-pulse rectifier power supply of 11 kW being constructed using a multipulse autotransformer to suppress the harmonics of a radar power system, in which the parameters of the various parts are designed in detail, and test results are simulated using MATLAB/Simulink software. The actual test suggests that, at the rated condition, the PF of the rectifier is 0.99, the total harmonic distortion of the input current is below 6.7%, and the efficiency is more than 96%. The power supply is successfully applied to the radar power supply system of a large transport aircraft, and meets the requirements of an environmental test. Furthermore, the results also provide powerful application support for the power supplies and distribution systems in other fields.",Transport aircraft,2019

Development of structural health monitoring methods through the analysis of kinetics of local stressstrain state,"The paper describes one of the most promising ways of structure health monitoring based on analysis of the kinetics of local stress-strain state. Comparison with other methods of damage detection and advantages of the stress-strain state control are considered. To implement this method of monitoring, two types of sensors are considered: strain gauges and fiber Bragg gratings (FBG). The advantages of FBG, due to which their use in operation is most preferable, are presented. The possibility of using stress-strain state control is analyzed for a promising transport aircraft using the results of tensometry under cyclic loading. The relevance of the work is confirmed by various examples of using monitoring methods in on-board systems during operation. The possibility of monitoring the airframe parts is demonstrated for longitudinal fuselage joints as an example. The change in the stress-strain state of the longitudinal joints, caused by structural damage was confirmed by tensometry analysis and by analysis of the stress-strain state of bearing sheet by the finite element method (FEM), taking into account the fatigue cracks originated during cyclic loading. The results of the calculation are compared with the tensometry data. Proceeding from the results of the calculation of the stress-strain state of the damaged and undamaged structure, the zones of the greatest deformation change are determined to optimize potential locations for the sensors. The optimal placing of the sensors for monitoring the integrity of the joints is proposed. The study confirms that the method of damage monitoring of the structure, developed on the basis of changes in the kinetics of the stress-strain state, can be successfully used in tests for maintaining the integrity of joints and other places with multi-site damages, where the methods of visual and non-destructive testing are not effective.",Transport aircraft,2019
Experience in the conversion of light transport aircraft into the sanitary version,"The urgency of the problem of rational use for the purpose of medical evacuation of various aircraft, taking into account their equipment and radius of the aircraft, is shown.

Model-Based Systems Engineering for Aircraft Design With Dynamic Landing Constraints Using Object-Process Methodology,"We present a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) framework using object-process methodology (OPM, ISO 19450) for civil transport aircraft design with dynamic landing constraints. The framework integrates the aircraft system development life cycle processes into a holistic MBSE model, incorporating into it the specific aircraft dynamic loads model-based design (MBD) domain. Using this framework, we also perform model-based requirements analysis, validation, and verification. The model parameter set is governed by a unified format used for both the MBSE and MBD domains. The resulting model enables aircraft design processes to start being formalized at the early conceptual design stage and carry on to detailed design, adding value to system lifecycle processes by integrating and streamlining the MBSE and MBD domains into a more holistic framework with seamless transition between these two major stages.",Transport aircraft,2019
Impact of spanwise non-uniform discrete gusts on civil aircraft loads,"The drive for increasing flight efficiency is resulting in wing designs that are of higher aspect ratios, lower in weight, increased wingspans and, consequently, require greater attention in the disciplines of aeroelastics and loads. This trend in aircraft design, along with past research experience with flexible aircraft, motivate a review of assumptions in gust models; especially, that of the gust maintaining a uniform spanwise profile. In this paper, the authors investigate the use of spanwise varying 1 - cos gust models for loads prediction using a non-linear aeroelastic model of a conventional large transport aircraft. The comparison between a test case using conventional uni-dimensional approach and another, using multidimensional gusts, illustrates the impact of stepping away from traditional discrete tuned gust processes and adding a spanwise varying gust component. A methodology for processing and analysing the loads data arising due to the added dimension is also developed and both envelope and correlated loads are considered. Gust characteristics and resulting load factor are, respectively, considered for comparison between the two models, as both metrics define realistic gust encounters. In this case, it has been shown that spanwise variation of gust profiles leads to lower envelope loads if viewed in terms of conventional gust gradients. However, higher envelope loads are found if the maximum load factors are matched.",Transport aircraft,2019
Barrier Lyapunov function-based robust flight control for the ultra-low altitude airdrop under airflow disturbances,"This paper investigates the anti-disturbance constrained trajectory flight control for the ultra-low altitude airdrop under airflow disturbances, by innovatively integrating the finite time convergent high-order sliding mode observer and barrier Lyapunov function-based back-stepping technique. The dynamics of transport aircraft during the airdrop are established based on the fixed-wing aircraft's 6 DOF nonlinear model and are transformed into the affine nonlinear form for the convenient control design. These dynamics include the complex influence of the flow disturbances, the ground effect, the consecutive movement and abrupt extraction of the heavy cargo. Then, the flight controller is divided into several cascade subsystems via back-stepping technique. The items reflect the disturbances during the drop in each subsystem, as well as the items which are independent of the predefined virtual control variables, are taken as components of the ""lumped disturbances"" which are estimated and compensated by the specially designed finite time convergent high order sliding mode observer. On this basis, a barrier Lyapunov function-based back-stepping flight controller is proposed for the robust and safe flight control of the ultra-low altitude airdrop. And the closed-loop stability is discussed via the Lyapunov stability theorem. Simulation comparisons are conducted to verify the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed airdrop flight control method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Design and cost analysis of integration of fluidic oscillator into a flap structure,"Integration of active flow control technology into civil transport aircraft is a highly desired objective due to the potential reductions in part count, weight, and recurring manufacturing costs. This study develops an optimal design for integrating a fluidic oscillator into the leading-edge of a trailing-edge flap structure on a civil transport aircraft. The design incorporates design specifications set by members of the aerospace industry, robust design methodologies, and simulation studies to create three separate designs that can be mass-produced. An analysis of the manufacturing, assembly, material, and weight reveals the cost of the design with respect to its production rate, which ranges from about $4090 per aircraft for low-production volumes to about $2600 per aircraft for high-production volumes. As a result, this study provides a basis for the design of manufacturing and assembly techniques to integrate active flow control technology into civil transport aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2018
Investigation on the benefit of formation flight with a focus on the leading and trailing aircraft rotation,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the potential advantages of aircraft formation flight (FF) and to exploit further benefits through exchanging the leading positions.Design/methodology/approach - The detailed and robust methodologies concerning FF mission analysis including the leading aircraft rotation strategies are developed in this paper to study the fuel burn benefit and the additional bonus of formation rotation.Findings - Switch of FF leading positions can offset the undesired weight ratios between the leading and trailing aircraft within FF missions, which further alleviates the deviations from design flight conditions. The case studies on two long-range civil transport aircraft in FF show that the leading and trailing aircraft can achieve almost equal fuel benefit through rotations. As compared to FF without rotation, the fuel efficiency can be improved by more than 11 per cent.Research limitations/implications - The work can bring benefit the research communities as a fundamental basis for operational studies of FF, such as FF airspace management in the future, which is significant for a future real-world implementation of FFs.Practical implications - According to the authors' study, equal or quasi-equal fuel savings can be achieved if the rotation is properly arranged. For the real-world FF application, fuel consumption (FC) or cost redistribution problem for leading and trailing aircraft belonging to two different operating airlines can therefore be resolved through the concept proposed by the paper.Originality/value - The methods developed in the paper have the advantage to give more reliable estimations of the achievable fuel burn savings of FF. The concept proposed in the paper has significant meaning with respect to offset the undesired weight ratios between the leading and trailing aircraft within FF missions and redistributing FC or cost redistribution of different operating airlines.",Transport aircraft,2018
Analysis of the Aerodynamic Benefit from Boundary Layer Ingestion for Transport Aircraft,"Propulsors with boundary layer ingestion (BLI) generate a propulsive force with lower flow power input than conventional engines. This aerodynamic benefit can be traced back to its sources: reductions in jet, surface, and wake dissipation. A framework for BLI analysis is developed based on the power balance method: parametric expressions are derived for the net streamwise force on an aircraft and for the mechanical flow power required, as well as relations for the dissipation components. They illustrate the range of possible comparisons between BLI and non-BLI engine installations, and show how the benefit varies with design choices. Applying the framework to wind tunnel data from powered D8 aircraft model tests, the sources of aerodynamic BLI benefit are quantified for a realistic transport aircraft configuration. With the same propulsors (equal nozzle area) BLI reduces cruise power by 8.2%, of which 5.2% comes from a reduction in jet dissipation, 2.4% from reduced surface dissipation, and 0.6% from reduced wake dissipation. The jet dissipation reduction is equivalent to a 3.4 percentage points increase in propulsive efficiency. If the installations are compared at equal mass flow, the benefit amounts to a 9% lower cruise power.",Transport aircraft,2018
Efficient Aircraft Multidisciplinary Design Optimization and Sensitivity Analysis via Signomial Programming,"This paper proposes a new methodology for physics-based aircraft multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) and sensitivity analysis. The proposed architecture uses signomial programming (SP), a type of difference-of-convex optimization that is solved iteratively as a series of log-convex problems. A requirement of SP is that all constraints and objective functions must have explicit signomial formulas. The SP MDO architecture facilitates the low-cost computation of optimal sensitivities through Lagrange duality. The specific example of commercial aircraft MDO is considered. Using SP, a small-, medium-, and large-scale benchmark problem is solved 16, 39, and 26 times faster, respectively, than Transport Aircraft System Optimization (TASOPT), a comparable and widely used aircraft MDO tool. The SP solution times include computation of all optimal parameter and constraint sensitivities, a feature unique to the presented architecture. The reliability of SP is demonstrated by converging a commercial aircraft MDO problem for a number of different objective functions and evaluating both traditional and nontraditional aircraft configurations. While the presented example is commercial aircraft MDO, the SP MDO architecture is applicable to a range of engineering optimization problems.",Transport aircraft,2018
Optimization of Variable-Camber Continuous Trailing-Edge Flap Configuration for Drag Reduction,"The variable-camber continuous trailing-edge flap is a novel control surface technology designed to serve as an aeroelastic wing shaping control device. Capable of minimizing drag throughout an aircraft flight envelope, use of the variable-camber continuous trailing-edge flap technology is examined on a flexible-wing transport aircraft configuration known as the NASA generic transport model. Drag reduction studies at various flight conditions are conducted in order to examine the performance of different flap configurations with selected camber deflection profiles. Rapid optimization of the design space is achieved by using aerodynamic-structural modeling based on a vortex lattice method coupled with transonic small disturbance and integral boundary-layer solutions. The begin cruise optimization results show that a parabolic flap deflection profile configuration with three-cambered-segments achieves the largest drag reduction of 8.4% as compared to a clean wing configuration. The configuration is used to run additional optimizations measuring performance benefits at different flight conditions including 20% fuel end cruise, a +/- 30% design lift coefficient, and a Mach overspeed condition. The optimization framework and initial results produce insights that can be used to refine the optimization of variable-camber continuous trailing-edge flap configurations with higher-fidelity aerodynamic tools.",Transport aircraft,2018
Preliminary design and optimization for fleet to be used in the Small Air Transport system,"Over the last few years, teams from several research centres have been working on the concept of Small Air Transport, filling the niche between a regular surface transport and a scheduled air transport - on the distances over 200 km, utilizing numerous, though low in volume, passengers' streams - giving regions a chance to improve their communication capabilities. Small Air Transport's tasks are performed on small aeroplanes, which take up to 19 passengers, with a flight time of up to 4 h and at a reasonable price for a mass recipient. An important feature of the Small Air Transport system is personalization, which is flexible adaptation of the transport process to the customer's requirements and capabilities. This paper focuses on the selection and optimization of key parameters of aircraft fleet used in Small Air Transport. The research and analysis were based on the parameters of a reference aircraft selected for each individual class of small aircraft. Taking into account the data of currently used aircraft, the calculations were made to obtain the generalized transport costs per passenger kilometre. The generalized transport costs covers both - the total operating costs and value of time of passengers. As a result of minimizing these costs in terms of the variability of the key design factors of aircraft, the parameters of the recommended aircraft, in particular, classes were obtained. It was found that generalized passenger-kilometre costs for recommended Small Air Transport aircraft are only 20-30% higher than for regional aircraft (with the same load factor) and are more advantageous for Small Air Transport aircraft (lower cost) for small local passenger flows. Utilizing Small Air Transport aircraft, the profitability of air transport expands to significantly less intense passenger flows. The analysis allowed defining key design parameters of aircraft fleet in Small Air Transport in the initial phase of a project.",Transport aircraft,2018
Structural sizing for the weight estimation of a very light aircraft wing,"The design process is no longer a trial-and-error procedure due to the introduction of computer-aided tools and optimization techniques. The product development process is therefore accelerated, allowing to produce more in a relatively lesser time. Moreover, the best possible design, with regard to the performance, can hence be obtained. When applied to the design of an aircraft wing, the optimization objective is usually to minimize the structural weight under failure-based constraints. This paper presents an optimization strategy that allows the determination of the wing surface structural thicknesses corresponding to the minimal weight while keeping the structure safe in terms of strength and buckling. This strategy is applied for the wing sizing process of a new two-seater very light aircraft, currently under development. The design process goes through geometric modeling, aerodynamic calculations using vortex lattice method, and finite element modeling. Structural optimization is performed within MATLAB, and is based on the automatic execution of the finite element solver MSC.NASTRAN.",Transport aircraft,2018
Sizing of hybrid electric propulsion system for retrofitting a mid-scale aircraft using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm,"The paper presents the sizing of a hybrid electric propulsion system for a prototype aircraft. The main contribution of the paper is to apply multi-objective optimization in the retrofit of a mid-scale aircraft and investigate the fuel economy of the hybrid aircraft for a particular mission cycle. Using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA), the fuel consumptions for different flight durations are minimized, which represent the optimal trade-off between fuel consumption and flight duration. With no compromise on endurance and range, the maximum fuel reduction of the retrofitted hybrid aircraft reaches 17.6%, by comparison with the prototype aircraft. The retrofitted aircraft achieves better cruising and climbing performance with the sized hybrid propulsion system. The novelty of the study is the proposal of a new non-dominated sorting algorithm-Benchmark based Non-Dominated Sort (BNDS) for the NSGA. BNDS can reduce the number of comparisons and the time complexity of the non dominated sorting process. A constraint handling approach is also integrated into the BNDS/NSGA to address performance and mission requirements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Transport aircraft,2018
Design of a transonic wing with an adaptive morphing trailing edge via aerostructural optimization,"Novel aircraft configurations and technologies like adaptive morphing trailing edges offer the potential to improve the fuel efficiency of commercial transport aircraft. To accurately quantify the benefits of morphing wing technology for commercial transport aircraft, high-fidelity design optimization that considers both aerodynamic and structural design with a large number of design variables is required. To address this need, we use a high fidelity aerostructural model that enables the detailed optimization of wing shape and sizing using hundreds of design variables. We perform a number of multipoint aerostructural optimizations to demonstrate the performance benefits offered by morphing technology and identify how those benefits are enabled. In a comparison of optimizations considering seven flight conditions, the addition of a morphing trailing edge device along the aft 40% of the wing can reduce cruise fuel burn by more than 5%. A large portion of fuel burn reduction due to morphing trailing edges results from a significant reduction in structural weight, enabled by adaptive maneuver load alleviation. We also show that a smaller morphing device along the aft 30% of the wing produces nearly as much fuel burn reduction as the larger morphing device, and that morphing technology is particularly effective for high aspect ratio wings.

Three-dimensional design of a large-displacement morphing wing droop nose device,"The numerical three-dimensional structural design of a large-displacement flexible morphing wing leading edge, otherwise known as a droop nose, is presented in this article. The droop nose is an essential component of a novel internally blown high-lift system for a transport aircraft to delay stall and reduce internal compressor requirements. A design chain consisting of optimization procedures was used to arrive at the structural design of the droop nose composed of a composite fiberglass skin with integral stringers and supporting kinematic mechanisms. The optimization tools aim to produce a design with minimal error to the critical target shapes. A maximum final error of 10.09 mm between calculated and target trajectories of the stringers was found after the kinematic optimization stage. After inputting the kinematic optimization results into the skin optimization stage and solving, a maximum error in the order of 13 mm and curvature difference 0.0028 I/mm were calculated, occurring in the outboard region. Prior two-dimensional analyses with similar shape deviations showed 0.4% lift reduction though further three-dimensional investigations are required. Concepts for integrating industrial requirements abrasion and lightning strike protection and in-flight de-icing into a multifunctional skin show promise and the resulting aerodynamic surface quality was found to be adequate.",Transport aircraft,2018
Fuzzy Logic Aided Fault-Tolerant Control Applied to Transport Aircraft Subject to Actuator Stuck Failures,"Failure to counteract in-flight actuator stuck failures within a limited amount of time can result in catastrophic consequences. Aircraft safety is also undermined when fault-tolerant control (FTC) systems are designed based on inaccurate diagnostic results. This paper presents an FTC scheme for transport aircraft subject to actuator stuck failures, which is integrated with fuzzy logic system (FLS), real finite-time sliding mode control (RETSMC), and least squares control allocation (LSCA) techniques. First, the term, including the stuck information, is obtained by resorting to an FLS. The norm of the weight matrix is adopted in the FLS estimation, such that the amount of the adaptive parameters is independent of the number of FLS rules. Following this, a virtual fuzzy logic aided FTC strategy is developed using RFTSMC, by which the actuator stuck failure is counteracted within finite time. Furthermore, an LSCA unit is capable of distributing the commands to the fault-free actuators, with explicit consideration of incorrectly identified values of actuator effectiveness indicators. Finally, simulation studies of a nonlinear Boeing 747 longitudinal model are performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",Transport aircraft,2018
Retrospective on the Common Research Model for Computational Fluid Dynamics Validation Studies,"The development of a wing-body-nacelle-pylon-horizontal-tail configuration for a common research model is presented, with the focus on the aerodynamic design of the wing. Acontemporary transonic supercritical wing design is developed with aerodynamic characteristics that are well behaved and of high performance for configurations with and without the nacelle-pylon group. The horizontal tail is robustly designed for dive Mach number conditions and is suitably sized for typical stability and control requirements. The fuselage is representative of a wide-body commercial transport aircraft; it includes a wing-body fairing, as well as a scrubbing seal for the horizontal tail. The nacelle is a single-cowl high-bypass-ratio flowthrough design with an exit area sized to achieve a natural unforced mass flow ratio typical of commercial aircraft engines at cruise. The simplicity of this un-bifurcated unpowered nacelle geometry facilitates experimental data collection and grid generation efforts for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validations. Detailed aerodynamic performance data are provided; however, this information was originally presented in such a manner as to not bias CFD predictions planned for the fourth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop in 2009 (DPW-IV); the DPW-IV incorporated this common research model into its blind test cases. The fifth AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshop in 2012 and the sixth AIAA CFDDrag Prediction Workshop in 2016 also used this configuration as the basis of their test cases. The CFD results presented include wing pressure distributions with and without the nacelle-pylon Mach x lift-to-drag ratio (ML/D) trend lines, as well as the drag-divergence curves. The design point for the wing-body configuration is within 1% of its maximum ML/D. The original plans to test the common research model in the National Transonic Facility at NASA Langley Research Center and the 11-by11 ft wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center are discussed. Furthermore, wind-tunnel models have been replicated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, ONERA-The French Aerospace Lab, the University of Washington, as well as by numerous other laboratories. AWeb site has been established to collect, archive, and freely provide wind-tunnel data from these various experimental campaigns. The geometry definition has been extended to include a high-lift system. It has been used to form the basis for experimental swept-wing icing studies. Finite element models have been developed for the wind-tunnel environment, as well as to be more representative of a full-scale aircraft in flight. A simple search for technical papers related to this configuration yields thousands of results.

Development of Deformed Computer-Aided Design Geometries for the Sixth Drag Prediction Workshop,"A method for modifying the shape of digital geometry representations used in computer-aided design applications according to experimental pointwise deflection data is described. In the pilot study presented here, the method is applied to the computer-aided design geometry of an aircraft wing that is deformed using measured deflections obtained from the associated wing model during a wind-tunnel test. The method provides various advantages in computational fluid dynamics and other applications. Numerical grids generated on the deformed geometry yield an improved correlation of computational fluid dynamics results to wind-tunnel data without the need for aeroelastic computations, which require coupling to a structural model. Additionally, the method is beneficial in aerodynamic optimization, where the optimized shape is usually given in the form of a computational fluid dynamics surface mesh or nodal deflections that, for further processing or manufacturing purposes, need to be transferred into a computeraided design geometry description. The paper presents an application to NASA's Common Research Model transport aircraft configuration, where deformation measurements from a test campaign in the European Transonic Wind Tunnel are processed to provide deformed computer-aided design geometries for the Sixth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop.",Transport aircraft,2018
Summary of Case 5 from Sixth Drag Prediction Workshop: Coupled Aerostructural Simulation,"A summary of participants' results for the coupled aerostructural simulation test case from the Sixth AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Drag Prediction Workshop held in Washington, DC, 16-17 June 2016, is presented. The test case focuses on a static aeroelastic simulation of NASA's Common Research Model civil transport aircraft in the wing/body configuration (i.e., without engines, pylons, and empennage). Flow conditions include the design point lift coefficient C-L = 0.5 +/- 0.0001 at cruise flight. Aeroelastic simulations are performed on the ""medium"" baseline grid, coupled to a computational structural analysis, using either an existing finite element model or modal data. Experimental validation data for this test case are available from a wind-tunnel test campaign performed at the European Transonic Wind Tunnel in Cologne, Germany.",Transport aircraft,2018
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization of Natural-Laminar-Flow Wing Using Surrogate-Based Approach,"Aerodynamic shape optimization of a swept natural-laminar-flow wing in the transonic regime is still challenging. The difficulty is associated with reliable prediction of laminar-turbulence transition and reasonable compromise of viscous and wave drags. This paper proposes to use efficient global optimization based on surrogate models to address this problem. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver features automatic transition prediction via a full e(N) method, in which dual N factors are used for Tollmien-Schlichting and crossflow instabilities, respectively. The optimizer is based on the kriging surrogate model and parallel infill-sampling method. The baseline natural-laminar-flow wing for short- and medium-range transport aircraft is designed at a cruise Mach number 0.75. Then, drag minimization with up to 42 design variables is carried out, and significant drag reduction (8.79%) has been achieved. A close examination of the optimal wing shows that the drag reduction mainly comes from shock-wave weakening on the upper surface and laminar flow extending via suppression of crossflow instability on the lower surface. Robustness of the optimal wing is investigated, and multipoint optimization is further exercised to improve the robustness to the Mach number variation. It is demonstrated that surrogate-based optimization is feasible and effective for aerodynamic shape optimization of transonic natural-laminar-flow wings.",Transport aircraft,2018
Benchmark Aerostructural Models for the Study of Transonic Aircraft Wings,"Since its introduction, the NASA Common Research Model has proved a useful aerodynamic benchmark for predicting computational-fluid-dynamics-based drag and aerodynamic design optimization. The model was originally conceived as a purely aerodynamic benchmark, and as such the wing geometry corresponds to the deflected shape at its nominal 1g flight condition. However, interest has been growing to extend this model to aeroelastic studies. Unfortunately, because of its predefined deflection, the model is not suitable for aeroelastic analysis and design. To address this issue, an undeflected Common Research Model is defined through an inverse design procedure that includes the outer mold line geometry of the undeflected wing and the corresponding internal wingbox structure. Additionally, because modern transport aircraft are trending toward higher-aspect-ratio wing designs, a higher-aspect-ratio variant of the Common Research Model wing is developed to assess next-generation wing designs. This variant has an aspect ratio of 13.5 and is designed by using buffet-constrained multipoint aerostructural optimization. The purpose of these models is to provide publicly available benchmarks for aeroelastic wing analysis and design optimization.",Transport aircraft,2018
Evolving Constructs & Measurements of Aviation Fuel Consumption: An Analytical View,"Aviation fuel is a major stakeholder in total operating cost of air transportation. Increasing competition & challenge to keep the travel expenses low to survive have created interest in fuel consumption reduction. Although interest of researchers for Reduction in Aviation Fuel Consumption (RAFC) is growing, yet no study has undertaken initiative towards a development of RAFC framework and instruments. Therefore, this article is an effort to present measurement models with different variables for estimating the RAFC through non-financial and financial measures. The study, through extensive literature review identifies and integrates various fuel consumption reduction initiatives and measures to develop key RAFC constructs conducive for further improvement in aviation fuel efficiency. The RAFC is sub classified as driving forces measurement model, implementation measurement model and performance measurement model. Factor Analysis (FA) and measurement models were used to investigate various constructs of RAFC. After sequence of tests and analysis, study provide refined measurements with acceptable psychometric properties. These measurements can also be applied to varying contexts to extend conceptualization or to test different conceptual models, advancing RAFC theory building.",Transport aircraft,2018
Unsteady aerodynamic effects in landing operation of transport aircraft and controllability with fuzzy-logic dynamic inversion,"Aircraft landing in strong wind has been a safety problem for all types of aircraft. The specific issues involve hard landing, roll oscillation and runway veer-off. These issues are related to atmospheric disturbances, and/or dynamic ground effect. As a result, the aerodynamics will be different from those in steady flow concept. In this paper, some of the pertinent stability and control derivatives based on a small-disturbance concept will be presented. How these local stability and control characteristics affect global controllability will be examined with Fuzzy-Logic Dynamic Inversion. Controllability is judged from whether necessary control deflections exceed the imposed limits. Specific examples involving a twin-jet transport with hard landing, rolling oscillation before touchdown and runway veer-off event due to varying crosswind after touchdown are illustrated.

Transport Aircraft Seating in Rotorcraft Crash Testing,"The Federal Aviation Administration has regulations designed to protect aircraft occupants in the event of a crash. An impact test of a CH-46 airframe at NASA provided full-scale crash data on the performance of transport category aircraft seating systems. The crash pulse measured at the floor differed from the certification tests, and the performance of the seats did as well. To assess injuries in the spinal column, lumbar loads were collected for all anthropomorphic test devices. The passenger seats remained attached to the floor structure; however, the experimental subfloor structure failed for the forward occupants. The restraint system functioned properly, but the compressive lumbar loads measured were significantly higher than those allowed for the certification tests. This testing demonstrated that seats dynamically qualified for lower impact severities (14g) were able to maintain structural integrity but were not able to control spinal injury risk.",Transport aircraft,2018
Using exergy for performance evaluation of a conceptual ramjet engine burning hydrogen fuel,"Ramjet engines are widely-used devices in the defence industry and have military applications. These engine types, preferred in many fields, are known to act according to the laws of thermodynamics. For this reason, exergy analysis methodology is a beneficial tool for assessing the performance of a ramjet engine, as well as other energy conversion systems. The present study aims to introduce a performance analysis of a hydrogen fueled ramjet engine within the framework of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. At the end of the study, the exergy efficiencies of inlet, combustion zone and nozzle are found to be 3.88%, 7.62%, and 0.03%, respectively, whereas the exergy efficiency of a ramjet engine is 8.85%.

Aerodynamic Design of the Supersonic Aircraft Wing-Shape and Wing-Twist Optimization,"This paper builds an aerodynamic optimization design system by coupling the free form deformation parameterization technique, the dynamic mesh technique based on inverse distance weighting interpolation method and particle swarm optimization algorithm, Kriging surrogate model, with the computational fluid dynamics solver based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. And it carries out aerodynamic optimization designs with a supersonic transport aircraft configuration. The wing shape is parameterized by defining 60 design variables and the wing twist is by four design variables. Meanwhile, the wing thickness constraints are considered. Afterwards, a single-point optimization design aiming at minimum of the supersonic cruise drag is conducted, and in order to consider the transonic cruise condition, a multipoint aerodynamic optimization design aiming at minimum of a weighted drag for the supersonic cruise drag and transonic cruise drag is performed. The analyses of optimization results illustrate the specific drag reduction, the characteristics of pressure distributions for both the supersonic cruise condition and transonic cruise condition, and how the shock wave region and strength have improved on the supersonic cruise condition. The optimization design this paper presents realizing the drag reduction is quite practical and effective, which is instructive in supersonic aircraft design.",Transport aircraft,2018
Rapid Transonic Flutter Analysis for Aircraft Conceptual Design Applications,"This study presents a new approach for the rapid transonic flutter analysis of large-aspect-ratio wings via a combination of time-linearized two-dimensional unsteady indicial functions and a database of steady two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. The approach is limited to large-aspect-ratio wings that can be discretized into multiple, streamwise, independent strips; and the well-documented ""strip theory"" with sweep corrections is applicable. This formulation allows the extension of Leishman's indicial functions (""Validation of Approximate Indicial Aerodynamic Functions for Two-Dimensional Subsonic Flow,"" Journal of Aircraft, Vol.25, No.10, 1988, pp.914-922) to three-dimensional wings but also restricts the present method to attached flows. However, when supported with two-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, the present method predicts flutter speeds that are within 10% of that predicted by two-dimensional time-accurate Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations. Application of the proposed method for a large-aspect-ratio wing is validated by comparing the predicted flutter boundary against wind-tunnel experiments. More importantly, the current method predicts the transonic dip phenomena observed in the experiments but not predicted by NASTRAN analysis. This is achieved at several orders-of-magnitude lower computation time than high-fidelity time-accurate computational fluid dynamics simulations. The level of accuracy obtained at such an extremely low computation time makes the present approach very suitable for applications in conceptual design studies of large-aspect-ratio transonic vehicles.",Transport aircraft,2018
Simulation and Modeling of Rigid Aircraft Aerodynamic Responses to Arbitrary Gust Distributions,"The stresses resulting from wind gusts can exceed the limit value and may cause large-scale structural deformation or even failure. All certified airplanes should therefore withstand the increased loads from gusts of considerable intensity. A large factor of safety will make the structure heavy and less economical. Thus, the need for accurate prediction of aerodynamic gust responses is motivated by both safety and economic concerns. This article presents the efforts to simulate and model air vehicle aerodynamic responses to various gust profiles. The computational methods developed and the research outcome will play an important role in the airplane's structural design and certification. Cobalt is used as the flow solver to simulate aerodynamic responses to wind gusts. The code has a user-defined boundary condition capability that was tested for the first time in the present study to model any gust profile (intensity, direction, and duration) on any arbitrary configuration. Gust profiles considered include sharp edge, one minus cosine, a ramp, and a 1-cosine using tabulated data consisting of gust intensity values at discrete time instants. Test cases considered are a flat plate, a two-dimensional NACA0012 airfoil, and the high Reynolds number aero-structural dynamics (HIRENASD) configuration, which resembles a typical large passenger transport aircraft. Test cases are assumed to be rigid, and only longitudinal gust profiles are considered, though the developed codes can model any gust angle. Time-accurate simulation results show the aerodynamic responses to different gust profiles including transient solutions. Simulation results show that sharp edge responses of the flat plate agree well with the Kussner approximate function, but trends of other test cases do not match because of the thin airfoil assumptions made to derive the analytical function. Reduced order aerodynamic models are then created from the convolution integral of gust amplitude and the time-accurate responses to sharp-edge gusts. Convolution models are next used to predict aerodynamic responses to arbitrary gust profiles without the need of running time-accurate simulations for every gust shape. The results show very good agreement between developed models and simulation data.",Transport aircraft,2018
Distributed Propulsion Aircraft with Aeroelastic Wing Shaping Control for Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency,"This study presents an aeroelastic wing shaping control concept for distributed propulsion aircraft. By leveraging wing flexibility, wing-mounted distributed propulsion can be used to re-twist wing shapes in-flight to improve aerodynamic efficiency. A multidisciplinary approach is used to develop an aero-propulsive-elastic model of a highly flexible wing distributed propulsion transport aircraft. The conceptual model is used to evaluate the aerodynamic benefit of the distributed propulsion aircraft. The initial conceptual analysis shows that an improvement in the aerodynamic efficiency quantity of lift-to-drag ratio L/D is possible with the proposed aeroelastic wing shaping control for distributed propulsion aircraft. Two concepts are studied: single-generator configuration and dualgenerator configuration with four propulsors per wing. The baseline aircraft model is NASA Generic Transport Model. A fan performance analysis is developed for propulsion sizing. Cruise performance analysis is conducted to evaluate the potential improvement in the cruise range for the configurations under study. A flutter analysis is performed to address the potential flutter issue as the propulsors are placed toward the wing tip, which would cause a reduction in the wing natural frequencies. Flight control considerations are addressed in the context of the engine-out requirement, yaw and roll controls, and yaw damping augmentation using differential thrust.",Transport aircraft,2018
Turbofan Engine Sizing and Tradeoff Analysis via Signomial Programming,"This paper presents a full one-dimensional core and fan flowpath turbofan optimization model, based on first principles, and meant to be used during aircraft conceptual design optimization. The model is formulated as a signomial program, which is a type of optimization problem that can be solved locally using sequential convex optimization. Signomial programs can be solved reliably and efficiently and are straightforward to integrate with other optimization models in an all-at-once manner. To demonstrate this, the turbofan model is integrated with a simple commercial aircraft sizing model. The turbofan model is validated against the Transport Aircraft System Optimization turbofan model as well as two Georgia Institute of Technology Numerical Propulsion System Simulation turbofan models. Four integrated engine/aircraft parametric studies are performed, including a multimission optimization with over 2400 variables that solves in under 4 s.",Transport aircraft,2018
Ramjet Nozzle Analysis for Transport Aircraft Configuration for Sustained Hypersonic Flight,"For the past several decades, research dealing with hypersonic flight regimes has been restricted mainly to military applications. Hypersonic transportation could be a possible and affordable solution to travel in the medium term and there is renewed interest from several private organisations for commercial exploitation in this direction. Various combined cycle propulsion configurations have been proposed and the present paper deals with implications for the nozzle component of a ramjet configuration as part of one such combined cycle propulsion configuration. An investigation was undertaken for a method of turbine-based propulsion which enables the hypersonic vehicle to take off under its own power and propel the aircraft under different mission profiles into ramjet operational Mach regimes. The present study details an optimal method of ramjet exhaust expansion to produce sufficient thrust to propel the vehicle into altitudes and Mach regimes where scramjet operation can be initiated. This aspect includes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-based geometric study to determine the optimal configuration to provide the best thrust values. The CFD parametric analysis investigated three candidate nozzles and indicated that the dual bell nozzle design produced the highest thrust values when compared to other nozzle geometries. The altitude adaptation study also validated the effectiveness of the nozzle thrust at various altitudes without compromising its thrust-producing capabilities. Computational data were validated against published experimental data, which indicated that the computed values correlated well with the experimental data.",Transport aircraft,2018
A time-space synchronized fluid-structure coupling algorithm for the prediction of wing flutter,"A fast dynamic mesh technology by our research group has been applied in the time synchronized fluid-structure coupling. It is found that flow mesh update after the convergent calculation of the flow will induce excessive iterations in the computation of flow increasing the computing time of fluid-structure coupling. To reduce the computing time, a time-space synchronized fluid-structure coupling algorithm was developed in this paper based on the pre-existing time synchronized method and the fast dynamic mesh technology. The wing vibration and flow mesh deformation were computed using the fast dynamic mesh technology after each iteration in the calculation of the flow. Namely, the flow and the wing vibration were solved in space synchronization. The calculating convergence of the flow and the wing vibration were both achieved through iterations every time step. Namely, the flow and the wing vibration were solved in time synchronization. Thus, the flow and the wing vibration are coupled both in time and space synchronization. The flutter boundary of wing 445.6 was predicted using the present algorithm. The calculated results compare well with the experimental data and the computing time was almost reduced by 75%.",Transport aircraft,2018
Analytic study of the conditions required for longitudinal stability of dual-wing aircraft,"Recent studies of new, fuel-efficient transport aircraft have considered designs, which make use of two principal lifting surfaces to provide the required lift as well as trim and static stability. Such designs include open tandem-wings as well as closed joined and box-wings. As a group, these aircraft can be termed dual-wing designs. This study developed a new analytic model, which takes into account the downwash from the two main wings and is sensitive to three important design variables: the relative areas of each wing, the streamwise separation of the wings, and the center of gravity position. This model was used to better understand trends in the dual-wing geometry on the stability, maneuverability, and lift-to-drag ratio of the aircraft. Dual-wing aircraft have been shown to have reduced the induced drag compared to the conventional designs. In addition, further drag reductions can be realized as the horizontal tail can be removed if the dual-wings have sufficient streamwise stagger to provide the moments necessary for trim and longitudinal stability. As both wings in a dual-wing system carry a significant fraction of the total lift, trends in such designs that led to longitudinal stability can differ from those of the conventional aircraft and have not been the subject of detailed investigation. Results from the analytic model showed that the longitudinal stability required either a reduction of the fore wing area or shifting the center of gravity forward from the midpoint of both wings' aerodynamic centers. In addition, for wing configurations of approximately equal fore and aft wing areas, increasing the separation between the two wings decreased the stability of the aircraft. The source of this unusual behavior was the asymmetric distribution of downwash upstream and downstream of the wing. These relationships between dual-wing geometry and stability will provide initial guidance on the conceptual design of dual-wing aircraft and aid in the understanding of the results of more complex studies of such designs, furthering the development of future transport aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2018
A review of recent wake vortex research for increasing airport capacity,"This paper is a brief review of recent wake vortex research as it affects the operational problem of spacing aircraft to increase airport capacity and throughput. The paper addresses the questions of what do we know about wake vortices and what don't we know about wake vortices. The introduction of Heavy jets in the late 1960s stimulated the study of wake vortices for safety reasons and the use of pulsed lidars and the maturity of computational fluid dynamics in the last three decades have led to extensive data collection and analyses which are now resulting in the development and implementation of systems to safely decrease separations in the terminal environment. Although much has been learned about wake vortices and their behavior, there is still more to be learned about the phenomena of aircraft wake vortices.",Transport aircraft,2018
Study of a C-wing configuration for passive drag and load alleviation,"Non-planar wing configurations are often hypothesised as a means for improving the aerodynamic efficiency of large transport aircraft; C-wings may have the ability to exploit and unify drag reduction, aeroelasticity, and dynamics and control but their capacity to do so is ambiguous. The purpose of this work is to provide an experimental demonstration with the aim of verifying the C-wing configurations practical application. Thus, the main objective of this investigation is to quantify the C-wing's ability for drag and load alleviation relative to a planar wing of equivalent wingspan, lift, and root bending moment at Re = 1.5 x 10(6). Surface clay flow visualisations have been used to provide insight into the flow over the wing surface. Aerodynamic performance metrics show that despite the C-wing operating with a 19.1% higher wing wetted area, a peak total drag reduction of 9.5% at alpha = 6 degrees is achieved in addition to a 1.1% reduction in the wing root bending moment for equivalent lift. Force platform measurements in combination with laser vibrometry enabled a detailed understanding of the vibrational characteristics between the model and the wind tunnel. It is shown that the C-wing can passively attenuate buffet induced vibrations of the main-wing by up to 68.6% whilst simultaneously reducing total drag without a significant increase in wing weight or root bending moment.

Parametric Flutter Margin Method for Aeroservoelastic Stability Analysis,"A new parametric flutter margin method for linear and nonlinear stability analysis of aeroservoelastic systems is presented. The method is based on frequency-response calculations with the system stabilized using a single selected structural, aerodynamic, or control parameter, which facilitates convenient response calculations with smooth response variations with respect to the excitation frequency and flight conditions. The frequency-response functions are used for generating flutter margins with respect to the added parameter. The linear flutter or nonlinear limit-cycle oscillation characteristics are those at which the margins become zero. Furthermore, the method facilitates convenient and efficient design studies with respect to linear and nonlinear variations of the selected parameter. A frequency-domain response analysis is first performed with the linear part of the model. Increased-order modeling concepts may then be applied to add nonlinear effects using time-domain convolution or harmonic-balance methods. Three numerical applications are given, one with a classic wing section with flap and two with a generic transport aircraft model. The examples include bending-torsion and control-surface flutter cases, with and without control-system and actuator free-play effects. The results demonstrate excellent agreement with those obtained using traditional flutter methods and nonlinear time-marching simulations.",Transport aircraft,2018
"Extremely deformable morphing leading edge: Optimization, design and structural testing","The future generation of high-lift devices needs to be improved to reduce the noise footprint and increase the performance for takeoff and landing of transport aircraft. To contribute to these goals, an active blown Coand flap-based high-lift system is being investigated within the German national Collaborative Research Center 880 as an alternative to the state-of-the-art flaps. A key part of this system is an adaptive gapless droop nose with extremely large morphing deformation. The design and construction of this component are based on a structural optimization framework. The framework consists of two hierarchical design steps: an optimization of the hybrid composite skin layout with integral T-stringers, acting as joints to the inner actuation mechanism, and the kinematic optimization of the latter. A hybrid skin structure allows a large curvature to rupture in the morphing direction, while providing high stiffness in the transverse direction. This article describes a full-scale hybrid composite morphing droop nose and its structural tests. The results of these tests are finally compared to the finite element simulation and applied for validation of the optimization framework. A sensitivity analysis is provided to evaluate the influence of modelling and manufacturing uncertainties to the shape quality.",Transport aircraft,2018
"Cargo blocking failure analysis, simulation, and safety control of transport aircraft with continuous heavy airdrop","This article investigates the cargo's blocking failure analysis, simulation, and safety control of transport aircraft with continuous heavy airdrop. As the cargos move backward and drop out, the continuous variation of center of gravity for the whole system will deteriorate flight quality dramatically. Furthermore, due to various mechanical reasons, if the cargo is blocked on the delivery channel and the airdrop process is suspended suddenly at this time, the flight safety may be threatened. In view of this, the blocking failure is analyzed based on the aircraft model in this article and then the simulation is completed to show the failure's impact on aircraft's flight quality. Next, based on the uncertainty analysis and introduction of interval robust control theory, the safety controller is designed to stable the closed-loop system. The final simulation shows the proposed safety control strategy's effectiveness.",Transport aircraft,2018
Multi-objective multi-laminate design and optimization of a Carbon Fibre Composite wing torsion box using evolutionary algorithm,"The present study aims to minimize the weight of multi-laminate aerospace structures by a classical Genetic Algorithm (GA) interfaced with a CAE solver. The structural weight minimization is a multi-objective optimization problem subjected to fulfilling of strength and stiffness design requirements as well. The desired fitness function connects the multi-objective design requirements to form a single-objective function by using carefully chosen scaling factors and a weight vector to get a near optimal solution. The scaling factors normalize and the weight vector prioritizes the objective functions. The weight vector selection was based on a posteriori articulation, after obtaining a series of Pareto fronts by 3D hull plot of strength, stiffness and assembly weight data points. During the optimization, the algorithm does an intelligent laminate selection based on static strength and alters the ply orientations and thickness of laminae for faster convergence. The study further brings out the influence of mutation percentage on convergence. The optimization procedure on a transport aircraft wing torsion box has showed 29% weight reduction compared to an initial quasi-isotropic laminated structure and 54% with respect to the metallic structure.",Transport aircraft,2018
Hearing threshold shifts among military pilots of the Israeli Air Force,"Background Military aviators are potentially at risk for developing noise-induced hearing loss. Whether ambient aircraft noise exposure causes hearing deficit beyond the changes attributed to natural ageing is debated. The aim of this research was to assess changes in hearing thresholds of Israeli Air Force (IAF) pilots over 20 years of military service and identify potential risk factors for hearing loss.Methods A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of pure-tone air conduction audiograms of pilots, from their recruitment at 18 years of age until the last documented medical check-up. Mean hearing thresholds were analysed in relation to age, total flight hours and aircraft platform. Comparisons were made to the hearing thresholds of air traffic controllers (ATCs) who were not exposed to the noise generated by aircraft while on duty.Results One hundred and sixty-three pilots were included, with flying platforms ranging from fighter jets (n=54), combat helicopters (n=27), transport helicopters (n=52) and transport aircraft (n=30). These were compared with the results from 17 ATCs. A marked notch in the frequency range of 4-6kHz was demonstrated in the mean audiograms of all platforms pilots, progressing with ageing. Hearing threshold shifts in relation to measurements at recruitment were first noted at the age of 30 years, particularly at 4kHz (mean shift of 2.97dB, p=0.001). There was no statistical association between flying variables and hearing thresholds adjusted for age by logistic regression analysis.Conclusions The audiometric profile of IAF pilots has a pattern compatible with noise exposure, as reflected by characteristic noise notch. However, no flight variable was associated with deterioration of hearing thresholds, and no significant difference from non-flying controls (ATCs) was seen.",Transport aircraft,2018
Pre-design of a commuter transport utilising Voltaic-Joule/Brayton motive power systems,"This investigation surveyed the potential and established outcomes for future 19passenger fixed-wing commuter transport aircraft concepts employing battery-based VoltaicJoule/ Brayton motive power systems with no additional electrical energy drawn from generators mechanically coupled to thermal engines. The morphological approach was that of a tri-prop (two on-wing podded turbo-props and one aft-fuselage mounted electric motor configured as a pusher-on-pylon installation). A Battery System-level Gravimetric Specific Energy (referred to as ""battery energy density"") of at least 500 Wh/kg yielded 39%, 25% and 10% block fuel reductions for 150-nm (Design Service Goal), 430-nm (85th percentile) and 700-nm (maximum range) stage lengths, respectively. All quoted comparisons are against a suitably projected turbo-prop only year-2030 aircraft. In contrast to the reference Beech 1900D, block fuel reductions of up to 44-49% were predicted, which could facilitate a significantly lower deficit in relation to the Advisory Council for Aviation Research and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda (STRIA) 55% target for year 2030. This investigation also indicated that, in the future, suitably flexible hybrid-electric architectures could be fashioned allowing possibility for the aircraft to complete any required city-pair operations (within the legitimate payload-range working capacity) irrespective of exchangeable batteries being available at a given station. Finally, it was also established, assuming such a tri-prop morphology, Normal conducting machines delivering maximum shaft power output of 1.1MW would be required.",Transport aircraft,2018
Effect of actual and accelerated ageing on microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of a 2024-T351 aluminium alloy,"This paper presents an investigation on the effects of ageing on the microstructure and the corresponding physical and mechanical properties of a 2024 aluminium alloy used in a civil transport aircraft wing structure in order to assess the residual resistance of the end of a service life. More precisely, heat treatments are applied in order to simulate thermal ageing actually endured by the structure during service. The results of characterisation of rnicrostructural, physical and mechanical properties are compared not only to the data obtained on a pristine alloy, but also to the results obtained on coupons of a similar alloy coming from the teardown of an A320 aircraft using the same experimental procedure. The main findings are that, during a service life, no significant modification in fatigue resistance is noticed despite of changes in the precipitation structure.",Transport aircraft,2018
Backstepping control based on L-1 adaptive theory for large transport aircraft heavy load airdrop,"A study of the L-1 adaptive controller is conducted based on the backstepping method for the model of large transport aircraft with drastic changes appearing in heavy load airdrop process. The system is divided into an attitude subsystem and a velocity subsystem. For the attitude subsystem, the backstepping control is used to design the virtual control of path angle and the pitch angle in external loop with the L-1 adaptive controller designed in internal loop to estimate the uncertainties and disturbances in the subsystem and to compensate them. In the stability analysis, the uniform boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system is proven. Simulation results show that the proposed control method preserves the quick dynamic torque response, high efficiency, and robustness in heavy load airdrop; to some extent it can alleviate the control switch lead or lag problem and ensure the safety of the transport aircraft to fulfill the complete airdrop mission.",Transport aircraft,2018

Innovative exploration of safe in-flightcrew escape options,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore various in-flight crew escape options of a prototype transport aircraft and finalize the option offering safest crew egress for different combinations of contingencies and flight conditions.Design/methodology/approach Various egress options were explored through simulation in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software using aircraft 3D CAD model and scalable digital mannequins. For this, certain important contingencies which best describe the extreme aircraft behaviour were identified. Crew escape options, which have least external interference in expected egress trajectory, were selected. Several test simulations representing each feasible combination of contingency, escape option and flight condition were simulated. The option which offers safe crew escape in each test case is deemed to be the safest egress option for the test aircraft.Findings Among five options explored, crew escape through forward ventral hatch provided the safest crew escape for all test cases. The selected option was validated for robustness with additional test cases modelling different anthropometric characteristics of 5th and 50th percentile pilot populations with different postures.Originality/value In-flight validation of safe crew escape option is infeasible by actual trial. Exploration of safe crew options for required number of test cases by any analytical method or by wind tunnels tests is tedious, time consuming and extremely expensive. On the other hand, exploration of safest crew option by CFD, besides being first of its kind, provides convenient option to configure, test and validate different test cases with unmatched benefits in time, cost and simplicity.",Transport aircraft,2018

Cooling system of gas turbine engine turbine blades made of heat-resisting alloys and conductive ceramics,"The article deals with thermionic cooling system (TCS) of turbine blades (TB) and other hot elements (HE) of aircraft gas turbine engines (GTD), which consists in coating them with a layer (thermionic-protecting layer (TPL) from heat-proof and heat-resisting material, but with a low electronic work function (EWF). When the TBs and HEs heating, electrons start leaving their surface, taking with them 2-10 MW/m<sup>2</sup> of thermal energy in exponential-like temperature dependence. It will allow increase significantly the GTE efficiency due to the temperature increase of the working gas prior to the turbine and extra thermionic transformation, as well as increase the GTE reliability and lifespan. The thermionic cooling technique under development can be employed in aircraft building while creating power gas turbine installations-converters for the spacecraft of increased power capacity and prolonged active lifespan. It can be implemented also while developing commercial systems of putting a payload and tourists into orbit, including a spacecraft based on the reusable first stage of an aircraft type with GTE, or transport aircraft with thermionic GTE. Besides, the technology under development will be called-up for the fuel-and-power sector and shipbuilding while power plants developing, and in oil and gas sector for gas pumping units developing etc. The TCS realization will allow increase the temperature of the working gas prior to the turbine without increasing the quantity of the air tapped off the compressor, or increase the resource of the most thermally stressed elements of the gas turbine parts, the efficiency increase, thermal stresses reduction in blades due to the thermionic sensitivity to the temperature. It will ensure continuous diagnostics of the turbine state and other high-temperature elements in real-time mode based on electrical engineering parameters, depending on the number of thermo-emission electrons perceived by the anode, and modernize gas turbine installations and GTEs produced in Russia with their resource enhancing due to the extra cooling and without their serious reconstruction.",Transport aircraft,2018
Flight Test Hazard Identification,"Flight tests for aircraft development and certification have higher air accidents risk than other aerospace industries. Accordingly risk identification necessary for risk management in the safety management system is a very important factor in preventing similar air accidents during flight tests. But internationally issued accident statistics are usually confined to commercial transport aircraft and they do not reflect characteristics of flight tests, also databases to hazards identification during flight tests are not established or available in Republic of Korea. Therefore, we identified flight test procedures and traced the major causes of aviation accidents based on the statistics and preventive materials for risk management which were issued by international organizations and advanced countries of aviation. A total of 312 final reports classified as flight test among air accident/incident database held by U.S. NTSB were researched and about 200 flight test hazard were identified. The results of this study will be used as basic data for establishing the safety management system of the national comprehensive flight performance test site.",Transport aircraft,2018
Crash concepts for CFRP transport aircraft-comparison of the traditional bend frame concept versus the developments in a tension absorbers concept,"Due to their inherently brittle behaviour, carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) structures demand for a specific design to achieve appropriate crash energy absorption compared to classical metallic fuselage designs. In this paper, experimental as well as numerical studies on two different crashworthy designs are presented. The first concept aims to absorb the crash energy by crushing of CFRP components below a reinforced cargo cross beam in combination with further energy absorbing devices in the lower side shell. The feasibility of this concept was in the meantime proven by tests at the coupon and structural element level. An alternative crash concept making use of energy absorption in so-called tension absorbers in the passenger and cargo floor structure was developed and assessed with the focus on a reduction of structural mass in combination with improved concept robustness. This paper provides a summary of the performed research work and discusses the context of the concept development. Details on the individual research tasks can be found in further publications which are given in the references.",Transport aircraft,2018
Propagation analysis of variation for fuselage structures in multi-station aircraft assembly,"Purpose - This paper aims to present a modeling and analysis approach for multi-station aircraft assembly to predict assembly variation. The variation accumulated in the assembly process will influence the dimensional accuracy and fatigue life of airframes. However, in digital large aircraft assembly, variation propagation analysis and modeling are still unresolved issues.Design/methodology/approach - Based on an elastic structure model and variation model of multistage assembly in one station, the propagation of key characteristics, assembly reference and measurement errors are introduced. Moreover, the reposition and posture coordination are considered as major aspects. The reposition of assembly objects in a different assembly station is described using transformation and blocking of coefficient matrix in finite element equation. The posture coordination of the objects is described using homogeneous matrix multiplication. Then, the variation propagation model and analysis of large aircraft assembly are established using a discrete system diagram.Findings - This modeling and analysis approach for multi-station aircraft assembly reveals the basic rule of variation propagation between adjacent assembly stations and can be used to predict assembly variation or potential dimension problems at a preliminary assembly phase.Practical implications - The modeling and analysis approaches have been used in a transport aircraft project, and the calculated results were shown to be a good prediction of variation in the actual assembly.Originality/value - Although certain simplifications and assumptions have been imposed, the proposed method provides a better understanding of the multi-station assembly process and creates an analytical foundation for further work on variation control and tolerance optimization.",Transport aircraft,2018
Optimization of Flap Position Using a Modified Discrete-Vortex Method,"The work proposes the use of a low-fidelity discrete-vortex-method-based model for function evaluation in genetic-algorithm-based optimization cycles toward optimizing the flap position of a high-lift configuration. The proposed methodology is a two-step strategy. In the first step, a modified discrete-vortex method is employed to obtain a vortex distribution for a given reference configuration for which the aerodynamic coefficients are known from a high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics solver. A constrained minimization procedure is employed to match the aerodynamic coefficients as computed using the modified discrete-vortex method with those obtained using the high-fidelity solver. The use of drag panels in the modified discrete-vortex method allows drag predictability even though the underlying procedure is based on a potential flow theory. In the second step, the model based on the discrete-vortex method is employed to obtain aerodynamic coefficients for any new configuration that can be considered as a perturbation around a reference configuration. The reference configuration is chosen based on a proximity criterion. The cost effectiveness of the proposed strategy allows the use of multiple optimization cycles, each with a large population size, with the high-fidelity reference data getting enriched at the end of every optimization cycle, particularly in the region of optimality. As the optimization cycles evolve, the model becomes progressively more accurate. The effectiveness of the present optimization strategy is demonstrated for the flap-position optimization of a high-lift airfoil corresponding to a takeoff configuration of a conceptual Regional Transport Aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2017
Enhanced Sensor Monitoring to Maintain Optimal Aircraft Handling in Case of Faults,The design and validation of an advanced fault detection and diagnosis system to monitor the state-of-practice triplex redundant angle of attack measurement is presented. The proposed system fully solves the angle of attack sensor fault isolation problem. It thereby enhances the availability of the full control system functionalities in the case of multiple angle of attack sensor faults and helps to maintain optimal aircraft handling characteristics. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis system relies on advanced model-based and signal-based fault detection techniques. The used null-space-based method for the model-based fault detection filter design is extended to increase the filter robustness to model uncertainties. The developed approaches are applied and validated in realistic flight scenarios using a high-fidelity benchmark model of a large commercial transport aircraft. The reported results indicate that the use of the presented fault detection methods can help to maintain optimal aircraft handling in case of faults.,Transport aircraft,2017
Analysis of the crash of a transport aircraft and assessment of fuzzy-logic stall recovery,"A turboprop transport Flight Data Recorder data indicates that attempt to recover from the stalled conditions has failed, even though the pitch angle is continuously pushed nose-down in accordance with the published stall-recovery technique. The present study is to examine the reasons for the angle of attack being increased in the first place and not being reduced after stall, even though the longitudinal control is set to nose-down. Fuzzy Logic models are used to preserve nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic effects. It is found that the increasing angle of attack is initially caused by the nose-up pitching moment due to inertial coupling. In the subsequent nose-down control attempt for stall recovery, the stall angles of attack are still increasingly higher because the pitch rate relative to the rotating axes stays mostly positive. The present simulation study is based on a new method to be called ""Fuzzy-Logic Dynamic Inversion,"" where desired dynamics with reduced Euler angles and angular rates are specified; while the required control inputs in elevator, aileron and rudder are determined, all through Fuzzy Logic models. Results in elevator, aileron and rudder controls are illustrated to demonstrate the possibility of stall recovery and accident prevention. It is shown that if at the first sign of stall in icing and crosswind flight conditions, and the landing is aborted, stall recovery is possible by applying proper control inputs simultaneously about three control axes to reduce the moments of inertial coupling and the roll and pitch angles.

Numerical Prediction of the Influence of Thrust Reverser on Aeroengine's Aerodynamic Stability,"A numerical method was developed to predict the aerodynamic stability of a high bypass ratio turbofan engine, at the landing stage of a large transport aircraft, when the thrust reverser was deployed. 3D CFD simulation and 2D aeroengine aerodynamic stability analysis code were performed in this work, the former is to achieve distortion coefficient for the analysis of engine stability. The 3D CFD simulation was divided into two steps, the single engine calculation and the integrated aircraft and engine calculation. Results of the CFD simulation show that with the decreasing of relative wind Mach number, the engine inlet will suffer more severe flow distortion. The total pressure and total temperature distortion coefficients at the inlet of the engines were obtained from the results of the numerical simulation. Then an aeroengine aerodynamic stability analysis program was used to quantitatively analyze the aerodynamic stability of the high bypass ratio turbofan engine. The results of the stability analysis show that the engine can work stably, when the reverser flow is re-ingested. But the anti-distortion ability of the booster is weaker than that of the fan and high pressure compressor. It is a weak link of engine stability.",Transport aircraft,2017
Investigation of Engine Oil-cooling Problem during Idle Conditions on Pusher Type Turbo Prop Aircraft,"Aircraft engines need a cooling system to keep the engine oil well within the temperature limits for continuous operation. The aircraft selected for this study is a typical pusher type Light Transport Aircraft (LTA) having twin turbo prop engines mounted at the aft end of the fuselage. Due to the pusher propeller configuration, effective oil cooling is a critical issue, especially during low speed ground operations like engine idling and also in taxiing and initial climb. However, the possibility of utilizing the inflow induced by the propeller for oil cooling is the subject matter of investigation in this work. The oil cooler duct was designed to accommodate the required mass flow, estimated using the oil cooler performance graph. A series of experiments were carried out with and without oil cooler duct attached to the nacelle, in order to investigate the mass flow induced by the propeller and its adequacy to cool the engine oil. Experimental results show that the oil cooler positioned at roughly 25 % of the propeller radius from the nacelle center line leads to adequate cooling, without incorporating additional means. Furthermore, it is suggested to install a NACA scoop to minimize spillage drag by increasing pressure recovery.",Transport aircraft,2017
Using High-Frequency Data for Predicting Fuel Use of Jet Transport Aircraft,"Aircraft fuel models allow operators to predict the amount of fuel an aircraft will consume at a specified flight condition. These models can then be used to generate fuel tables or as standalone predictors for flight planning software to estimate the amount of fuel an aircraft will use during a flight. This Paper proposes four fuel models that are generated based on recent historical high-frequency flight data to predict the fuel use of individual aircraft. Two parametric models are described: a novel dynamics-based parametric model characterized by estimating the aerodynamic and propulsion properties of the aircraft and a simple linear model. Two nonparametric models, a Gaussian process regression model and a k-nearest neighbors regression model, are also described. The models are tested using a set of flight data consisting of flight records from 40 months of time-partitioned training and test sets for each of three individual airframes, each airframe being a different aircraft type, including both narrow- and wide-body jet transport aircraft. The dynamics-based parametric model is demonstrated to consistently improve prediction accuracy for climbing and cruising flight over the existing fuel prediction method.",Transport aircraft,2017
Boundary Layer Ingestion Benefit of the D8 Transport Aircraft,"This paper presents the experimental assessment of the aerodynamic benefit of boundary layer ingestion for an advanced design civil transport aircraft, the D8 double bubble, carried out from 2010 to 2015 as part of a NASA N + 3 Phase 2 Program. A back-to-back comparison of non-boundary layer ingesting and boundary layer ingesting versions of the D8 was conducted using 1:11-scale powered models in the NASA Langley 14- by 22-foot subsonic tunnel. The aerodynamic benefit of boundary layer ingestion, as quantified by the difference in mechanical flow power required with boundary layer ingestion relative to the non-boundary layer ingesting case, was measured using two different methods to be 8.6% at the simulated cruise condition when the same propulsors are used on the two configurations. The benefit is found to be insensitive to the various modeling and processing assumptions. A detailed error analysis shows that the benefit has an uncertainty fraction of 0.21 and a 95% confidence interval fraction of 0.035, thus giving high confidence to these results. This work represents the first measurement of boundary layer ingestion performance improvements for a realistic civil aircraft configuration and provides a proof-of-concept for the use of boundary layer ingestion to improve fuel efficiency of subsonic transports.",Transport aircraft,2017
Aerodynamic Aspects of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Aerial Refueling,"The feasibility of refueling a high-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle was investigated numerically, focusing on the aerodynamic effects. For this study, a single-aisle transport aircraft-based tanker was proposed (the Airbus A320) and, for the much smaller unmanned aerial vehicle, the MQ-9 Reaper was selected (and the weight ratio between these two airplanes was less than 6%). This refueling scenario was different from most previous studies where the tanker and the refueling airplanes were of similar weight. Computed results showed that the aerodynamic coefficients changed significantly with lateral and vertical separation between the two airplanes, and they changed only marginally when changing the following distance. In spite of the size and performance differences, it was found that, when the refueling plane approached from reasonably below and behind the tanker airplane, the induced rolling moments were within the unmanned aerial vehicle aileron control limit and a refueling maneuver was possible.",Transport aircraft,2017
Flight-Test Techniques for Quantifying Pitch Rate and Angle-of-Attack Rate Dependencies,"Three different types of maneuvers were designed to separately quantify the pitch rate and angle-of-attack rate contributions to the nondimensional aerodynamic pitching moment coefficient. These maneuvers combined pilot inputs and automatic multisine excitations, and they were demonstrated with the subscale T-2 and Bat-4 airplanes using the NASA Airborne Subscale Transport Aircraft Research flight-test facility. Stability and control derivatives (in particular, C-mq and C-m alpha) were accurately estimated from the flight-test data. These maneuvers can be performed with many types of aircraft, and the results can be used to improve physical insight into the flight dynamics, facilitate more accurate comparisons with wind-tunnel experiments or numerical investigations, and increase simulation prediction fidelity.",Transport aircraft,2017
Aircraft directional stability and vertical tail design: A review of semi-empirical methods,"Aircraft directional stability and control are related to vertical tail design. The safety, performance, and flight qualities of an aircraft also depend on a correct empennage sizing. Specifically, the vertical tail is responsible for the aircraft yaw stability and control. If these characteristics are not well balanced, the entire aircraft design may fail. Stability and control are often evaluated, especially in the preliminary design phase, with semi-empirical methods, which are based on the results of experimental investigations performed in the past decades, and occasionally are merged with data provided by theoretical assumptions. This paper reviews the standard semi empirical methods usually applied in the estimation of airplane directional stability derivatives in preliminary design, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of these approaches that were developed from wind tunnel tests performed mainly on fighter airplane configurations of the first decades of the past century, and discussing their applicability on current transport aircraft configurations. Recent investigations made by the authors have shown the limit of these methods, proving the existence of aerodynamic interference effects in sideslip conditions which are not adequately considered in classical formulations. The article continues with a concise review of the numerical methods for aerodynamics and their applicability in aircraft design, highlighting how Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solvers are well-suited to attain reliable results in attached flow conditions, with reasonable computational times. From the results of RANS simulations on a modular model of a representative regional turboprop airplane layout, the authors have developed a modem method to evaluate the vertical tail and fuselage contributions to aircraft directional stability. The investigation on the modular model has permitted an effective analysis of the aerodynamic interference effects by moving, changing, and expanding the available airplane components. Wind tunnel tests over a wide range of airplane configurations have been used to validate the numerical approach. The comparison between the proposed method and the standard semi-empirical methods available in literature proves the reliability of the innovative approach, according to the available experimental data collected in the wind tunnel test campaign.",Transport aircraft,2017
Effect of fluid-thermal-structural interactions on the topology optimization of a hypersonic transport aircraft wing,"Aerothermoelasticity plays a vital role in the design of hypersonic aircraft as the coupling between the thermodynamics, aerodynamics and structural dynamics cannot be ignored. While topology optimization has been used in the design of aircraft components, thus far, existing optimization algorithms lack the capability to include aerothermodynamic coupling effects. This article presents an original evolutionary structural topology optimization algorithm that includes hypersonic aerothermoelastic effects. The time-varying temperature distribution is applied through a. conjugate heat transfer analysis integrated in time by an unsteady conduction solver, and is coupled to the aerodynamics, which is calculated by a supersonic vortex lattice method. This article analyses the,effect of fluid thermal-structural interactions on the optimization of a hypersonic transport aircraft wing, by optimizing the wing structure with various degrees of coupling. The coupling of the aerothermodynamics drives the optimization of the structural design and therefore must be considered for hypersonic applications. This new optimization algorithm allows the coupling of the aerothermodynamics to be considered in the early stages of the design, potentially avoiding a costly re-design. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Towards the noise reduction of piezoelectrical-driven synthetic jet actuators,"This work details an experimental investigation aimed at reducing the noise output of piezoelectrical-driven synthetic jet actuators while minimising peak jet velocity reduction. The study considers double-chamber actuator for anti-phase noise suppression and lobed orifice as a method to enhance jet turbulent mixing to suppress jet noise. The study involved the design, manufacture and bench test of interchangeable actuator hardware. Hot-wire anemometry and microphone recordings were employed to acquire velocity and sound pressure level measurements respectively across a range of excitation frequencies for a fixed diaphragm clamping and input voltage. The data analysis indicated a 26% noise reduction (16 dB) from operating a single-chamber, round orifice actuator to a double-chamber, lobed orifice one at the synthetic jet resonant frequency. Results also showed there was a small reduction in peak jet velocity of 7% (similar to 3 m/s) between these two cases based on orifices of the same discharge area. The electrical-to-fluidic power conversion efficiency of the double-chamber actuator was found to be 15% for both orifice types at the resonant frequency; approximately double the efficiency of a single-chamber actuator.

Mathematical Modeling And Numerical Simulation of Dropwise Condensation on an Inclined Circular Tube,"ABSTRACT: Dropwise condensation can improve heat transfer process and, consequently, leads to considerable reduction in size and weight of condensers as well as improvement in the dehumidification process in many applications, especially in civil transport aircraft. It can also be used as an efficient cooling tool for electronics and electrical systems in aircraft engineering and aerospace technology. In this paper, the stable dropwise condensation on an inclined tube is mathematically analyzed. To do this, the population of small droplets is estimated by population balance theory while an empirical correlation is used for large droplets. To calculate heat transfer across each droplet, sum of temperature drops due to droplet curvature, phase change at droplet-vapor interface, conduction through the droplet and promoter layer, are equated with surface subcooling. The total heat transfer is calculated with the given droplets population and heat transfer through single droplet. Subsequently, effects of various parameters, including surface subcooling, contact angle and contact angle hysteresis on the growth rate, maximum radius of droplet, droplets population, and total heat transfer rate, are investigated. Results show that growth rate and heat flux of small droplets are much higher than those of the larger ones; hence, surface with small droplets is preferred for dropwise condensation purposes. Droplets with low contact angle and contact angle hysteresis have higher heat transfer rates. Increasing the inclination of tube improves heat transfer process to such an extent that vertical tubes have higher heat transfer rate than the horizontal ones. This fact indicates that vertical tubes must be used for designing condensers with dropwise condensation, which is quite the opposite for condensers designed based on filmwise condensation.",Transport aircraft,2017
Simulation Study of Severity and Mitigation of Wake-Vortex Encounters in Ground Proximity,"Wake-vortex encounter reports as well as simulations show a significantly higher encounter probability during landing shortly before touchdown in comparison to other flight phases. This is caused, among other factors, by the special behavior of wake vortices in ground effect. Nevertheless, hazardous wake encounters with adverse consequences are rarely reported in reality. To gain more insight in the mechanisms of wake encounters close to ground, encounter simulations were performed with realistic vortex flowfields. These were generated using coupled Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and large-eddy simulations covering the whole vortex evolution in ground effect from generation until decay and were used for a hazard analysis. Encounter simulations were performed with a simulation model of an A320-size aircraft with autopilot engaged following an A340-size aircraft. Different wind conditions and vortex ages were considered as well as a so-called plate line. Recent studies showed increased vortex decay when a series of plates is positioned in front of the runway threshold. The results of the study reveal a significant reduction of the maximal vortex impact on the encountering aircraft due to the plate line. This effect is more pronounced for younger vortices, but also for operationally relevant vortex ages, a considerable effect of the plate lines in reducing the maximum aircraft reaction due to a wake encounter close to ground can be observed.",Transport aircraft,2017
Boundary Layer Ingestion Propulsion Benefit for Transport Aircraft,"This paper presents a description of the physical principles of aerodynamic power savings from boundary layer ingestion propulsion and a quantitative evaluation of the boundary layer ingestion benefit for advanced civil aircraft. Control volume and one-dimensional analyses are used to illustrate two major features of boundary layer ingestion: reduction of jet mixing losses due to decreased jet kinetic energy from reduced velocity of flow entering the propulsor and, to a lesser extent, reduction of airframe wake mixing losses. Embedded boundary layer ingestion propulsion systems can also enable nacelles with reduced surface area and associated weight and drag, further decreasing the aircraft propulsive power requirement. The required propulsor flow power is shown to decrease with increases in both the amount of boundary layer ingested and the propulsor mass flow, and there is thus no unique way to compare boundary layer ingestion and non-boundary-layer-ingestion systems. Using the ideas presented, however, the benefit can be assessed for any given comparison. The analysis is applied to an advanced civil transport aircraft concept with 40% of the fuselage boundary layer ingested, yielding a reduction in required propulsor mechanical power of 9% relative to a non-boundary-layer-ingestion configuration with the same propulsors, in agreement with computational fluid dynamics calculations and wind tunnel experiments.",Transport aircraft,2017
Platform for Transport Aircraft Wing-Body Parametric Modeling and High-Lift System Design,"In this paper, the authors describe a software they have developed for wing-body parametric modeling and high-lift system design. This software has the following features: (1) it generates and modifies geometric as well as aerodynamic analysis in the conceptual and preliminary aircraft design phases; (2) it integrates high-fidelity computer-aided design (CAD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software by a graphical user interface(GUI); and (3) it has an aerodynamic/mechanical integrated design and kinematic simulation for a threedimensional (3D) high-lift device. Based on the application program interface (API) techniques of specialized third-party software, the software integrates B-spline fitting and modeling of airfoil and complex curves, modeling of the fuselage and wings, a high-lift system design, the automatic generation of a structured grid, and high-fidelity CFD code based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. First, the geometry of the fuselage and wing is parametrically generated by lofting with control curves, and then the initial graphics exchange specification (IGES) format geometry is exported to an automatic grid generation module. Finally, the structured grid file is exported to the CFD solver for aerodynamic analysis. The NACA0012 airfoil and DLR-F6 FX2B wing-body model that was published at a workshop are selected for software validation. The cruise configuration model (with nacelle, wingtip, and empennage designed manually) of a 150 seat airliner designed using this software was subsequently used for a high-lift aerodynamic/mechanical integrated design and kinematic simulation. The results illustrate that the software was able to integrate wing-body modeling and high-lift aerodynamic/mechanism design in the conceptual and preliminary aircraft design phases.

Review of hybrid laminar flow control systems,"The aeronautic community always strived for fuel efficient aircraft and presently, the need for ecofriendly aircraft is even more, especially with the tremendous growth of air traffic and growing environmental concerns. Some of the important drivers for such interests include high fuel prices, less emissions requirements, need for more environment friendly aircraft to lessen the global warming effects. Hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) technology is promising and offers possibility to achieve these goals. This technology was researched for decades for its application in transport aircraft, and it has achieved a new level of maturity towards integration and safety and maintenance aspects. This paper aims to give an overview of HLFC systems research and associated flight tests in the past years both in the US and in Europe. The review makes it possible to distinguish between the successful approaches and the less successful or outdated approaches in HLFC research. Furthermore, the technology status shall try to produce first estimations regarding the mass, power consumption and performance of HLFC systems as well as estimations regarding maintenance requirements and possible subsystem definitions.",Transport aircraft,2017
The effect of stiffness and geometric parameters on the nonlinear aeroelastic performance of high aspect ratio wings,"The increase in wing aspect ratio is gaining interest among aircraft designers in conventional and joined-wing configurations due to the higher lift-to-drag ratios and longer ranges. However, current transport aircraft have relatively small aspect ratios due their increased structural stiffness. The more flexible the wing is more prone to higher deflections under the same operating condition, which may result in a geometrical nonlinear behavior. This nonlinear effect can lead to the occurrence of aeroelastic instabilities such as flutter sooner than in an equivalent stiffer wing. In this work, the effect of important stiffness (inertia ratio and torsional stiffness) and geometric (sweep and dihedral angles) design parameters on aeroelastic performance of a rectangular high aspect ratio wing model is assessed. The torsional stiffness was observed to present a higher influence on the flutter speed than the inertia ratio. Here, the decrease of the inertia ratio and the increase of the torsional stiffness results in higher flutter and divergence speeds. With respect to the geometric parameters, it was observed that neither the sweep angle nor the dihedral angle variations caused a substantial influence on the flutter speed, which is mainly supported by the resulting smaller variations in torsion and bending stiffness due to the geometric changes.",Transport aircraft,2017
Performance based multidisciplinary design optimization of morphing aircraft,"The aeronautical industry is currently facing contradictory aircraft design requirements. There is a need to increase speed and capacity while minimizing the environmental impact. Novel configurations and morphing solutions are being proposed to address these requirements. In order to achieve the optimal aircraft configuration or the best morphing solution for a given mission, it is necessary to explore Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO) solutions during the conceptual design phase. To this end, a MDO framework is proposed for conceptual design and analysis of new aircraft configurations, including the capability to analyze and quantify the effect of morphing wing solutions on aircraft performance. To illustrate the versatility and capabilities of the MDO tool, the design of a morphing wingtip on a conventional aircraft for two different flight conditions is assessed based on a reference model transport aircraft. Also, the performance of a morphing bending and twist control applied to a reference joined wing configuration to improve lateral-directional stability is quantified. The results obtained show a significant reduction in fuel consumption when introducing a wingtip, although an incremental and negligible reduction was verified when enabling the wingtip with morphing capabilities. A considerable increase in yaw authority was achieved for the joined-wing model with the bending-twist morphing wingtip, however this morphing concept was not able to reach the same roll authority as conventional ailerons.

Thermal Design of Linear Induction and Synchronous Motors for Electromagnetic Launch of Civil Aircraft,"The engine size of modern passenger transport aircraft is principally determined by take-off conditions, since initial acceleration requires maximum engine power. An electromagnetic launch (EML) system could provide some or all of the energy required at takeoff so that the aircraft engine power requirement and fuel consumption may be significantly reduced. So far, EML for aircraft has been adopted only for military applications to replace steam catapults on the deck of aircraft carriers. This paper will describe the potential application of EML to propel civil aircraft on the runways of modern airports.

Numerical Investigation of Powered High-Lift Model with Externally Blown Flap,"The externally blown flap is an approach of powered-lift technology utilizing conventional pod-mounted engines to blow exhaust over the flap surfaces. Based upon multiblock structured grid techniques and three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational methods, a powered high-lift principle model with externally blown flap is constructed for analysis. Different influencing factors, including engine position, engine-exhaust condition, flap deflection, and flap gap, are investigated in detail to improve powered high-lift effects. Then, flow-control techniques, such as the cove tab and downward deflection of the spoiler, are studied. The cove tab can be helpful for longitude-trim and stability problems, whereas the spoiler downward deflection can help increase lift-to-drag ratios. Both the cove tab and spoiler downward deflection can contribute to the augmentation of the lift coefficients and the elimination of the flow separation over the flap, as well as the reduction of jet-flow spanwise spreading on the leading edge of the lower flap.",Transport aircraft,2017
Improved LQG Method for Active Gust Load Alleviation,"Against a background of various techniques for gust load alleviation (GLA), this paper aims at proposing an improved linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) method, which is robust to variations of flight parameters, structural parameters, and modeling errors and suitable for application in structure/control design optimization. This new technique differs from the traditional LQG methodology by the introduction of properly constructed fictitious high-frequency noise. Furthermore, to accurately measure the stability margins of the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) controllers, a variable-structure mu analysis method is proposed. The parameters of the Dryden continuous gust model are adjusted according to the structural natural frequencies to meet the design requirements, and model reduction combined with input signal scaling is applied to reduce the controller order. Using a general transport aircraft (GTA) model, the robust performance and robust stability of the improved LQG method are compared with those of modern robust controllers, including the H-infinity controller and the mu-synthesis controller. The numerical results demonstrate the successful application of this new technique. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Transport aircraft,2017
Modeling and active disturbance rejection control for sequential airdrop operations,"With the assumption t at the motion acceleration of the cargo is unknown, the dynamic model that accords with the engineering practice of sequential cargo airdrop operations is derived by using the separation body method, which can describe the impact of the sequential moving cargos on the flight safety and airdrop-mission capacity. On this basis, a novel flight control method is designed based on the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) theory. the system is decoupled and linearized through the nonlinear state error feedback; the total unknown disturbances, including unmolded dynamics and uncertainty, are estimated and compensated real-timely by the extended state observer. Moreover, with the consideration of the time-delay system, the ADRC is improved to enhance the accuracy and rapidity of the control system. Simulations are carried out under the condition that one transport aircraft performs sequential airdrop operations. The results verify that the desirable performance and robustness have been achieved and the proposed control method is quite competent for the sequential airdrop operations.",Transport aircraft,2017

Finite-time adaptive sliding mode control for heavyweight airdrop operations,"This paper investigates the problem of designing a fast convergent sliding mode flight controller of a transport aircraft for heavyweight airdrop operations in the presence of bounded uncertainties without the prior knowledge of the bounds. On the basis of feedback linearization of the aircraft-cargo motion system, a novel integral sliding mode flight control law with gains adaptation is proposed. It contains a nominal control law used to achieve finite-time stabilization performance and a compensated control law used to reject the uncertainties. The switching gains of the compensated control law are tuned using adaptation algorithms, and the knowledge of the bounds of the uncertainties is not required to be known in advance. Meanwhile, the severe chattering of the sliding mode control that caused by high switching gains is effectively reduced. The controller and its performance are evaluated on a transport aircraft performing a maximum load airdrop task in a number of simulation scenarios.",Transport aircraft,2017
Motion Simulation of Transport Aircraft in Extended Envelopes: Test Pilot Assessment,"The European research project SUPRA (""Simulation of Upset Recovery in Aviation"") produced an extended aerodynamic model for simulation of a generic transport aircraft, capturing the key aircraft behavior beyond aerodynamic stall. As described in the current paper, a group of 11 test pilots with in-flight experience in stall conditions assessed the validity of this aerodynamic model, in combination with new motion cueing solutions in a conventional hexapod platform as well as a centrifuge-based device. Results showed that the SUPRA model was considered representative outside the normal flight envelope, and on both simulators the enhanced cueing solutions received higher subjective ratings than the comparison condition. The pilots unanimously rejected exercising these conditions without motion. It is concluded that the SUPRA model successfully demonstrates upset conditions, including stall, and that conventional hexapod motion cueing can be improved for the purpose of upset simulation. If available, a ground-based g-device is recommended to provide g-awareness training.",Transport aircraft,2017
Automation Situation Awareness Display for a Flight Envelope Protection System,"This paper presents an interface system display that is conceived to improve pilot situation awareness with respect to a flight envelope protection system, developed for a midsized transport aircraft. The new display is designed to complement existing cockpit displays by augmenting them with information related to both aircraft state and control automation. In particular, the proposed display provides cues about the state of automation directly in terms of pilot control actions, in addition to flight parameters. The paper also presents results of a piloted simulation-based evaluation, which was designed to validate the developed interface by assessing the relevance of the displayed information, as well as the adequacy of the display layout.",Transport aircraft,2017
Backup Controller for Large Transport Aircraft with Insufficient Natural Stability,"For today's commercial airliners, modern fly-by-wire systems provide excellent handling qualities and disturbance rejection capability, which significantly reduce pilot workload during manual flight, thus potentially increasing flight safety. However, in case of severe system failures or unexpected dynamics, many systems immediately degrade to direct mode, where the expected functions and protections degrade or even disappear. This paper assesses whether, with only pitch rate measurable, an emergency longitudinal controller built for a large transport aircraft featuring unstable pitch-up nonlinearities can provide acceptable handling qualities. A requirement-driven, sequential synthesis controller design process is developed, integrating quantitative feedback theory and L-1 piecewise constant output-feedback control theory. The quantitative feedback technique is used to generate a fixed-gain controller to avoid airspeed or dynamic pressure based gain scheduling and provide level 1 handling qualities without existence of the pitch-up nonlinearity. L-1 augmentations are further introduced to eliminate the performance degradation caused by the pitch-up nonlinearity. The fixed-gain controller and the L-1 controllers perform satisfactorily regarding performance and robust metrics within the entire envelope.",Transport aircraft,2017
Adaptive backstepping sliding mode control for heavy-weight airdrop operations,"This paper proposes an adaptive backstepping sliding mode flight control method that is compatible with heavyweight cargo airdrop. The goal is to maintain the plane states during cargo extraction process, in the presence of uncertainties of both constant and time-varying types, as well as matched and unmatched types. A backstepping sliding mode flight control law with parameter adaptation is presented based on the plane-cargo dynamics in strict-feedback form. The control approach consists in having an adaptation law that approximates the disturbance and uncertain aerodynamic function, which is separated from the complex nonlinearities. Also, the adaptation algorithm with projection can bound the estimated function. This ensures the robustness of the controller against time-varying disturbance and uncertainty. The convergence performance and robustness property of the control law are proved by the Lyapunov theory. The control effect is evaluated on a transport plane performing a maximum load airdrop task in a number of simulation scenarios.",Transport aircraft,2017
Adaptive control for a class of uncertain linear parameter-varying flight aircraft systems,"The concept of linear parameter-varying (LPV) model has been developed as a convenient framework to describe a special class of uncertain LPV flight aircraft systems. In this paper, an adaptive control method for a class of uncertain LPV systems whose state-space matrix elements are unknown affine functions of a set of measurable scalar parameters is presented. Firstly, the scalar parameters are separated from the state matrices such that the LPV model is rewritten as general unknown parameter model, then state feedback adaptive control laws, in both cases: the matched uncertainty and the unmatched uncertainty, are designed with the aim of controlling the system state to follow a desired trajectory. The sufficient condition of stability is derived using a Lyapunov equation, not a parameterized Lyapunov equation. Simulation tests based on a simple example and a nonlinear model of a transport aircraft are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control algorithm and to demonstrate that the adaptive controller satisfies the performance requirement for an aircraft control system.

Modeling of CPACS-based fuselage structures using Python,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present some of the key achievements. At DLR, a sophisticated interdisciplinary aircraft design process is being developed, using the CPACS data format (Nagel et al., 2012; Scherer and Kohlgruber, 2016) as a means of exchanging results. Within this process, TRAFUMO (Scherer et al., 2013) (transport aircraft fuselage model), built on ANSYS and the Python programming language, is the current tool for automatic generation and subsequent sizing of global finite element fuselage models. Recently, much effort has gone into improving the tool performance and opening up the modeling chain to further finite element solvers.Design/methodology/approach - Much functionality has been shifted from specific routines in ANSYS to Python, including the automatic creation of global finite element models based on geometric and structural data from CPACS and the conversion of models between different finite element codes. Furthermore, a new method for modeling and interrogating geometries from CPACS using B-spline surfaces has been introduced.Findings - Several new modules have been implemented independently with a well-defined central data format in place for storing and exchanging information, resulting in a highly extensible framework for working with finite element data. The new geometry description proves to be highly efficient while also improving the geometric accuracy.Practical implications - The newly implemented modules provide the groundwork for a new all-Python model generation chain, which is more flexible at significantly improved runtimes. With the analysis being part of a larger multidisciplinary design optimization process, this enables exploration of much larger design spaces within a given timeframe.Originality/value - In the presented paper, key features of the newly developed model generation chain are introduced. They enable the quick generation of global finite element models from CPACS for arbitrary solvers for the first time.",Transport aircraft,2017
Uncertainty Quantification and Certification Prediction of Low-Boom Supersonic Aircraft Configurations,"The primary objective of this work was to develop and demonstrate a process for accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification and certification prediction of low-boom, supersonic, transport aircraft. High-fidelity computational-fluid-dynamics models of multiple low-boom configurations were investigated, including the Lockheed Martin SEEB-ALR body of revolution, the NASA 69 deg delta wing, and the Lockheed Martin 1021-01 configuration. Anonintrusive polynomial chaos surrogate approach was used for reduced computational cost of propagating mixed inherent (aleatory) and epistemic uncertainty through both the computational-fluid-dynamics model and the near-field to ground-level boom propagation model. Amethodology has also been introduced to quantify the plausibility of a design to pass a certification under uncertainty. Results of this study include the analysis of each of the three configurations of interest under inviscid and fully turbulent flow assumptions. A comparison of the uncertainty outputs and sensitivity analyses between the configurations is also given. The results of this study illustrate the flexibility and robustness of the developed framework as a tool for uncertainty quantification and certification prediction of low-boom, supersonic aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2017
Optimization of Commercial Aircraft Using Battery-Based Voltaic-Joule/Brayton Propulsion,"The intent of this investigation was to survey the potential and establish an array of technical targets for future aircraft employing hybrid-electric battery-based voltaic-Joule/Brayton motive power systems with no additional electrical energy drawn from generators mechanically coupled to gas turbines. Irrespective of passenger accommodation (that is, 70 or 180 passengers), it was concluded that the trifan morphology (two underwing podded gas turbines and one aftfuselage-mounted electrically driven motor) would be an appropriate choice. Although a battery cell-level gravimetric specific energy (referredto as ""battery energydensity"") of at least 1300 (W . h ) /kg would be desirable, a less ambitious, yet still aggressive, target of 900-950 (W . h) /kg for battery energy density was found to yield a worthwhile outcome. In terms of effecting a 15% block fuel reduction compared to a suitably projected gas-turbine-only year-2035 aircraft and, in keeping with the aforementioned technical recommendations design range targets of 900 nm (1666 km) and 1100 nm(2037 km) for 70-passenger and 180-passenger aircraft, respectively, were suggested. Finally, it was established assuming the trifan morphology normal conducting machines delivering shaft power output of 4.5 MW for the 70-passenger application and 8.5 MW for the 180-passenger aircraft would be required.",Transport aircraft,2017
Aeroelastic Applications of a Variable-Geometry Raked Wingtip,"This study investigates the effects of a variable-geometry raked wingtip on the aeroelastic behavior and the maneuverability of transport aircraft with very large aspect-ratio truss-braced wings. These truss-braced wing designs are obtained from the multidisciplinary design optimization environment presented here while minimizing the fuel burn of a double-aisle aircraft having a flight mission similar to that of a Boeing 777-200 long-range aircraft. The wingtip can be swept forward and aft relative to the wing by a novel control effector mechanism. Results show that a variable-geometry raked wingtip can be used to achieve required roll control by judiciously sweeping it relative to the wing at various flight conditions. It has an added benefit that it can also be used for flutter avoidance. Such benefits of the variable-geometry raked wingtip allow the operation of truss-braced wing configurations, which have up to 10% lower fuel burn than comparable optimized conventional cantilever wing designs. Without the variable-geometry raked wingtip, such configurations fail to meet the required flutter speed and roll control capability. The variable-geometry raked wingtip is thus an enabling technology for truss-braced wing aircraft and other large aspectratio configurations.",Transport aircraft,2017
IL-76MD-90A aircraft competitiveness recovery,"The paper compares competitiveness of Il-76MD-90§¡ with the US C-17 military transport aircraft. The basic assessment criterion is the aircraft capability to perform landing on unprepared sites with restricted run length, which requires employing the engine thrust reverse. The problems under discussion relate to employing thrust reverser of PS-90A-76 engine, installed on the Il-76MD-90§¡ aircraft. These problems do not only increase the cost of an aircraft operating cycle and affect the flight safety, but reduce its competitiveness as well. The paper presents computation and experimental data, revealing that the main cause of the emerging problems consists in poor external aerodynamics of the power plant during an aircraft ground run employing the thrust reverse. By external aerodynamics the authors mean the gas jet discharge type form the engine reverse units, which may interact with the engine itself and control airframe surfaces while its ground run. Such interaction can lead to: - gas dynamic instability in engine operation; - damages to the rotor blades of the engine caused by foreign objects thrown from the surface of the aerodrome; - Aircraft dynamic characteristics deterioration (wind drag, stability, controllability), and aircraft run-length increase. Unsatisfactory external aerodynamics of the Il-76MD-90A aircraft is the cause of its poor competitiveness compared to the US military transport aircraft S-17. Ways to the aircraft external aerodynamics improvement are considered below: - the engine reversal thrust value optimization; - reverse jets discharge optimization in accordance with the aircraft layout. Ways of the Il-76MD-90A aircraft external aerodynamics improvement were developed based on estimated and full-scale studies. The substantiation of the developed measures is based on the design features analysis of the S-17 engine reverser unit. From the above said the author concludes: 1. The level of Il-76MD-90A aircraft power plant external aerodynamics is not high enough. 2. The Il-76MD-90A airplane competitiveness recovery requires carrying out studies on the power plant external aerodynamics improvement, which will allow competition with the S-17 aircraft in the foreign market.",Transport aircraft,2017
Adaptive design of experiments for efficient and accurate estimation of aerodynamic loads,"Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to document an efficient and accurate approach to generate aerodynamic tables using computational fluid dynamics. This is demonstrated in the context of a concept transport aircraft model.Design/methodology/approach -Two designs of experiment algorithms in combination with surrogate modelling are investigated. An adaptive algorithm is compared to an industry-standard algorithm used as a benchmark. Numerical experiments are obtained solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a large computational grid.Findings -This study demonstrates that a surrogate model built upon an adaptive design of experiments strategy achieves a higher prediction capability than that built upon a traditional strategy. This is quantified in terms of the sum of the squared error between the surrogate model predictions and the computational fluid dynamics results. The error metric is reduced by about one order of magnitude compared to the traditional approach.Practical implications -This work lays the ground to obtain more realistic aerodynamic predictions earlier in the aircraft design process at manageable costs, improving the design solution and reducing risks. This may be equally applied in the analysis of other complex and non-linear engineering phenomena.Originality/value -This work explores the potential benefits of an adaptive design of experiment algorithm within a prototype working environment, whereby the maximum number of experiments is limited and a large parameter space is investigated.",Transport aircraft,2017
Disturbance Observer-Based Dynamic Surface Control of Transport Aircraft With Continuous Heavy Cargo Airdrop,"This paper investigates the dynamic surface control of nonlinear transport aircraft model during the process of continuous heavy cargo airdrop in case of disturbance and actuator saturation. For the continuous airdrop process, the effects of moving process parameters include cargo mass and moving items upon the flight and the aircraft dynamics is with dramatic change. The dynamic surface related technique is designed for the attitude subsystem with unmatched disturbance and unknown dynamics so that in each step the virtual control is carefully considered using disturbance observer while the auxiliary signal is constructed in case of actuator saturation. The closed-loop stability is established via Lyapunov approach. In simulation test, it is interesting to find out that continuous airdrop process will deteriorate the system stability if additional control effort is not exerted. The proposed disturbance observer-based control can effectively enhance the reliability and robustness of the system, and can make sure of the smooth system performance at the instant of the heavy cargo separating from the aircraft.",Transport aircraft,2017
Numerical Study of Aerothermodynamic Characteristics of the Supersonic Airliner Prototype in Cruising Flight Mode,"Results of theoretical and computational study of supersonic flow around complex three-dimensional model of high-speed civil transport aircraft are presented. The Reaction Engines' LAPCAT A2 (Long-Term Advanced Propulsion Concepts And Technologies) airliner designed under the project of the same name is chosen as the virtual prototype. The computations are conducted using the software package for numerical simulation of aerothermodynamics and aerophysics of arbitrary high-speed aircraft configurations developed in Institute for Problems in Mechanics Russian Academy of Sciences (IPMech RAS).

The Application of the Human Model in the Thermal Comfort Assessment of,"Thermal comfort is an important content concerned by aircraft designing and using department. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a main numerical simulation method used in this field. A human model of a pilot is built according to its geometrical and thermal features in order to simulate the air flow and heat transfer in a fighter plane's cockpit. The velocity and temperature fields are obtained by using a numerical simulation flat involving the human model above. Meanwhile, an experiment was carried out to prove the effectiveness of numerical simulation. The comparison between calculation results and experiment results shows that the calculation error of velocity and temperature is 15% and 6% respectively, which proves that the human model can be used for numerical simulation and satisfy the requirement of simulation precision. Furthermore, some thermal comfort assessment criteria such as the mean skin temperature and the core temperature of the body are obtained by putting calculation result above into the Human Thermal Regulation System (HTRS) model.",Fighter,2011
Numerical Simulation and Experimental Study on Air Flow and Heat,"Thermal comfort is an important content of the airworthiness and Computational Fluid Dynamics(CFD) is a main numerical simulation method used in this field.

Based on these two models, an air velocity and temperature numerical simulation flat of the cockpit is established and an experiment is carried out to prove the effectiveness of the simulation flat. The comparison between calculation result and experiment result shows that the flat can indicate the unevenness and the asymmetry of the heat transfer through walls and the air flux and temperature out of air supply holes on air distribution system. The calculation error of velocity and temperature is 15% and 6% respectively, which proves that the flat has rather high precision and engineering value.",Fighter,2009

Morphological filter based noise removal from vibration signals of,"This paper solves the pretreatment problem of the vibration signal of a certain fighter plane's engine. The engine's vibration signal is mainly affected by noise of the plane's subsystems and the power supply instrument on the ground. The basic frequency of the vibration signal is a little smaller than the frequency of the disturbing signal when the engine operates in the throttling state, the maximum state and the accelerating state, so the traditional linear filter such as low-pass filter cannot remove the disturbing signal well. In this paper, we introduce the mixed nonlinear morphological filter with the moving average filter to remove the noise. This method is compared with the moving average filter and the median filter, test results show that the proposed algorithm can remove the noise with less distortion.",Fighter,2001
The Effects of Visual Complexity and Decluttering Methods on Visual Search and Target Detection in Cockpit Displays,"Efficient visual search and accurate target detection are crucial during flight operations. Despite the continuous effort to improve cockpit displays, visual complexity remains to be a problem that affects pilots' search and detection performance. This has become more evident with the integration of high fidelity and information loaded cockpit displays of the fifth-generation fighter aircraft. One known but often overlooked solution to mitigate the problem with visual complexity is by decluttering. This study aims to provide an objective definition of visual complexity in cockpit displays and investigate its effects on visual search time and target detection accuracy. Moreover, it also aims to compare the visual search and target detection performance across different decluttering methods. Lastly, it intends to propose threat-based criteria for decluttering information in cockpit displays. The present study is divided into three sections, each addressing one of the three main objectives of this research. In study 1, visual search time and target detection accuracy were compared across three conditions that consist of displays with varying levels of visual complexity (low, medium and high). Visual complexity is operationally defined as the combination of different features (color, shape and orientation) and its variations (e.g., color: red, green, white). In study 2, differences in visual search time and target detection accuracy across four decluttering methods (dimming, dotting, small sizing and removal) and between groups (pilot and non-pilot) were analyzed. In study 3, through AHP analysis a threat scoring equation was proposed and tested. The results of the first study suggest that increased visual complexity leads to an increase in visual search time and more target detection errors. On the other hand, findings from the latter study revealed that there is a significant difference in the visual search time and target detection accuracy between different decluttering methods. Moreover, group differences were found when the threat scoring equation was applied to the targets. The results of the present study could provide inferences on how to alleviate the adverse effects of visual complexity through the utilization of effective decluttering methods, which in turn could further improve pilots' overall performance.",Fighter,2021
"The effects of 12 weeks of functional strength training on muscle strength, volume and activity upon exposure to elevated G(z) forces in high-performance aircraft personnel","Background Technological advancements in modern military and acrobatic jet planes have resulted in extraordinary psychophysiological loads being exerted upon flying personnel, including inducing neck and back pain. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 12 weeks of functional strength training on 1) the volume and strength of the neck and shoulder muscles and 2) muscular activity upon exposure to helmets of different masses and elevated G(z) forces in a long-arm centrifuge in high-performance aircraft personnel. Methods Eighteen participants underwent 12 weeks of functional strength training (n = 12) or the control protocol (n = 6) without additional strength training. Pre- and post-intervention tests included evaluations of isometric strength of the head extensor muscles, flexion, and lateral flexion and rotation, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the volume of the m. sternocleidomastoideus, m. trapezius, and deep neck muscles. Furthermore, during a long-arm centrifuge (+ 1.4 and + 3 G(z)) protocol, the muscular activity levels of the m. sternocleidomastoideus, m. trapezius and m. erector spinae muscles were assessed without a flight helmet, with a helmet, and with a helmet and night vision goggles. Each participant's perception of muscular strain was noted immediately after the long-arm centrifuge protocol. Results The maximal isometric strength in all exercises and muscle volumes increased in the training group but not the control group (P < 0.05). Relative muscle activity (%MVC) with a helmet decreased after the intervention in the training but not the control group (P = 0.01). Relative muscle activity while wearing a helmet and night vision goggles was higher after intervention in the control group than in the training group (P < 0.01). The perceived muscular strain of the neck muscles induced by the long-arm centrifuge did not differ between the groups. Conclusion Twelve weeks of functional strength training improves the maximal isometric strength and volume of neck and shoulder muscles and leads to lower relative muscle activation upon exposure to elevated G(z) forces in a long-arm centrifuge.",Fighter,2021
Strengthening parliamentary oversight of defence procurement: lessons from Belgium,"This paper asks: to what extent can a dedicated or special committee with access to classified information empower parliaments to oversee major defence procurement decisions? These decisions often involve a mixture of political, military, economic and societal interests. Particularly after episodes of contestation or controversy, questions tend to arise about how to empower parliaments. The central argument in this paper is that being institutionally empowered and incentivised does not guarantee rigorous oversight. The availability of expertise is an oft-ignored factor in studies of parliamentary oversight. An analysis of oversight behaviour by the Belgian Federal Parliament during the acquisition of new fighter jets (2015-2018) shows that members of parliament also need to be capable of mobilising the necessary expertise in order to translate technical information in such a way that it allows them to influence decision-making, which is often executive-dominated. In this way, this paper contributes to managing expectations about the capacity of parliaments to cope with complex military problems.",Fighter,2021

Flight simulation is a multidisciplinary subject that relies on several research disciplines which have a tendency to be investigated separately and in parallel with each other. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the research within the FSTD domain with a motivation to highlight contributions from separate research topics from a general aspect, which is necessary as FSTD is a complex man-machine system. Application areas of FSTD usage are addressed, and the terminology used in the literature is discussed. Identification, classification, and overview of major research fields in the FSTD domain are presented. Specific characteristics of FSTD for fighter aircraft are discussed separately.",Fighter,2021
Fear and Pride Among Fighter Pilots: Combat Emotions During a Bombing Campaign,"This article analyzes the combat emotions of Royal Norwegian Air Force Fighter pilots (hereafter RNoAF) during their bombing campaign over Libya in 2011. Using grounded theory in our interviews with them, we identified 12 categories of their emotions and behaviors, with variations in pride and fear emerging as the two key themes. We show how those two emotions thread through the literature of emotions in combat, and show further how our data, and the resulting matrix from an analysis of it, both apply to and extend that literature. We also show how the high and low variations of pride and fear interact to both support and counter each other. Our findings thus make an important contribution to the combat emotions literature on the action and behavior of fighter pilots.",Fighter,2021

What motives do they give for doing so, how are they treated by the police and journalists after they return from the wars in Syria and Iraq, and do they express other motives than those given by Westerners who have joined IS?",Fighter,2021
India's Foreign Fighter Puzzle,"Since its rise in 2014, Islamic State (IS) has attracted more than 30,000 volunteers to take part in the conflicts raging in Syria and Iraq. Despite a large presence of more than 160 million Muslims in India, not more than a hundred people have travelled abroad to join IS. This article attempts to explain the low participation of Indian Muslims in foreign conflicts. Drawing on existing literature and interviews with academics, government officials and members of the Muslim community across India, this article demonstrates that insurgency movements such as the Afghan Jihad in the 1980s, Indian government actions, and other factors such as logistical issues, family structure, ideological opposition and racism in IS ranks have collectively played a role in preventing Indians from taking part in the Syrian and Iraqi conflicts. This article is valuable given the low level of literature pertaining to Indian Muslims and their absence from the global jihadist community.",Fighter,2021
Prediction Model of Working Hours of Cooling Turbine of Jet Engine with Back-propagation Neural Network,"It is critical to maintain jet fighter aircraft so that they are in the best flying condition. Among the various components of aircraft, the environmental control system is crucial as it provides cool air for the cabin and electronic equipment. In this study, we develop a model that predicts the remaining working hours of the critical components of aircraft using a back-propagation neural network (BPNN). First, we adopted the Delphi method with repeated questionnaire surveys to select six key components in the environmental control system, where the cooling turbine was considered the most important component for the prediction model. Then, with the same method, four of the key parameters for the cooling turbine were selected to establish the prediction model. Actual maintenance data from 2009 to 2013 were used for training the neural network to produce the smallest errors between the actual working hours according to inspection results and the predicted working hours. This verification result showed that the correlation and the goodness of fit were above 0.984 and 0.963, respectively, and the prediction accuracy was 93%. These results indicate that the prediction model with the BPNN can be effectively used to predict the remaining working hours of the cooling turbine. The model can reduce the cost of maintenance and the time lost from the disassembly of components and the halting of flights, as well as unnecessary wear and tear.",Fighter,2021
Hyperoxic Effects on Decompression Strain During Alternating High and Moderate Altitude Exposures.,"INTRODUCTION: In fighter aircraft, long-duration high-altitude sorties are typically interrupted by refueling excursions to lower altitude. In normoxia, excursions to moderate cabin altitude may increase the occurrence of venous gas emboli (VGE) at high cabin altitude. The aim was to investigate the effect of hyperoxia on VGE and decompression sickness (DCS) during alternating high and moderate altitude exposure.METHODS: In an altitude chamber, 13 healthy men were exposed to three different conditions: A) 90 min at 24,000 ft (7315 m) breathing normoxic gas (54% O?; H-NOR); B) 90 min at 24,000 ft breathing hyperoxic gas (90% O?; H-HYP); and C) three 30-min exposures to 24,000 ft interspersed by two 30-min exposures to 18,000 ft (5486 m) breathing 90% O? (ALT-HYP). VGE occurrence was evaluated from cardiac ultrasound imaging. DCS symptoms were rated using a scale.RESULTS: DCS occurred in all conditions and altogether in 6 of the 39 exposures. The prevalence of VGE was similar in H-NOR and H-HYP throughout the exposures. During the initial 30 min at 24,000 ft, the prevalence of VGE was similar in ALT-HYP as in the other two conditions, whereas, after the first excursion to 18,000 ft, the VGE score was lower in ALT-HYP than in H-NOR and H-HYP.DISCUSSION: Hyperoxic excursions from 24,000 to 18,000 ft reduces VGE occurrence, presumably by facilitating diffusive gas exchange across the bubble surfaces, increasing the share of bubble content contributed by oxygen. Still, the excursions did not abolish the DCS risk.Anell R, Gronkvist M, Gennser M, Eiken O. Hyperoxic effects on decompression strain during alternating high and moderate altitude exposures.

Numerical Virtual Flight Simulation of Quasi-Cobra Maneuver of a Fighter Aircraft,"By using a computational-fluid-dynamics-based numerical virtual flight (NVF) simulator, a simplified quasi-Cobra maneuver of a typical third-generation fighter is simulated and the unsteady aerodynamics, such as the dynamic forces and moments and the flow separation, are analyzed preliminarily. The NVF simulator integrates an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver on dynamic unstructured/hybrid grids, a rigid-body dynamics solver, and user-defined flight control system. To analyze the complex multiphysics coupling problem, four cases with increasing complexity are studied, including 1) static state simulation; 2) one-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) forced pitchup; 3) 1-DOF pitchup by open-loop control of the elevators; and 4) three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) quasi-Cobra maneuvering. By applying a cosine function open-loop flight control law to the elevators and introducing a simplified vector thrust model, the fighter can pitch up to a high angle of attack from the cruising state, and then it can pitch down quickly, the whole process is similar to a Cobra maneuver. Even though theRANSsimulations are not necessarily highly accurate for the large angle of attack, the multidisciplinary application in this work demonstrates the potential of the NVF simulator for the simulations of realistic poststall maneuvers.",Fighter,2021
Verbal Reports' Influence on Pilot Flight Performance and Mental Stress Under Spatial Disorientation,"BACKGROUND: Circumstances in flight can adversely affect a pilot's spatial abilities and lead to spatial disorientation (SD), increasing the potential for fatal accidents. To systematically understand the impact of SD, it is important to quantitatively and qualitatively analyze pilots'flight performance and mental stress, and to verify the effectiveness of verbal reports (VR) in enabling pilots to deal with an SD situation. This study investigated the effects of VR execution and type of SD on flight performance and mental stress.METHODS: SD simulation experiments were conducted on 30 Air Force fighter pilots (15 in the VR group and 15 in the non-VR group) with electrocardiography (ECG) sensors attached.The pilots gave their VRs by immediately verbalizing their attention to instrument information and six potentially disorientating scenarios were implemented in each flight phase. Flight performance was analyzed using instructor evaluation and self-evaluation scores, and mental stress was measured using heart rate variability (HRV) and perceived distress score.RESULTS: In maintaining flight performance, the VR group, respectively, had 8% and 10% higher scores for altitude and speed than the non-VR group. The self-evaluation scores were lowest for Coriolis, while Graveyard Spin was scored lowest in the instructor evaluations. Regarding mental stress, the VR group tended to have higher HFs and lower LF/HF ratios among HRV measures than the non-VR group, and an 11% lower perceived distress score.The highest perceived distress score was for Coriolis.DISCUSSION: We suggest that pilots can be assisted to understand and overcome SD situations through VR.",Fighter,2020
Muscular Fitness Improves during the First Year of Academy Studies among Fighter Pilot Cadets,"Background: An adequate level of muscular fitness is related to occupational performance in military personnel, including pilots flying high performance aircraft. The aim of this study was to describe the baseline level and the change in muscular fitness between the first and the second years of the Air Force Academy among fighter pilot cadets. Methods: The muscular strength and endurance test results of 182 male fighter pilot cadets were analyzed during their first year in the Air Force Academy and one year after. Maximal isometric strength tests included trunk flexion, trunk extension and bilateral leg extension tests, whereas muscle endurance was measured with modified a sit-up test and seated alternative dumbbell press. Results: The maximal isometric bilateral strength of the leg extensor muscles increased from 220 +/- 42 to 232 +/- 42 kg. The maximal isometric trunk extension strength increased from 117 +/- 21 to 120 +/- 19 kg and trunk flexion from 82 +/- 16 to 86 +/- 17 kg. Muscle endurance increased from 68 +/- 13 to 75 +/- 15 repetitions/min in seated dumbbell press and from 47 +/- 12 to 51 +/- 13 repetitions/min in sit-up test. Conclusions: Both maximal strength and muscular endurance improved among fighter pilot cadets, which indicates that occupational performance is well maintained or improved from the perspective of physical fitness during the early phase of academy studies. Education in the Air Force Academy, including physical education, seems beneficial in improving muscular fitness among military pilots.",Fighter,2020
Low-complexity framework for GNSS jamming and spoofing detection on moving platforms,"Performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) mounted on aerial platforms could be degraded by the presence of jamming or spoofing threats. Detection of jamming and spoofing is essential considering practical applications of satellite navigation in passenger aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters and fighters. Different algorithms and methods have been proposed for detection of these threats; however, their usage has many limitations because of their demanding weight, size and computational complexity, when embedded on aerial systems. In this study, the authors develop a theoretical framework to detect the presence of the threat of UAVs. The idea is based on the fact that, due to the UAV motion, the samples of received signal power from a fixed threat and from a GNSS satellite have different empirical probability density functions. Moreover, by using two antennas (an omnidirectional and a down-tilted-directional), they introduce a new method to distinguish between aerial and ground-based threats. The proposed algorithms have a low-computational burden and can consider the fading loss as well. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed methods, in terms of detection and false alarm probability, compared to the existing methods.",Fighter,2020
Aviation-Associated Spatial Disorientation and Incidence of Visual Illusions Survey in Military Pilots,"ObjectiveThe lack of information on active military pilots has led to the present study, which aimed to analyze the sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation and the incidence of visual illusions of fighter and transport military pilots through a post-flight survey. Background: The advance of aeronautics has led to further aircraft developments, increasing heights and speeds which increase the psychophysiological demands, thus leading to greater incidence of spatial disorientation and visual illusions.Methods60 male pilots with large professional experience (1012 h +/- 250 accumulated flying hours) between 7 and 18 years in their respective units and experience in international missions in the current conflict areas as Lebanon, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, were subjected to a post-flight visual experience questionnaire.ResultsOur findings suggest that transport pilots tend to present significant higher disorientation situations than fighter pilots, while fighter pilots presented greater sense of aviation-associated spatial disorientation but experimented more visual illusions.ConclusionThese differences are related with the demands of the different aircrafts used by each pilot, thus specific, individualized and larger simulated training sessions in simulated environments are suggested. Further research should focus on the analysis of peripheral and central fatigue as constructs that may help to the appearance of greater spatial disorientation and visual illusions.",Fighter,2021
Normobaric hypoxia training in military aviation and subsequent hypoxia symptom recognition,"Altitude hypoxia episodes are increasingly common in military aviation. Hypoxia training is mandatory for fighter pilots, but evidence-based data on the effects of training are scarce. The purpose of this study was to validate the normobaric hypoxia (NH) training effect. Data were collected from 89 pilots from the Finnish Air Force (FINAF). This survey was conducted in a tactical F/A-18C Hornet simulator in two sessions under normobaric conditions, in which the pilots performed flight missions and breathed 21% oxygen (O-2) in nitrogen (N-2), and blinded to the pilot, the breathing gas was changed to a hypoxic mixture containing either 8, 7 or 6% O-2 in N-2. The time taken to notice hypoxia symptoms and peripheral capillary O-2 saturation was measured. A mean of 2.4 years after the initial training, pilots recognised their hypoxic symptoms 18 s quicker with 8% O-2 mixture, 20 s quicker with 7% O-2 and 10 s quicker with 6% O-2. Our data indicate that NH training in a flight simulator helps pilots to recognise hypoxia symptoms earlier, and may, thus, enhance flight safety.Practitioner Summary: We show that hypoxia training enhances pilots' ability to recognise symptoms of acute normobaric hypoxic exposure up to 2.4 years after an initial NH training session. Based on these data, refreshment NH training is nowadays mandatory every 3 years in the FINAF as opposed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Standardisation Agreement (STANAG) requirement of 5-year intervals between hypoxia trainings.",Fighter,2021
Roles of Physiological Responses and Anthropometric Factors on the Gravitational Force Tolerance for Occupational Hypergravity Exposure,"Gravity in the head-to-toe direction, known as +Gz (G force), forces blood to pool in the lower body. Fighter pilots experience decreases in blood pressure when exposed to hypergravity in flight. Human centrifuge has been used to examine the G tolerance and anti-G straining maneuver (AGSM) techniques of military pilots. Some factors that may affect G tolerance have been reported but are still debated. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses and anthropometric factors correlated with G tolerance. We retrospectively reviewed the training records of student pilots who underwent high G training. Variables were collected to examine their correlations with the outcome of 7.5G sustained for 15 s (7.5G profile). There were 873 trainees who underwent 7.5G profile training, 44 trainees (5.04%) could not sustain the test for 15 s. The group with a small heart rate (HR) increase (less than 10%) during the first 1-5 s of the 7.5G profile had a nearly ten-fold higher failing chance compared with the large HR increase group (adjusted odds ratio: 9.91; 95% confidence interval: 4.11-23.88). The chances of failure were inversely related to the HR increase percentage (p for trend <0.001). Factors, including body mass index, relaxed and straining G tolerance, and AGSM, were found to be negatively correlated with the outcome.",Fighter,2020
Utilisation of Ram Air Turbine on a Fighter Platform for Energy Extraction : Failure Mode Study,Aircraft electrical system needs to be robust enough to cater for electrical power requirements of all the systems of the aircraft and all the safety/degraded mission critical systems in failure modes. Designing such a robust electrical system for a developmental aircraft program is a challenge. A developmental aircraft during its various phases would involve integration of additional systems and new weapons (in case of fighter aircraft). Integration of newer systems imposes fresh challenges in managing the electrical system architecture especially in failure modes. Weapon integration in a prototype fighter program is dynamic as newer contemporary weapons are developed at faster pace and ever evolving. Power crisis through existing on-board power generation systems in failure mode was felt during an indigenous aircraft development program. A novel idea of introducing a Ram Air Turbine and utilize the power generated during main alternator failure for critical systems was studied. The intention of this paper is to cover the details of the study carried out towards utlisation of such a Ram Air Turbine in landing phase for extraction of energy in case of main alternator failure.,Fighter,2020
When Ali Comes Marching Home: Shi'a Foreign Fighters after Syria,"Since the Syrian Civil War broke out in 2011, there has been an unprecedented mobilization of Iran-backed Shi'a foreign fighters to Syria to protect Shi'a communities and shrines, combat the Islamic State, and buttress Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. As the conflict nears a resolution, the fate of these Shi'a fighters remains uncertain. This article argues large numbers of Shi'a foreign fighters will engage in domestic and transnational insurgency and civil war due to hardening sectarian identities, a nascent pan-Shi'a ideology, Iranian direction, and the presence on ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and South Asia; however, the threat is lessened by so-called off-ramps, ranging from death to disillusionment with conflict. The article concludes with implications and policy recommendations for U.S. leaders.",Fighter,2020
Lone Soldiers in the Israeli Military - A Research Note on the Conceptualization of Foreign Fighters,"This research note contributes to the growing body of knowledge on foreign fighters in international affairs. While most scholars in the field derive their understanding of the phenomenon from highly publicized cases of Western Muslims fighting alongside Jihadi groups in the Middle East, this article brings a new case study into the arena: Jewish foreign nationals who voluntarily enlist in the Israeli military, also known as lone soldiers. After a presentation of this to date unexplored case (i.a. through nineteen semi-structured interviews), the article delves into the conceptual realm, discussing whether Israel's lone soldiers can be analyzed within the foreign-fighter framework in the first place. Based on the empirical findings and an interdisciplinary literature review on foreign fighters the article argues that lone soldiers do constitute a relevant case study. This research note further suggests that much of the controversy on conceptual matters could be avoided by understanding the phenomenon as an action (i.e., foreign fighting) rather than an actor (i.e., foreign fighter). Further research is warranted to support these findings.",Fighter,2020
Maximizing the microwave absorption performance of polypyrrole by data-driven discovery,"Microwave-absorbing materials (MAMs) have played critical roles in many civil and military applications, such as coating materials on stealth fighters to avoid radar detections. The efficacy of MAMs is evaluated with the reflection loss (RL) and the bandwidth (Delta f(10), which refers to the band where >= 90% microwave irradiation is lost), along with the peak's position (f(max)) and the thickness of the coating. Large RL and Delta f(10) are frequency targeted for optimized performance. In this study, we demonstrate a data-driven discovery approach to reveal the maximized RL and Delta f(10), using a polypyrmle/paraffin composite as an example, and found that record-setting RL of -62.6 dB and Delta f(10) of 7.7 GHz, are obtained, as the best values that have been reported for polypyrrole. We believe that this data-driven approach can be widely applied to other composite systems, to allow more exciting discoveries in the future.",Fighter,2020
Self-Kinematic Training for Flight-Associated Neck Pain: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Flight-associated neck pain (FANP) is a serious problem in fighter pilots. Despite the high impact of FANP there is little evidence for effective management. However, self-kinematic training showed a positive effect in the general population. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a self-kinematic training program using virtual reality in improving neck pain in fighter pilots.METHODS: There were 45 pilots with FANP who were randomized to a control group (N = 23) or a training group (N = 22). Training participants were instructed to exercise using a personalized self-training program, for 20 min/wk, for 4 wk. Primary outcome measures were neck disability (NDI%) and mean velocity (degrees . s(-1)), and secondary were pain, health status, accuracy, and isometric strength. Assessments were conducted by a blinded assessor and intention-to-treat analysis by a blinded statistician.RESULTS: There were 40 pilots who completed the postintervention assessments, and 35 completed the 6-mo follow-up. Baseline measurements showed mild pain and disability (mean VAS = 43 +/- 22.73, NDI = 17.76 +/- 9.59%) and high kinematic performance. Compliance with self-training was poor. No differences were observed in self-reported measures and strength. Exercise duration was correlated with NDI% improvement.DISCUSSION: This self-kinematic training promoted kinematic performance, but was ineffective in engaging the pilots to exercise, and consequently did not improve pain and disability. Poor compliance was previously reported in self-training for FANP, suggesting further studies should prioritize supervised training. Considering the high baseline kinematic performance, kinematics does not seem to be a key factor in FANP, and future exercise research should aim for intense strengthening to increase endurance to the high G(z) pilots experience.",Fighter,2020
Rotating wire brush ocular trauma in a fighter pilot,"Penetrating ocular injuries from rotating wire brush is a previously underreported still preventable risk of ocular trauma which poses serious threats for vision. We describe a case of an injury caused by rotational wire brush to a pilot of a high-performance fighter plane, with an excellent visual outcome, and a fully restored vision and functionality status. Despite the unpropitious expected visual outcome due to the severity of the trauma, proper management can restore the vision. This is the first case, reporting this type of injury, with a fully restored vision to maintain flying status in a high performance and demanding military environment.",Fighter,2020
A Puncher's chance: Expected gain and risk taking in a market for superstars,"Do policies that decrease potential earnings at the top of the income distribution induce agents to alter their risk taking behavior? To answer this question I collect data on Mixed Martial Arts pomotions. I exploit the fact that one promotion introduced such a policy, while its competitor did not. Using a standard Difference-in-Differences analysis, I find that fighters in the promotion that implemented the policy take significantly less risks after its inception. On top of being statistically significant, the effect is also economically significant: the decrease in frequency of risk-taking ranges from 10% to 26% in the treatment group.",Fighter,2020
"Malignancy in US Air Force fighter pilots and other officers, 1986-2017: A retrospective cohort study","Objective This study sought to determine the incidence rates of cancer, overall and by site, among active component U.S. Air Force fighter pilots, and to compare the rates with those in other active component Air Force officers. Methods Using a matched retrospective cohort design, U.S. Air Force fighter pilots were compared with other commissioned officers who entered active component service between 1 January 1986 and 31 December 2006. The cohort was followed for cancer diagnoses in TRICARE and the Veterans Health Administration from 1 October 1995 through 31 December 2017. Fighter pilots and non-fighter pilot officers were compared after matching on sex, age at first observation (15 age groups), and age at last observation (15 age groups). Sex-stratified overall and site-specific cancer rates were compared with matched Poisson regression to determine incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results During 1,412,590 person-years of follow-up, among the study population of 88,432 service members (4,949 fighter pilots and 83,483 matched officers), 977 incident cancer cases were diagnosed (86 in fighter pilots and 891 in matched officers). Male fighter pilots and matched officers had similar rates of all malignant cancers (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: 0.83-1.31) and of each cancer site. Female fighter pilots and matched officers also had similar rates of all malignant cancers (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.25-4.04). Discussion In the active component U.S. Air Force, fighter pilots and their officer peers had similar overall and site-specific cancer rates.",Fighter,2020
Development of Flight Control Law for Improvement of Uncommanded Lateral Motion of the Fighter Aircraft,"The Abrupt Wing Stall (AWS) at moderate Angle-of-Attacks (AoA) and transonic flight conditions can result in uncommanded lateral motions such as heavy wing, wing drop and wing rock that degrade handling qualities, mission performance and safety of flight for the aircraft. This phenomenon caused by asymmetric wing flows makes it difficult to perform precision tracking or maneuvering in the transonic flight envelope. According to the previous research results, this substantial phenomenon has occurred in a large number of the fighter aircraft programs, typically at the early flight test development stage, and a lot of budgets and efforts are required through the development period of the aircraft. To compensate for this drawback, Free-To-Roll (FTR) wind tunnel test is adopted as a method to identify the uncommanded lateral motions of the aircraft and improve the flight characteristics at the configuration design stage. However, using only the existing control methods such as the feed-forward control methods as well as the configuration design can reduce limitedly the uncommanded lateral motion. Besides, the feedback control methods using optimal control, adaptive and neural network control which do not provide a deterministic solution are limited to obtain the airworthiness certification. This paper presents a new design approach in which uncommanded lateral motions of the aircraft can be reduced even more than the existing methods. That is the additional augmentation control method, using angular acceleration measurement, that improves the flight characteristics using a feedback control technique based on the Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI). To evaluate the performances of the proposed control method, we perform the frequency-domain linear analysis and time-domain numerical simulations based on the mathematical model of advanced trainer aircraft. The evaluation result reveals that the proposed control method reduces effectively uncommanded lateral motions and improves the handling qualities of the aircraft.",Fighter,2020
Acquiring Ventilators: Fighter Planes without High-octane Fuel and Pilots: Indian Perspective in COVID Era.,"During this coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, all the countries are emphasizing on procurement of more and more sophisticated machineries for the intensive care unit (ICU) like ventilators. But do all countries have to follow the same? The requirements are different for low- and middle-income countries like India, which are resource limited. The ventilators require oxygen supply and manpower to function which are deficient in these countries. These countries might do well only by procurement of oxygen delivery machinery, as most of the patients of COVID require oxygen only. Only approx. Five percent of COVID-19 patients require ventilators. Moreover, the patients on ventilators have high mortality. Thus, low-resource countries need to redefine their priority as to how to utilize their resources. This manuscript emphasizes the need for the same.How to cite this article: Aggarwal R, Trikha A.

Maneuver Strategy Generation of UCAV for within Visual Range Air Combat Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Target Position Prediction,"With the development of unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI), within visual range (WVR) air combat confrontations utilizing intelligent UCAVs are expected to be widely used in future air combats. As controlling highly dynamic and uncertain WVR air combats from the ground stations of the UCAV is not feasible, it is necessary to develop an algorithm that can generate highly intelligent air combat strategies in order to enable UCAV to independently complete air combat missions. In this paper, a 1-vs.-1 WVR air combat strategy generation algorithm is proposed using the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). A 1-vs.-1 WVR air combat is modeled as a two-player zero-sum Markov game (ZSMG). A method for predicting the position of the target is introduced into the model in order to enable the UCAV to predict the target's actions and position. Moreover, to ensure that the UCAV is not limited by the constraints of the basic fighter maneuver (BFM) library, the action space is considered to be a continuous one. At the same time, a potential-based reward shaping method is proposed in order to improve the efficiency of the air combat strategy generation algorithm. Finally, the efficiency of the air combat strategy generation algorithm and the intelligence level of the resulting strategy is verified through simulation experiments. The results show that an air combat strategy using target position prediction is superior to the one that does not use target position prediction.",Fighter,2020
An Autonomous Attack Guidance Method with High Aiming Precision for UCAV Based on Adaptive Fuzzy Control under Model Predictive Control Framework,"With its superior performance, the unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) will gradually become an important combat force in the future beyond-visual-range (BVR) air combat. For the problem of UCAV using the BVR air-to-air missile (AAM) to intercept the highly maneuvering aerial target, an autonomous attack guidance method with high aiming precision is proposed. In BVR air combat, the best launching conditions can be formed through the attack guidance and aiming of fighters, which can give full play to the combat effectiveness of BVR AAMs to the greatest extent. The mode of manned fighters aiming by manual control of pilots is inefficient and obviously not suitable for the autonomous UCAV. Existing attack guidance control methods have some defects such as low precision, poor timeliness, and too much reliance on manual experience when intercepting highly maneuvering targets. To address this problem, aiming error angle is calculated based on the motion model of UCAV and the aiming model of BVR attack fire control in this study, then target motion prediction information is introduced based on the designed model predictive control (MPC) framework, and the adaptive fuzzy guidance controller is designed to generate control variable. To reduce the predicted aiming error angle, the algorithm iteratively optimizes and updates the actual guidance control variable online. The simulation results show that the proposed method is very effective for solving the autonomous attack guidance problem, which has the characteristics of adaptivity, high timeliness, and high aiming precision.",Fighter,2020

In our research setting, the copycat product has a high resemblance to the luxury brand manufacturer's original product, so customers may purchase the copycat product to gain the status utility. We find that the manufacturer should launch a fighter brand if the copycat product has a low resemblance to the original product. Moreover, the copycat will be less likely to enter the market when the manufacturer releases a fighter brand. Some insights regarding consumer surplus and social welfare are also provided.",Fighter,2020
A review and historical development of analytical techniques to predict aircraft spin and recovery characteristics,"Purpose This paper aims to present a literature review on analytical research on the prediction of aircraft spin and recovery characteristics, as it progressed from the early years of aviation to current state of the art spin technologies.

Development of a control law to improve the handling qualities for short-range air-to-air combat maneuvers,"Modern fighter aircraft have been designed to have high maneuverability in order to preoccupy strategic superiority in short-range air-to-air combat between fighter aircraft in warfare. Digital fly-by-wire flight control system design is aimed at providing good handling qualities for all mission task elements over the entire flight envelope. To provide both excellent gross acquisition and fine tracking compatibility, simultaneously for air-to-air combat maneuvers, this article presents a common longitudinal control law design of a task-dependent self-adjusting command-path pilot prefilter gain scheduler within the same control law design architecture and response type based on nonlinear dynamic inversion control. We perform the frequency- and time-domain analyses based on the mathematical model of T-50 advanced trainer aircraft to evaluate the basic flying qualities of the proposed control method. Furthermore, the pilot evaluation is performed to evaluate the gross acquisition and fine tracking capability for air-to-air tracking maneuvers in a handling quality simulator. The evaluation results reveal that the proposed control method improves the fine tracking capability without the degradation of gross acquisition.",Fighter,2020

SecRIP: Secure and reliable intercluster routing protocol for efficient data transmission in flying ad hoc networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) come up with eminent opportunities for military and civilian applications. Such opportunities come with unique challenges. The high mobility of UAVs leads to the frequent change in the network topology that results in packet loss or routing path failure, and so on. Moreover, secure routing is one of the most important features while organizing wireless communication among UAVs. To counter these challenges, a secure and reliable routing protocol (SecRIP) for the flying ad hoc network is proposed for efficient and reliable data transfer. This SecRIP works toward the enhancement of the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) metrics. The SecRIP works on two algorithms: (i) a chaotic algae algorithm and (ii) dragonfly algorithm; these algorithm serves the functionality of cluster selection, management, and data transmission in intercluster. The proposed technique is compared with other existing techniques using a network simulator. The results show that the proposed technique is capable of maintaining the higher QoS and the QoE standards and also helps the nodes conserve their power without compromising on the performance. The simulated results show improvement as it decreases the delay incurred in SecRIP is 24%, and routing overhead is 19%, where the PDR of SecRIP is increased by 32% in comparison with existing protocols. In an extreme case, when node density increases, the SecRIP helps to limits the delay to 41%, and the PDR is 28% higher than the other existing protocols. Finally, the result demonstrates that the SecRIP protocol achieves secure and reliable data transmission.",Drone,2020
Guarding a Territory Against an Intelligent Intruder: Strategy Design and Experimental Verification,"This article designs and tests a dominant region based strategy for a group of defenders to intercept an intruder before it enters a target area. The intruder is intelligent in the sense that it makes decisions based on the defenders' strategies instead of following a predefined path, making the problem a differential game. When the intruder moves slower than the defenders, the optimal strategies are solved from a geometric concept called the dominant region. These strategies are then extended into the case where the intruder travels faster. Crazyflie 2.1 is used as an experimental platform to test the proposed strategy. For fixed defender locations, a barrier line can be found such that the intruder is guaranteed to be captured outside the target area if it starts beyond.",Drone,2020

"Drones, Warfare and the Deconstruction of the Enemy","Abstract Based on the theoretical frameworks of Carl Schmitt (hostis and inimicus), Giorgio Agamben (field and homo sacer), and Gr¨¦goire Chamayou (hunter-states and kill boxes), and being seen through the theoretical lens of post-structuralism in International Relations, this article aims to analyse the use of drones, especially Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs), in the ¡®War on Terror¡¯ led by the USA. In this context, we seek to demonstrate how the use of drones has affected the logic of current warfare scenarios in three different, but related aspects. First of all (Act One), the use of drones makes the construction of political otherness of the enemy impossible, and thus identity construction by counterpoint impracticable. Then (Act Two), this paper demonstrates how there is an attempt to move the enemy to the externality of the International Community, relegating their status to banishment and marginalisation. Finally (Act Three), the authors analyse the role of kill boxes and how the solution given by this phenomenon subverts the traditional notions of sovereignty, challenging the very raison d¡¯¨ºtre of politics.",Drone,2020
Detection and Classification of Multirotor Drones in Radar Sensor Networks: A Review,"Thanks to recent technological advances, a new generation of low-cost, small, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is available. Small UAVs, often called drones, are enabling unprecedented applications but, at the same time, new threats are arising linked to their possible misuse (e.g., drug smuggling, terrorist attacks, espionage). In this paper, the main challenges related to the problem of drone identification are discussed, which include detection, possible verification, and classification. An overview of the most relevant technologies is provided, which in modern surveillance systems are composed into a network of spatially-distributed sensors to ensure full coverage of the monitored area. More specifically, the main focus is on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensor, which is a key technology also due to its low cost and capability to work at relatively long distances, as well as strong robustness to illumination and weather conditions. This paper provides a review of the existing literature on the most promising approaches adopted in the different phases of the identification process, i.e., detection of the possible presence of drones, target verification, and classification.",Drone,2020
Detection of global positioning system spoofing attack on unmanned aerial vehicle system,"Most of the existing global positioning system (GPS) spoofing detection schemes are vulnerable to the generative GPS spoofing attack, or require additional auxiliary equipment and extensive signal processing capabilities, leading to defects such as low real-time performance and large communication overhead which are not available for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, also known as drone) system. Therefore, we propose a novel solution which employs information fusion based on the GPS receiver and inertial measurement unit. We use a real-time model of tracking and calculating to derive the current position of the drones which are then contrasted with the position information received by the receiver to verify whether the presence or absence of spoofing attack. Subsequent experimental work shows that, the proposed method can accurately detect the spoof within 8 seconds, with a detection rate (DR) of 98.6%. Compared with the existing schemes, the performance of real-time detecting is improved while the DR is ensured. Even in our worst-case, we detect the spoof within 28 seconds after the UAV system starts its mission.",Drone,2020
The war against vague threats: The redefinitions of imminent threat and anticipatory use of force,"This article explores how the United States (US) has redefined the concept of 'imminent threat' in order to relax the rules for anticipatory use of armed force against insurgents. The article focuses on how two new definitions of imminent threat have changed the conduct of specific combat activities, namely, drone strikes and ground combat operations. The central part of the article is divided into four sections. The first section examines the redefinition of imminent threat in the context of drone warfare, while the second section provides an analysis of the redefinition of imminent threat in ground combat operations. Both sections show how the new definitions of imminent threat abandoned two key elements of the classic definition, that is, the immediacy and certainty of the threat. The third and fourth sections of the article explore how the new definitions of imminent threat prevented the application of two key principles governing the use of armed force: the principles of necessity and proportionality. Both sections show how successive US administrations enabled the US military to conduct operations without observing these two key principles regulating the use of force.",Drone,2021
Multi-Perspective Object Detection for Remote Criminal Analysis Using Drones,"When a crime is committed, the associated site must be preserved and reviewed by a criminal expert. Some tools are commonly used to ensure the total registration of the crime scene with a minimal human interference. As a novel tool, we propose, here, an intelligent system that remotely recognizes and localizes objects considered as important evidences at a crime scene. Starting from a general viewpoint of the scene, a drone system defines trajectories through which the aerial vehicle performs a detailed search to record evidences. A multi-perspective detection approach is introduced by analyzing several images of the same object in order to improve the reliability of the object recognition. To the best of authors' knowledge, it is the first work on remote autonomous sensing of crime scenes. Experiments demonstrated an accuracy increase of 18.2% points, when using multi-perspective detection.",Drone,2020
El desarrollo tecnol¨®gico en materia policial: una receta de ¨¦xito para la prevenci¨®n del delito,"Abstract: Latin America is one of the most violent regions in the world and, therefore, its police forces face great challenges to reduce, control, and prevent crime and violent acts. However, in recent years, technological innovation has supported countries such as Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay in this task. Integrated information systems, big data analysis, geographic information systems, facial recognition cameras, integrated command centers, drones, among others, are some of the technology and artificial intelligence developments that police bodies have used to improve police action in crime prevention.

Drone Launched Short Range Rockets,"A concept of drone launched short range rockets (DLSRR) is presented. A drone or an aircraft rises DLSRR to a release altitude of up to 20 km. At the release altitude, the drone or an aircraft is moving at a velocity of up to 700 m/s and a steep angle of up to 68 degrees to the horizontal. After DLSRRs are released, their motors start firing. DLSRRs use slow burning motors to gain altitude and velocity. At the apogee of their flight, DLSRRs release projectiles which fly to the target and strike it at high impact velocity. The projectiles reach a target at ranges of up to 442 km and impact velocities up to 1.88 km/s. We show that a rocket launched at high altitude and high initial velocity does not need expensive thermal protection to survive ascent. Delivery of munitions to target by DLSRRs should be much less expensive than delivery by a conventional rocket. Even though delivery of munitions by bomber aircraft is even less expensive, a bomber needs to fly close to the target, while a DLSRR carrier releases the rockets from a distance of at least 200 km from the target. All parameters of DLSRRs, and their trajectories are calculated based on theoretical (mechanical and thermodynamical) analysis and on several MatLab programs.",Drone,2020
How (not) to stop the killer robots: A comparative analysis of humanitarian disarmament campaign strategies,"Whether and how Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) can and should be regulated is intensely debated among governments, scholars, and campaigning activists. This article argues that the strategy of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to obtain a legally binding instrument to regulate LAWS within the framework of the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons is not likely to be effective, as it is modeled after previous humanitarian disarmament successes and not tailored to the specifics of the issue. This assessment is based on a systematic comparison of the autonomous weapons case with the cases of blinding laser weapons and anti-personnel landmines that makes use of an analytical framework consisting of issue-related, actor-related, and institution-related campaign strategy components. Considering the differences between these three cases, the authors recommend that the LAWS campaign strategy be adjusted in terms of institutional choices, substance, and regulatory design.",Drone,2021
UAVs for the Benefit of People: The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Within the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission,"This article explores the adoption of drones by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE's) Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) to Ukraine, a first time for the organization, to overcome the impediments imposed by the sides to its monitoring of the security situation in Eastern Ukraine. This article begins by tracing back the origin of the SMM drone program and the challenges posed by jamming, shooting, and the presence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) belonging to conflicting parties. This article then highlights the contributions made in direct benefit to the residents of the conflict-affected regions, mainly providing critical information for the repair works conducted along the line of contact and by increasing awareness of the security risks nearby entry-exit checkpoints and civilian buildings. The article concludes that a more systematic and coordinated sharing of drones' images with specific international partners, complements the work of SMM monitors and allows the humanitarian responders to perform a more effective needs assessment and advocacy work.",Drone,2020
Perception of drone related risks in Czech society,"The article examines perception of drone connected risks and the approval of the various purposes of the drone technology employment (rescue, traffic, security, private etc.) in Czech Republic and the opinion differences between drone users and non-users. Familiarity hypothesis, implying lower risk expectation and higher approval in the group of users, is tested in an online panel survey, concluding that user experience influences risk perception by broadening the scope of perceived possible events and contributes to the ability to evaluate risks. Further, five scenarios of precepted possible events are identified as espionage/spying, business rivalries, ideological attack, blackmailing, unintentional accident. The approval of individual modes of use is then found to be divided into two groups pattern unlimited use and the use for public good. This division does not correspond with the users, non-users group.",Drone,2020
Artificial Intelligence Fights Crime and Terrorism at a New Level,"High expansion of urban population and infrastructure complemented by recent geopolitical world events, triggered an increasingly alarming number of threats. Law enforcement authorities are now challenged to redesign societal security concepts. Although current technological advances eased the information access, e.g., via video surveillance cameras, satellite data, drones, wearables, manual analysis of such big and diverse data to extract strategic knowledge is not a solution anymore. There is the critical need for automatic solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the breakthrough of deep neural networks opened a new perspective for providing such solutions with a human-grade accuracy. Here, we provide a snapshot of our AI research for counter terrorism on automatic person and object identification, retrieval of speech intelligence, and dissimulated behavior analysis. The research was carried out during the UEFISCDI SPIA-VA research project at CAMPUS Research Center, University ""Politehnica"" of Bucharest, with the participation of UTI Grup and of the Military Equipment and Technologies Research Agency (ACTTM), having as public beneficiary the Protection Guard Service, Romania (SPP).",Drone,2020
A Lightweight and Low-Power UAV-Borne Ground Penetrating Radar Design for Landmine Detection,"This paper presents the development of a lightweight and low-power Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to detect buried landmines in harsh terrain, using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Despite the fact that GPR airborne systems have been already used for a while, there has yet been no focus on the UAV autonomy, which depends on the payload itself. Therefore, the contribution of this work is the introduction of a lightweight and low-power consumption GPR system, which is based on the Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave (SFCW) radar principle. The Radio Frequency (RF) transceiver represents an improved implementation of the super-heterodyne architecture, which currently offers higher sensitivity. This is achieved by combining analog and digital processing techniques. The experimental results showed that the developed system can detect both metallic and plastic buried targets. Target detection with a scanning height up to about 0.5 m shows good applicability in an unstructured, harsh environment, which is typical of mined terrain. The proposed system still needs some improvements for a fully operational system regarding different aspects of scanning speeds and soil properties such as moisture content.",Drone,2020
A secure authentication scheme framework for mobile-sinks used in the Internet of Drones applications,"Within the last decade, communication technologies have evolved rapidly, and this caused significant advancements for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, has attracted the interest of researches because of their fundamental attributes such as mobility, flexibility, reliability and energy efficiency in wireless networks. Similar to wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and other remote sensing applications, these devices are generally not designed with integrated security mechanisms. Furthermore, the existing solutions in which the main focus is on drone communication security are quite limited in the literature. Since the UAVs have the potential to handle very sensitive data, the exchange of information over wireless channels can cause serious exposures. The authentication schemes to be employed should be handled with care because of the limited resources and energy available with the sensor nodes. The existing enabling UAV technologies have restricted authentication privileges for their interaction with WSNs. In this paper, UAVs which can act like mobile-sinks are considered and existing work on WSN-UAV environment authentication is extended. A secure authentication framework using elliptic-curve crypto-systems is presented. The proposed framework is evaluated to ensure it is resilient to significant well-known potential attacks related with data confidentiality, mutual authentication, password guessing, and key impersonation.",Drone,2020
Tightly coupled aeroelastic model implementation dedicated to fast aeroelastic tailoring optimisation of high aspect ratio composite wing,"This paper presents the development of a code, called GEBTAero, dedicated to very flexible aircraft (VFA) aeroelasticity and especially the evaluation of aeroelastic tailoring effect on critical speeds. GEBTAero is an open source code consisting in a tightly coupling between a geometrically exact beam theory -and a finite state induced flow unsteady aerodynamic model, including an homogenisation tool. This model has been implemented in Fortran using GEBT code and optimised open source libraries with particular focus on computation speed. Besides a non linear transient dynamic simulation capacity, a particular focus is put on the fast critical speed computation strategy using a non-iterative modal approach about the geometrically non linear deformed shape of the wing with the computation of only a few aeroelastic modes. Computation speed and accuracy of this implementation is assessed using widely used aeroelastic test cases and compared successfully to other aeroelastic codes. Configurations using aeroelastic tailoring, which are the core target of this solver, are then evaluated numerically on a representative high aspect ratio anisotropic composite wing and a simple 2-ply composite laminates with both variable ply orientations. It illustrates the strong correlation between the structural bending/twisting coupling of an unbalanced composite laminates and its critical aeroelastic speed. It also shows the high sensitivity of ply orientation on the aeroelastic behaviour. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Relax and Recover: Guaranteed Range-Only Continuous Localization,"Range-only localization has applications as diverse as underwater navigation, drone tracking and indoor localization. While the theoretical foundations of lateration-range-only localization for static points-are well understood, there is a lack of understanding when it comes to localizing a moving device. As most interesting applications in robotics involve moving objects, we study the theory of trajectory recovery. This problem has received a lot of attention; however, state-of-the-art methods are of a probabilistic or heuristic nature and not well suited for guaranteeing trajectory recovery. In this letter, we pose trajectory recovery as a quadratic problem and show that we can relax it to a linear form, which admits a closed-form solution. We provide necessary and sufficient recovery conditions and in particular show that trajectory recovery can be guaranteed when the number of measurements is proportional to the trajectory complexity. Finally, we apply our reconstruction algorithm to simulated and real-world data.",Drone,2020
Exploitation of multipath micro-Doppler signatures for drone classification,"In this study, the authors present a method of fusion of direct-path and multipath micro-Doppler radar signatures to improve the accuracy of micro-drone classification in urban environments. By using a high-resolution radar, the direct-path and multipath echoes are separated based on the indices of the range cells they occupy. The time-frequency spectrograms of the drones are obtained by performing the short-time Fourier transform on the direct-path and multipath echoes, respectively. The direct-path and multipath features, which are extracted by the principal components analysis on the direct-path and multipath spectrograms, respectively, are fused and fed into classifiers to determine the type of drones. Experimental results based on measured data demonstrate that the classification accuracy produced by multipath exploitation is 5% higher than that obtained by using the direct-path echo only.",Drone,2020
DopplerNet: a convolutional neural network for recognising targets in real scenarios using a persistent range-Doppler radar,"In the past few years, the commercial use of drones has exploded, since they are a safe and cost-effective solution for many kinds of problems. However, this fact also opens the door for malicious use. This work presents a novel system able to detect and recognise drones from other targets, allowing the police and security agencies to deal with this new aerial thread. The proposed system only uses a persistent range-Doppler radar, avoiding the restrictions of the optical sensors, usually required for the recognition part. The processing is based on constant false alarm rate detection stage, followed by a convolutional neural network that performs the recognition. This network takes as input raw range-Doppler radar data and predicts their class (car, person, or drone). For this purpose, an extensive controlled trial test campaign has been performed, resulting in a novel dataset with more than 17,000 samples of drones, cars, and people, acquired in real outdoor scenarios. As far as authors' knowledge, this is the first range-Doppler radar database for the recognition of drones and other targets. The high-accuracy results (99.48%) suggest that this system could be successfully used in security and defence applications to discriminate between drones and other entities.",Drone,2020
Reward-driven U-Net training for obstacle avoidance drone,"Along with the fast progress in deep learning, an autonomous drone with obstacle avoidance capability has been studied mainly by two machine learning paradigms, Le. supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. The former has some advantages since the trained network is light and fast, but it needs a large amount of data that requires laborious manual labeling. With the latter, such a drawback can be overcome as an agent learns by itself in a simulated environment, although the gap between the real and simulated one has to be minimized in the end. This study proposes a new framework where a supervised segmentation network is trained with labels made by an actor-critic network in a reward-driven manner, wherein this U-Net based network infers the next moving direction from the sequence of input images. For the actor-critic part, several recent policy gradient algorithms have been tested for controlling the drone with the continuous action space. After training in the Airsim simulation environment, the model is transferred to a Bebop drone flying in the real environment, built as a reconfigurable maze using panels and a hoop. The result suggests that our network enables the drone to navigate through the obstacles using only monocular RGB input in the trained environment as well as in the reconfigured ones without retraining.

Online Trajectory Generation With Distributed Model Predictive Control for Multi-Robot Motion Planning,"We present a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm to generate trajectories in real-time for multiple robots. We adopted the on-demand collision avoidance method presented in previous work to efficiently compute non-colliding trajectories in transition tasks. An event-triggered replanning strategy is proposed to account for disturbances. Our simulation results show that the proposed collision avoidance method can reduce, on average, around 50 of the travel time required to complete a multi-agent point-to-point transition when compared to the well-studied Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC) approach. Additionally, it shows a higher success rate in transition tasks with a high density of agents, with more than 90 success rate with 30 palm-sized quadrotor agents in a 18$\text{m}<^>3$ arena. The approach was experimentally validated with a swarm of up to 20 drones flying in close proximity.",Drone,2020
A lightweight authentication and key agreement scheme for Internet of Drones,"Drones in Internet of Drones (IoD) can be able to reconnoiter environment, transport the commodity with the help of embedded various sensors. They have been widely used in various fields and brought a great convenience to the production and life. But data collected by sensors embedded in drones are facing new security challenges and privacy issues with the technology update over time. For the sake of ensuring the security of transmitted data, many authentication and key agreement (AKA) schemes have been proposed in the past. Nevertheless, most of schemes are subjected to serious security risks and have high communication and computation cost. To address these issues in IoD, we propose a lightweight AKA scheme in which there are only secure one-way hash function and bitewise XOR operations when drones and users mutually authenticate each other. The proposed scheme can achieve AKA-security under the random oracle model and withstand various known attacks. Meanwhile, the security comparison demonstrates our proposed scheme provides better security. In terms of communication and computation cost, our proposed scheme has better functionality features than the other two schemes.",Drone,2020
Cooperative comodule discovery for swarm-intelligent drone arrays,"This study presents a method for discovering comodules from a drone array. Herein, a comodule represents a frequent connection pattern among drones and their connected targets (e.g., mobile phones and end users) - Frequent connections among drone-to-drone (D2D) and drone-to-target (D2T) patterns. In the Internet of Drones (IoD), where sensing and communications become a major task, it is important to explore the cooperative components (i.e., subgraphs or comodules) of the network because data streams frequently flow through those components. Once a comodule is found, the control center can notify the drones along with their connected targets to process data in a cooperative mode. However, it is difficult to extract comodules since the topology of the IoD is fluid. Additionally, the targets connected to the IoD could be dynamic and mobile. To effectively discover comodules while considering mobile targets at the same time, this study proposes regularized self-organizing sparse network factorization. It jointly decomposes a connection network formed by a drone array and its connected targets into basis and coefficient matrices. Comodules can be explored by examining those matrices. Experiments were carried out on open Call Data Records and a drone array. The results show that the proposed method generated less divergence and higher tightness between the nodes of a comodule than the baseline did.",Drone,2020
An energy-aware drone trajectory planning scheme for terrestrial sensors localization,"Employing GPS-equipped drones to act as mobile anchors is a popular solution for terrestrial sensors positioning in a generic environment. Researchers have proposed several approaches, usually to reduce estimated locations error and increase localization coverage, though no efficient solution has been presented for energy conservation of the drone. Drones, such as the commercial quadcopters, have limited power supply and cannot fly long. Any localization algorithm should consider the energy constraints beside the performance indicators. Furthermore, there is no suggested strategy to mitigate the error of Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based distance measurements in the existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to plan the drone trajectory, called the ""Weighted Energy-aware Trajectory with Adaptive Radius (WETAR)"". The proposed scheme employs Linear Programming (LP) for trajectory planning in the presence of the sensors with given estimative regions which are acquired in a range-free pre-localization phase. It also specifies candidate waypoints, which are the projection of aerial anchor points on the ground, and assign weights to them based on two criteria: quality of the beacons that the sensors would receive and their coverage ratio. We assume that sensors utilize a range-based localization algorithm on the basis of RSS measurements. Simulation results show that the WETAR as an aerial anchor guiding mechanism, guides the drone effectively and reduces localization time, saves the drone energy, and improves the location error as well as the localization coverage.",Drone,2020
Network for hypersonic UCAV swarms,"Unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) that swarm with both autonomous decision-making and cooperative attacking have been regarded as revolutionary elements of modern warfare. In such a swarm, inter-group connectivity must be ensured in a network to maintain a collective consensus. In recent years, academia and industry have made many efforts to achieve common tactical data link systems and commercial drone networks. However, the existing results have difficulty meeting the needs of cooperative autonomous UCAV swarms with both hypersonic mobility and time sensitivity in severe confrontation scenarios. In this article, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the network used for the hypersonic UCAV swarms, which can be considered as a special form of mobile wireless network. Furthermore, faced with specific functional demands, we summarize the main challenges of designing this dedicated network. In addition, a comprehensive survey of potential solutions for the network design is presented. Lastly, we discuss the possible capabilities of the network given the current forefront of technology, as well as remaining challenges and open issues.",Drone,2020
Perpetrating and resisting fortress USA: documentary strategies of National Bird and Fahrenheit 11/9,"This article analyzes two documentary films that figure the enmeshment of individuals and institutions in attitudes and practices of 'fortress USA' and studies the role of media in facilitating and resisting that process. Whereas a large share of the scholarly literature on trauma and documentary has focused for good reason on the atrocities of Hitler's Holocaust, the Cambodian Genocide, and the Rwandan Genocide, and on the testimonies of survivors, the documentary films under study here present certain actions by the United States as perpetrative: that is to say, as rife with casualties and as racist, media-dependent, and insupportable from the perspective of social justice. National Bird features whistleblowers of the U.S. drone war. Fahrenheit 11/9 probes Donald Trump's deployment of mediated, divisive speech. The particular aim of this article is to demonstrate how these significant and timely works make innovative and oftentimes reflexive use of testimony, drone imaginaries, and 'Border Spectacle', thereby interrupting the lethal agendas of fortress USA.",Drone,2020
A multidomain virtual network embedding algorithm based on multiobjective optimization for Internet of Drones architecture in Industry 4.0,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has a broad application prospect in the future, especially in the Industry 4.0. The development of Internet of Drones (IoD) makes UAV operation more autonomous. Network virtualization technology is a promising technology to support IoD, so the allocation of virtual resources becomes a crucial issue in IoD. How to rationally allocate potential material resources has become an urgent problem to be solved. The main work of this paper is presented as follows: (a) In order to improve the optimization performance and reduce the computation time, we propose a multidomain virtual network embedding algorithm (MP-VNE) adopting the centralized hierarchical multidomain architecture. The proposed algorithm can avoid the local optimum through incorporating the genetic variation factor into the traditional particle swarm optimization process. (b) In order to simplify the multiobjective optimization problem, we transform the multiobjective problem into a single-objective problem through weighted summation method. The results prove that the proposed algorithm can rapidly converge to the optimal solution. (c) In order to reduce the mapping cost, we propose an algorithm for selecting candidate nodes based on the estimated mapping cost. Each physical domain calculates the estimated mapping cost of all nodes according to the formula of the estimated mapping cost, and chooses the node with the lowest estimated mapping cost as the candidate node. The simulation results show that the proposed MP-VNE algorithm has better performance than MC-VNM, LID-VNE, and other algorithms in terms of delay, cost and comprehensive indicators.",Drone,2020
Differential Target Antenna Coupling (DTAC) EM Surveying with Stationary Transmitter Loop and Moving In-Loop Receivers,"Following our previous studies of the Differential Target Antenna Coupling (DTAC) method with horizontal and vertical arrays for EM surveys, in this paper we study the application of the DTAC method to a different configuration, where a large, stationary transmitter loop is on the ground surface. We then run profile lines inside this loop. The DTAC method is effective in eliminating errors due to the large variations in the primary field along profile lines within the transmitting loop. Operational tests show that we obtain more diagnostic DTAC anomalies over buried targets than using just the B-x and B-y data. The DTAC method also produces smaller false-alarm targets due to background geology variations, compared with B-z measurements. The DTAC method can be used with either time- or frequency-domain data and the receiver can be moved on the ground or deployed from an airborne vehicle, such as a drone.",Drone,2020
Drone-Borne Differential SAR Interferometry,"Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) has been widely applied since the pioneering space-borne experiment in 1989, and subsequently with the launch of the ERS-1 program in 1992. The DInSAR technique is well assessed in the case of space-borne SAR data, whereas in the case of data acquired from aerial platforms, such as airplanes, helicopters, and drones, the effective application of this technique is still a challenging task, mainly due to the limited accuracy of the information provided by the navigation systems mounted onboard the platforms. The first airborne DInSAR results for measuring ground displacement appeared in 2003 using L- and X-bands. DInSAR displacement results with long correlation time in P-band were published in 2011. This letter presents a SAR system and, to the best of our knowledge, the first accuracy assessment of the DInSAR technique using a drone-borne SAR in L-band. A deformation map is shown, and the accuracy and resolution of the methodology are presented and discussed. In particular, we have obtained an accuracy better than 1 cm for the measurement of the observed ground displacement. It is in the same order as that achieved with space-borne systems in C- and X-bands and the airborne systems in X-band. However, compared to these systems, we use here a much longer wavelength. Moreover, compared to the satellite experiments available in the literature and aimed at assessing the accuracy of the DInSAR technique, we use only two flight tracks with low time decorrelation effects and not a big data stack, which helps in reducing the atmospheric effects.",Drone,2020
3D Drone Base Station Placement and Resource Allocation With FSO-Based Backhaul in Hotspots,"Deploying a Drone Base Station (DBS) over a hotspot area is a promising solution to improve the user Quality of Service (QoS) by helping the Macro Base Station (MBS) transmit traffic to the users. Essentially, the DBS, which works as a relay node between the users and the MBS, can increase the users' data rates by virtue of more likely short-distance Line of Sight (LoS) communication links. Furthermore, deploying DBS is more cost-effective and flexible as compared to deploying small cells. The DBS can employ Free Space Optical (FSO) links for backhauling between the DBS and the MBS. In this paper, we study the 3D deployment and resource allocation of a DBS in a given hotspot area with the objective of maximizing the throughput in the access link under the constraint of user QoS, the capacity of the backhaul link, and total available bandwidth and power. To solve the problem, we first decompose the primal problem into two subproblems, i.e., the 3D DBS placement problem and the resource allocation problem. Second, we propose a cyclic iterative algorithm to solve the two sub-problems separately and use the output of one as the input of the other. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated via extensive simulations.",Drone,2020
The Mothership and Drone Routing Problem,"The mothership and drone routing problem (MDRP) considers the routing of a two-vehicle tandem. The larger vehicle, which may be a ship or an airplane, is called the mothership; the smaller vehicle, which may be a small boat or unmanned aerial vehicle, is called the drone. We assume that there exists a set of target locations T. For each t in T, the drone must launch from the mothership, visit t, and then return to the mothership to refuel. The drone has a limited range of R time units. In the MDRP, we assume that both mothership and drone operate in the ""open seas"" (i.e., using the Euclidean metric). We also introduce the mothership and infinite-capacity drone routing problem (MDRP-IC), where a drone launches from the mothership and visits one or more targets consecutively before returning to the mothership. Our exact approach uses branch and bound, where each node of the branch-and-bound tree corresponds to a potential subsequence of the order of target visits. A lower bound at each node is given by solving a second-order cone program, which optimally chooses a launch point and landing point for each target in the subsequence. A set of heuristics that also uses a second-order cone program as an embedded procedure is presented. We show that our schemes are flexible to accommodate a variety of additional constraints and/or objective functions. Computational results and interesting variants of the MDRP and MDRP-IC are also presented.",Drone,2020
Complex Field Network Coding for Multi-Source Multi-Relay Single-Destination UAV Cooperative Surveillance Networks,"Relay-based cooperative communication for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can obtain spatial diversity gains, expand coverage, and potentially increase the network capacity. A multi-source multi-relay single-destination structure is the main topology structure for UAV cooperative surveillance networks, which is similar to the structure of network coding (NC). Compared with conventional NC schemes, complex field network coding (CFNC) can achieve a higher throughput and is introduced to surveillance networks in this paper. According to whether there is a direct communication link between any source drone and the destination, the information transfer mechanism at the downlink is set to one of two modes, either mixed or relay transmission, and two corresponding irregular topology structures for CFNC-based networks are proposed. Theoretical analysis and simulation results with an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel show that the CFNC obtains a throughput as high as 1/2 symbol per source per channel use. Moreover, the CFNC applied to the proposed irregular structures under the two transmission modes can achieve better reliability due to full diversity gain as compared to that based on the regular structure. Moreover, the reliability of the CFNC scheme can continue to be improved by combining channel coding and modulation techniques at the expense of rate loss.",Drone,2020
Anisotropic boundary layer mesh generation for reliable 3D unsteady RANS simulations,"This paper proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) framework with the aim of combining consistency and efficiency for the numerical simulation of high Reynolds number flows encountered in engineering applications for aerodynamics. The novelty of the framework is the combination of a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model with an anisotropic mesh adaptation strategy handling arbitrary immersed geometries by building the corresponding boundary layer meshes. The numerical algorithm consists of robust and accurate solution of the unsteady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations supplemented with a Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model and boundary layer remeshing relying on a specifically designed metric. The flow solver is formulated as a Variational Multiscale (VMS) finite element method for the momentum balance and the incompressibility constraint, and as an upwind Petrov-Galerkin method for the nonlinear turbulent equation. The boundary layer remeshing strategy is flexible as it allows the adaptation of arbitrary coarse meshes by modifying the size and the orientation of elements along the immersed boundary to ensure a smooth gradation along the curvature of the body's geometry. The solver is capable of handling highly stretched anisotropic elements and is shown to successfully predict both mean and fluctuating drag/lift coefficients. Laminar and turbulent test cases in 2D and 3D are presented to assess the performance of this framework against experimental results relevant to external aerodynamics, including an airship and a flying drone.",Drone,2020
A bidirectional congestion control transport protocol for the internet of drones,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are composed of energy constrained devices that autonomously form networks through which sensed information is transported from the region of interest to the central control station (sink), integration with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leads to enlarged monitoring area and to enhance overall network performance. Due to application specific nature of wireless sensor networks, it is challenging to design a congestion control protocol that is suitable for all types of applications in the Internet of Drones (IoD). Congestion avoidance and control in wireless sensor networks mainly aims at reducing packet drop due to congestion and maintaining fair bandwidth allocation to all network flows. In this research work, we propose a reliable and congestion based protocol, which provides both bidirectional reliability and rate adjustment based congestion control. It uses Technique for Order Preference by Similarly to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to select optimal path for data transmission because TOPSIS selects an alternative such that it has shortest distance from the ideal one and greatest distance from negative ideal solution. Congestion is detected by using proportion of average packet service time over average packet inter-arrival time as congestion degree. Then, congestion is notified using implicit notification to save energy and reduce overhead. To mitigate congestion along with maintaining fairness, an equal priority index is assigned to all data sources and when congestion occurs, rate adjustment to optimal value based on priority value is used for congestion control. This approach helps to diminish packet drops, maintain fairness and get better energy efficiency. Finally, we compare the performance of the proposed protocol with that of existing protocols. Our simulation results show reduced average delivery overhead, drop packet ratio, queue length and delay with increased average delivery ratio. Moreover, our protocol provides better energy efficiency and fairness when compared with the existing competing protocols.",Drone,2020
Malware classification algorithm using advanced Word2vec-based Bi-LSTM for ground control stations,"Recently, Internet of Drones (IoD) are issued to utilize the diverse kinds of drones for leisure, education and so on. Researchers study to prevent the situations that drones are disabled by cyber-attackers by embedding malwares into the drones and Ground Control Stations (GCS). Therefore, it is required to protect the malwares considering the diverse kinds of features of the drones and GCSs. Signature-based detection approaches are traditionally utilized. However, given that those approaches only scan files partially, some of malwares are not detected. This paper proposes a novel method for finding the malwares in GCSs that utilizes a fastText model to create lower-dimension vectors than those the vectors by one-hot encoding and a bidirectional LSTM model to analyze the correlation with sequential opcodes. In addition, API function names are utilized to increase the classification accuracy of the sequential opcodes. In the experiments, the Microsoft malware classification challenge dataset was utilized and the malwares in the dataset were classified by family types. The proposed method showed the performance improvement of 1.87% comparing with the performance by a one-hot encoding-based approach. When the proposed method was compared with a similar decision tree-based malware detection approach, the performance of the proposed method was improved by 0.76%.",Drone,2020
AMARO-An On-Board Ship Detection and Real-Time Information System,"The monitoring of worldwide ship traffic is a field of high topicality. Activities like piracy, ocean dumping, and refugee transportation are in the news every day. The detection of ships in remotely sensed data from airplanes, drones, or spacecraft contributes to maritime situational awareness. However, the crucial factor is the up-to-dateness of the extracted information. With ground-based processing, the time between image acquisition and delivery of the extracted product data is in the range of several hours, mainly due to the time consumed by storing and transmission of the large image data. By processing and analyzing them on-board and transmitting the product data directly as ship position, heading, and velocity, the delay can be shortened to some minutes. Real-time connections via satellite telecommunication services allow small packets of information to be sent directly to the user without significant delay. The AMARO (Autonomous Real-Time Detection of Moving Maritime Objects) project at DLR is a feasibility study of an on-board ship detection system involving on-board processing and real-time communication. The operation of a prototype system was successfully demonstrated on an airborne platform in spring 2018. The on-ground user could be informed about detected vessels within minutes after sighting without a direct communication link. In this article, the scope, aim, and design of the AMARO system are described, and the results of the flight experiment are presented in detail.",Drone,2020
Joint Sensor Selection and Power Allocation Algorithm for Multiple-Target Tracking of Unmanned Cluster Based on Fuzzy Logic Reasoning,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cluster is gradually attracting more attention, which takes advantage over a traditional single manned platform. Because the size of the UAV platform limits the transmitting power of its own radar, how to reduce the transmitting power while meeting the detection accuracy is necessary. Aim at multiple-target tracking (MTT), a joint radar node selection and power allocation algorithm for radar networks is proposed. The algorithm first uses fuzzy logic reasoning (FLR) to obtain the priority of targets to radars, and designs a radar clustering algorithm based on the priority to form several subradar networks. The radar clustering algorithm simplifies the problem of multiple-radar tracking multiple-target into several problems of multiple-radar tracking a single target, which avoids complex calculations caused by multiple variables in the objective function of joint radar node selection and power allocation model. Considering the uncertainty of the target RCS in practice, the chance-constraint programming (CCP) is used to balance power resource and tracking accuracy. Through the joint radar node selection and power allocation algorithm, the radar networks can use less power resource to achieve a given tracking performance, which is more suitable for working on drone platforms. Finally, the simulation proves the effectiveness of the algorithm.",Drone,2020
Joint Mission Assignment and Topology Management in the Mission-Critical FANET,"In recent years, the emergence of flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) with multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has made it possible to effectively perform not only the far-off missions but also assorted complex missions. In this article, we consider a mission-critical FANET to perform given missions using multiple UAVs, taking into account a dynamic environment with a time-varying network topology. To effectively operate the mission-critical FANET, we study the joint mission assignment and topology management problem aiming at maximizing the weighted sum of mission and network performances, while guaranteeing end-to-end communications between mission-performing UAVs and their corresponding ground control stations, inter-UAV safety distance maintenance, and other mission-related constraints. To address this problem, we first develop three algorithms: one is to construct a mission-critical FANET from scratch, and the others are to manage the network topology and to switch UAV roles between mission performing and data relaying in response to the changes in the network topology. Then, we develop a dynamic mission-critical FANET operation algorithm incorporating the three algorithms with a few rules, by which the mission-critical FANET can be effectively managed and operated with reasonable computational complexity in the dynamic environment. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed algorithm works well in the dynamic environment while satisfying the constraints, and that its performance is not only superior to the existing algorithms but also close to the optimal performance.",Drone,2020
A Cooperative Transmission Scheme in Drone-Based Networks,"In this paper, we propose an uplink multiuser-multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) cooperative retransmission control scheme for the reliable and efficient communication of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (i.e., flight communication and drone-to-drone communication). This scheme is a key element in the design of a drone-based ad-hoc network. Because drone relay transmission operates in the air, flexible wireless relay networks over large areas can be achieved without interference from multipath signals caused by buildings and obstacles in ground-based communication. However, two main challenges exist. First, the relay transmission system occupies bandwidth every time the drone relays information. Therefore, because the radio channel is shared by multiple relay stations, the throughput is greatly reduced. To improve throughput, it is better to transmit using the minimum number of relay stations. Ultimately, long-distance direct transmission is the best. The other issue is a direct result of the first issues solution: the propagation loss increase when relaying information directly over a long distance. Moreover, because the frequency of interference waves from the ground increases, transmission signal errors are an important issue. To solve this issue, a transmission scheme to reduce errors is required. The scheme proposed in this study achieves high transmission reliability and efficiency even under high transmission error conditions. The results of a computer simulation reveal that the proposed method achieves a direct transmission throughput that is 1.5 times better than that of a conventional scheme. It is also shown that the proposed scheme requires only about three stations to achieve acceptable results.",Drone,2020
U-Space Concept of Operations: A Key Enabler for Opening Airspace to Emerging Low-Altitude Operations,"Opening the sky to new classes of airspace user is a political and economic imperative for the European Union. Drone industries have a significant potential for economical growth according to the latest estimations. To enable this growth safely and efficiently, the CORUS project has developed a concept of operations for drones flying in Europe in very low-level airspace, which they have to share that space with manned aviation, and quite soon with urban air mobility aircraft as well. U-space services and the development of smart, automated, interoperable, and sustainable traffic management solutions are presented as the key enabler for achieving this high level of integration. In this paper, we present the U-space concept of operations (ConOps), produced around three new types of airspace volume, called X, Y, and Z, and the relevant U-space services that will need to be supplied in each of these. The paper also describes the reference high-level U-space architecture using the European air traffic management architecture methodology. Finally, the paper proposes the basis for the aircraft separation standards applicable by each volume, to be used by the conflict detection and resolution services of U-space.",Drone,2020
Flexible backhaul-aware DBS-aided HetNet with IBFD communications,"Drone-mounted base-stations (DBSs) are promising complements and substitutes of the terrestrial base-stations. We investigate the problem of Placement and cOmmunications in the DBS-aided heterogeneous network (POD) with tier-1 backhaul using free space optics communications and tier-2 backhaul utilizing in-band full-duplex communications to provide ubiquitous connections and high spectrum efficiency. The POD problem is shown to be NP-hard, and thus we simplify the POD problem by decomposing it into three sub-problems. Finally, we propose an approximation algorithm to solve the POD problem, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to two baseline algorithms.

Evolutionary Autopilot Design Approach for UAV Quadrotor by Using GA,"This paper presents an off-line design strategy of an intelligent 3D autopilot of Micro-UAV Quadrotor. It consists of hybridization between two fuzzy controllers for the x and y motions and four PID classical controllers for the attitude/altitude motions. Genetic algorithms are used to adapt and optimize the value of the six controllers' parameters to achieve the best performance and decrease the consumed energy. Also, in order to ensure the global optimum control parameters, genetic algorithm named Bi-GA is used to automatically configure the two GAs using for the tuning process. This design strategy can be used to different types of Quadrotor (with cross or X configuration). Initially, in order to get the controller parameters, simulation tests are made on a commercial Quadrotor named AR.Drone V2. Finally, these parameters values are tested in an experiment using the robot operating system. The results of these experimentations confirm the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms in the design of intelligent PID autopilot.",Drone,2020
Autonomous Tactical Deployment of the UAV Array Using Self-Organizing Swarm Intelligence,"This article describes how swarm intelligence can be applied to an array of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for strategic deployment. In emergency or disaster-stricken areas, telecommunications and geospatial surveillance are strictly critical for situational control. Base stations may fail to work due to natural disasters. To be rapidly deployed, lightweight drones with multirotors that provide stability are used as mobile stations. An autonomous learning approach, ""self-organizing maps (SOMs),"" which can automatically and adaptively coordinate a large array of autonomous drones-self-organizing UAV array-based on requests from end users (EUs) is embedded inside the array. The size and the topology of a UAV array can be dynamically changed in response to various terrains and relocation of EUs. Moreover, with swarm intelligence, the UAV array is capable of reconfiguring its planar topology into a hierarchical one. Such a hierarchical topology divides the entire UAV array into subarrays and creates isolated heterogeneous networks. Thus, the UAV array can cope with diverse situations across geographical barriers by forming a flying ad hoc network.",Drone,2020
"PiNcH: An effective, efficient, and robust solution to drone detection via network traffic analysis","We propose Picking a Needle in a Haystack (PiNcH), a methodology to detect the presence of a drone, its current status, and its movements by leveraging just the communication traffic exchanged between the drone and its Remote Controller (RC). PiNcH is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic, analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH is fully passive and it requires just cheap and general-purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication traces originated by a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware, currently mounted on-board of a wide range (30+) of commercial amateur drones. Then, we tested our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii) discriminate the movements of the drone; and, finally, (iv) enjoy a reduced upper bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The effectiveness of PiNcH has been also evaluated in the presence of both heavy packet loss and evasion attacks. In this latter case, the adversary modifies on purpose the profile of the traffic of the drone-RC link to avoid the detection. In both the cited cases, PiNcH continues enjoying a remarkable performance. Further, the comparison against state of the art solution confirms the superior performance of PiNcH in several scenarios. Note that all the drone-controller generated data traces have been released as open-source, to allow replicability and foster follow-up. Finally, the quality and viability of our solution, do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone identification and status discrimination, and pave the way for future research in the area.

Mathematical approach to the analysis of terrorism dynamics,"In pursuance of differing goals and ideologies, nations, religions, political groups rising against themselves have characterized human existence over the years. In recent times, such animosities have widened to the point of dehumanization and wide destruction of properties with threat and fear as strong arsenal. Terrorism has become very prevalent especially its many new forms that use drones and chemical and biological weapons. A mathematical model helps to explain a system (mutable natural occurrences such as dynamics in terrorism) by a painstaking study of different components of terrorists' splinter cells ranging from foot soldiers, intelligent mission units, kidnappers, and suicide bombers, to make predictions about its behaviour. This work argues the use of mathematical models to study terrorism by providing insights into evolving trends. The specific objective of this study is to investigate how to improve the understanding of the policymakers on terrorism mitigation. The study adopted a mathematical modelling and theoretical design. The mathematical equations formulated were based on the underlying principles of terrorism, which include recruitment, desertion from group, counter-terrorism measures, et cetera. The models were sets of ordinary nonlinear differential equations based on assumptions emanating from the literature reviewed on terrorism. Qualitative analysis and relevant numerical simulations of the model were carried out. The results illustrate new approach on which terrorism can be reduced.",Drone,2020
"Whenever there's trouble, just yelp for help: Crime, conservation, and corporatization in Paw Patrol","With few exceptions, cultural criminologists have yet to investigate how crime, criminalized individuals, and punishment are depicted in children's television programming. Undertaking the case study of the popular animated children's series PAW Patrol, I find that crime is committed predominantly by literal outsiders and that wrongdoers are temporarily warehoused or forced to engage in hard labor. In this world, politicians are presented as incompetent or unethical and the state, either incapable of delivering or unwilling to provide basic social services to citizens, relies on the PAW Patrol corporation to investigate crime, rescue non-human animals in states of distress, and recycle. I argue that the series suggests to audiences that we can and should rely on corporations and technological advancements to combat crime and conserve, with responsibilized individuals assisting in this endeavor. Ultimately, PAW Patrol echoes core tenets of neoliberalism and encourages complicity in a global capitalist system that (re)produces inequalities and causes environmental harms.",Drone,2020

Detection of Eavesdropping Attack in UAV-Aided Wireless Systems: Unsupervised Learning With One-Class SVM and K-Means Clustering,"A wireless relaying system in the presence of an active eavesdropper is considered. The system is assumed to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a relay and the uplink phase is for authentication. The active eavesdropper is assumed to sneak into the system by attacking the UAV during the process of authentication. To detect the eavesdropping attacks, we consider building predictive models with one-class support vector machines (OC-SVM) and K-means clustering. To prepare datasets for training predictive models, we propose a framework for creating the features of testing data from wireless signals and another framework for generating training data. Our results show the superiority of OC-SVM over K-means in terms of stability, while K-means clustering is better when the eavesdropper uses high power in transmission.",Drone,2020
Drones Are Flying outside of Segregated Airspace in Poland New Rules for BVLOS UAV Operations,"Poland was one of the first European countries to adopt a national regulatory framework for the operation of drones. During its first years (2013-2016), the national regulator was more focused on VLOS operations, and BVLOS operations were possible only in segregated airspace. Since 2019, a new law has allowed for certain types of BVLOS operations to be conducted outside of segregated airspace, at very low levels. This paper will analyze how national legislation is dealing with this new technology, focusing on the new law on BVLOS operations. As the national regulation will be replaced in June 2020 by common European rules that have been adopted 2019, this paper also aims to highlight the most important provisions of the EU regulation.",Drone,2020
Detection of Conflicts Between ADS-B-Equipped Aircraft and Unmanned Aerial Systems,"Versatile unmanned aerial system (UAS) platforms have grown significantly in popularity by virtue of their low cost relative to manned aircraft, high performance, and operational simplicity. While the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently regulates the operating altitudes, speeds, weights, pilot qualifications, and locations of drones, a lack of capacity and technology prohibits sufficient enforcement of these restrictions. To assess the frequency and severity of manned and unmanned aircraft separation incidents, and to examine the emerging sensor technology available to facilitate such assessment, flight operations in controlled airspace around Orlando Melbourne International Airport (KMLB) were monitored. One sensor system deployed at KMLB reported UAS locations, altitudes, and flight durations, while a second system reported manned aircraft positions, altitudes, and timestamps using ADS-B signals. Evaluation of flight operations data in the vicinity of KMLB revealed eight potential drone incursions over a 2-week period. Aircraft flight paths were retroactively tracked to map these unmanned and manned aerial conflicts; aircraft identification information was also researched to contextualize the incidents. The frequency and magnitude of identified events suggest the need for additional research to further explore the problem scope and potential solutions.",Drone,2020
"Cheap fights, credible threats: The future of armed drones and coercion","Drones are considered poor coercion tools: They cannot operate in contested airspace and they offer low-cost fights instead of more credible, costly signals. However, this article finds that technological advances will soon enable drones to function in hostile environments. Moreover, drones offer three unique coercion advantages that theorists did not foresee: sustainability in long duration conflicts, certainty of precision punishment which can change the psychology of adversaries, and changes in the relative costs of war. A unique survey of 259 foreign military officers finds that costly signals are less credible than assumed and that drones demonstrate resolve in new ways.",Drone,2020
Desaf¨ªos normativos para el uso comunitario de drones en M¨¦xico,"Abstract Drones allow obtaining detailed aerial information more autonomously and economically, compared to other sources of remote sensing. This has motivated the civil and community use of drones around the world, both for audiovisual and cartographic purposes. Therefore, governments have had to legislate its use and address various concerns such as aviation security, privacy and data protection. In Mexico, five Mandatory Circulars were issued (2010-2017) and then an Official Standard (2019). Despite its great potential, the community use of drones has not been debated or incorporated into these regulations. Therefore, the objective of this article is to review the Mexican regulatory framework on drones and analyze their impacts on the community use of said technology. The documentary review and its analysis with communities in central Mexico reveal that the legislation does not favor its community use, particularly when it is for mapping purposes. This limitation is due to diverse bureaucratic and economic requirements, as well as the absence of aeronautical cartography of easy access and consultation. In this situation, we discuss the challenges of incorporating the community use of drones into the regulatory framework. Furthermore, we suggest that airspace is an integral part of the territorial rights of indigenous and local communities, and that its legal recognition would favor its community use. Finally, we suggest that the community use of drones could greatly benefit from a regulatory approach based on the risk of operation, establishing requirements and limitations more in line with the heterogeneity of airspace and its traffic. Much of our analysis is also useful for the civil use of drones in Mexico.",Drone,2020

QDR: A Quadrotor Dead Reckoning Framework,"Quadrotors are used for variety of applications both outdoors and indoors. Among them are - deliveries, surveillance, transportation, mapping and more. To accomplish its tasks an accurate navigation solution is required. To that end, most quadrotors apply fusion between an inertial navigation system and other external sensors, such as global navigation satellite systems (outdoors) or vision (indoors/outdoors). Due to environmental or sensor constraints, in some portion of the trajectory, the navigation solution relies only on the inertial navigation system solution. Consequently, the navigation solution drifts in time due to errors and noise in the inertial sensors measurements. Motivated from the pedestrian dead reckoning approach, we propose the quadrotor dead-reckoning framework to mitigate the navigation solution drift in situations of pure inertial navigation. There, instead of a straight line trajectory, the quadrotor is flown with a periodic motion to enable peak to peak distance estimation. Simulation and experiments results show that the proposed approach greatly improves the accuracy of the navigation solution.",Drone,2020
The Design of a TLD and Fuzzy-PID Controller based on the Autonomous Tracking System for Quadrotor Drones,"The objective of this paper is to design a new Quadrotor Autonomous Following System, and the main three contents are as follows: Object tracking, quadrotor attitude determination and the controller. The image tracking portion performs object detection and keeps tracking by way of the Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD), and gets the information of the target motion estimation positions. The attitude determination of the Quadrotor has adopted the Inertial Navigation System and sensors of the accelerometer, gyroscope and electronic compass, etc. for retrieving the information. The Kalman filter is also utilized for estimating the current values in order to reduce external interference, improve the accuracy, and obtain the current posture of the Quadrotor. As for the control method, the mathematical modeling on the Quadrotor is performed first so that the Quadrotor can obtain the correct posture through the three-axis compensations, and then the fuzzy-PID controller may obtain the three-axis following angles for output to execute the commands and track the users. Finally the feasibility of this method is verified by using the flying software simulation and tangible flight experiments.",Drone,2020
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGIES FOR COMMITTING SABOTAGE AND TERRORISM,"The article discusses the problems that arise in connection with the crimes against state and public security committed by use of computer and network technologies. This topic is becoming relevant because some states have already experienced the effects of ¡°combat¡± computer viruses, which can be regarded as waging war using cyber weapons. The most famous example is the attack by the Stuxnet computer virus on an Iranian uranium enrichment plant. The virus was created specifically to disable industrial control systems. The use of unmanned ground and air vehicles to carry out terrorist acts is of particular danger. The Russian military in Syria is constantly confronted with terrorist attacks: the Khmeimim aerospace forces base is regularly attacked with unmanned air vehicles - drones. Terrorist acts with the use of computer and network technologies are no less dangerous. The destructive potential of cyberterrorism is determined by the widespread computerization of state and public life, the implementation of projects to create smart cities, including smart transportation, as well as the intensive development of the Internet of things. The purpose of the article is to analyze new criminal threats to state and public security, as well as to study high-tech ways of committing crimes such as sabotage, terrorist acts, and other crimes of a terrorist nature. The cost of their consequences for society is very high, and criminals do not always need to attack social objects directly - it is enough to spread panic among the population using online media, social networks and websites of authorities of various levels, after obtaining illegal access to them. The article describes some of the techniques already used to commit crimes of sabotage and terrorism. The authors draw attention to the priority of cybersecurity both for engineers of devices with elements of artificial intelligence, and for lawmakers who should pay attention to methods of technical forecasting when developing legal norms aimed at prevention of new ways of committing such crimes. When writing the article, the authors used a wide range of Russian and foreign sources of legal, statistical, sociological and other information. The authors used such research methods as analysis, synthesis, deduction, induction, formal legal method as well as comparative legal method.",Drone,2020
Experimental studies of the radar detection method of a small air target with long-term coherent signal accumulation,"The article discusses the problem of radar detection of small-sized low-speed air targets such as ¡°unmanned aerial vehicle (drone)¡±. An effective means of detecting such targets is a multi-beam radar, which combines the ability to quickly view the protected area and the possibility of long-term coherent accumulation of signals reflected from the target. To analyze the features of the technical implementation of the principle of multi-beam viewing, and to determine the effectiveness of the method of long-term coherent signal accumulation in the detection of small air targets, an experimental multi-beam radar bench has been created. In the course of the work, the tasks of choosing a rational structure and parameters of the radar, substantiating the technical requirements for functional modules and their manufacture were solved. Control algorithms, primary and secondary signal processing are developed. Experimental studies of the characteristics of an experimental radar have been performed. Of the issues considered, the most important are checking the adequacy of the coherence and dynamic range of the receiving path provided in the equipment, analyzing the characteristics of the reflected signals during their long-term coherent accumulation, developing methods and algorithms for suppressing reflections from the ground when detecting low-speed targets. A brief description of the equipment and parameters of the experimental multi-beam radar is given, the results of experimental studies are shown, which showed its high efficiency in the detection of small-sized low-speed objects. Steady operation at short ranges and in rain conditions is shown. The adequacy of the technical solutions adopted when creating the equipment was confirmed. The developed algorithms for primary and secondary signal processing make it possible to obtain radar characteristics close to theoretically calculated and provide suppression of reflections from local objects. Conducted experimental studies of multipath radar showed its high efficiency in the detection of small-sized low-speed targets such as drone. The maximum detection range of drones, depending on their size, lies in the range of 5...10 km, the minimum speed of the detected target does not exceed 1 m / s. Multipath radar can be an effective tool in the complex protection of the object from air attack.",Drone,2020
Spatial GNSS Spoofing Against Drone Swarms With Multiple Antennas and Wiener Filter,"Spoofing of global-navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals to induce a target position estimate is a relevant security threat to the navigation of drones. However, spoofing multiple drones simultaneously as they move in a swarm, without disrupting their formation, is a complex task. In this paper, we propose to transmit spoofing signals from the ground, such that the fake position can be estimated in any point of an area of the plane where the swarm is moving. To this end we filter the satellite-generated GNSS signals with a multidimensional linear filter, and transmit the filtered signal with multiple ground antennas. The multidimensional filter is designed according to a generalized Wiener-filter criterion, such that the fake signal is accurately reproduced (in terms of mean squared error (MSE)) in the whole spoofed area. We investigate the impact of various design parameters (among others, the size of the spoofed area, the number of ground antennas, and the number of spoofed satellites) on both the MSE, and the probability of acquisition of the spoofed signal by the drones.",Drone,2020
Airborne Multi-Channel Ground Penetrating Radar for Improvised Explosive Devices and Landmine Detection,"An improved Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system on board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is presented in this contribution. The system has been designed for the detection and imaging of buried targets and, in particular, landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Resting on the hardware and architecture of a previous aerial platform, in the proposed system the scanning area is increased and the detection capabilities are improved. These improvements are achieved by employing two receiving antennas and new processing techniques that increase the Signal-to-Clutter Ratio of the GPR images. Besides, parameters affecting the GPR image resolution, such as the flight speed and the amount of measurements that can be processed together using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) techniques, are also studied.

Protect Your Sky: A Survey of Counter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems,"Recognizing the various and broad range of applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for personal, public and military applications, recent un-intentional malfunctions of uncontrollable UAVs or intentional attacks on them divert our attention and motivate us to devise a protection system, referred to as a counter UAV system (CUS). The CUS, also known as a counter-drone system, protects personal, commercial, public, and military facilities and areas from uncontrollable and belligerent UAVs by neutralizing or destroying them. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the CUS to describe the key technologies of the CUS and provide sufficient information with wich to comprehend this system. The first part starts with an introduction of general UAVs and the concept of the CUS. In the second part, we provide an extensive survey of the CUS through a top-down approach: i) the platform of CUS including ground and sky platforms and related networks; ii) the architecture of the CUS consisting of sensing systems, command-and-control (C2) systems, and mitigation systems; and iii) the devices and functions with the sensors for detection-and-identification and localization-and-tracking actions and mitigators for neutralization.

LAKE-IoD: Lightweight Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol for the Internet of Drone Environment,"A drone is an unmanned aerial vehicle, which is deployed in a particular Fly Zone (FZ), and used to collect crucial information from its surrounding environment to be transmitted to the server for further processing. Generally, a Mobile User (MU) is required to access the real-time information collected by the drone stationed in a specific FZ securely. Therefore, to ensure secure and reliable communications an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol is imperative to the Internet of Drone (IoD) environment. An AKE scheme ensures only authentic MU to access IoD network resources. Upon successful authentication, MU and drone can set up a secret session key for secure communication in the future. This paper presents a novel Lightweight AKE Protocol for IoD Environment (LAKE-IoD), which first ensures the authenticity of MU and also renders session key establishment mechanism between MU and drone with the help of a server. LAKE-IoD is an AKE protocol, which is based on an authenticated encryption scheme AEGIS, hash function, and bit-wise XOR operation. Meticulous formal security verification by employing a software tool known as Scyther and informal security analysis demonstrates that LAKE-IoD is protected against different well-known active and passive security attacks. Additionally, Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic is applied to verify the logical completeness of LAKE-IoD. Furthermore, a comparison of LAKE-IoD with the related schemes shows that LAKE-IoD incurs less communication, computational and storage overhead.",Drone,2020
Algorithm for determining the orientation elements of an infrared image obtained from a drone using reference points,The article deals with the algorithm for determining the exterior and interior orientation elements of an infrared image obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle using four reference points. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to determine the true position of the image by the defined three-dimensional spatial coordinates of the reference points in the image at the time of shooting. The image plane is built up on the defined points. The coordinates of the principal point of the image are calculated by making a perpendicular from the perspective center to the plane of the image. The focal length is equal to the length of this perpendicular. Euler angles characterizing the position of the camera at the time of shooting are calculated after determining the axes¡¯ directions of the inclined image coordinate system. The proposed algorithm is effective even in the case when all the elements of the image orientation are unknown. Calculations of the image elements on model examples with different initial data show high accuracy. The possibility of obtaining the necessary accuracy for the orthotransformation procedure was confirmed on real images.,Drone,2020
"Accuracy Improvement of Autonomous Straight Take-off Flying Forward, and Landing of a Drone with Deep Reinforcement Learning","Nowadays, drones are expected to be used in several engineering and safety applications both indoors and outdoors, e.g., exploration, rescue, sport, entertainment, and convenience. Among those applications, it is important to make a drone capable of flying autonomously to carry out an inspection patrol. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses ArUco markers as a reference to improve the accuracy of a drone on autonomous straight take-off, flying forward, and landing based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). More specifically, the drone first detects a specific marker with one of its onboard cameras. Then it calculates the position and orientation relative to the marker so as to adjust its actions for achieving better accuracy with a DRL method. We perform several simulation experiments with different settings, i.e., different sets of states, different sets of actions and even different DRL methods, by using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and its Gazebo simulator. Simulation results show that our proposed methods can efficiently improve the accuracy of the considered actions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.",Drone,2020
Conceptual redesign of the B-1B bomber inlets for improved supersonic,"This paper presents a conceptual study of two alternative inlet concepts for the United States Air Force B-1B bomber to provide for improved supersonic performance with expansion of capabilities to high-altitude, high-speed flight at Mach 2.0. The two inlet concepts are two-dimensional, variable-ramp inlet systems designed to replace the current fixed-geometry, pitot inlets of the B-1B. One inlet incorporates a two-ramp system, while a second inlet incorporates a two-ramp system containing an isentropic contour. The entire inlet system including the supersonic diffuser, throat, cowl lip, and subsonic diffuser sections was designed to maximize the total pressure recovery at the engine fan face to achieve maximum thrust by the engine at Mach 2.0 conditions. Analytic methods implemented into the MATLAB and the NASA SUPIN codes are used to design and analyze the two-dimensional inlet concepts. In addition, WIND-US computational fluid dynamics simulations were used to check and improve the results of the analytic design methods. The results suggest that at Mach 2.0, the total pressure recovery of the inlets could increase from 0.70 to 0.94. The inlet capture area and cowl drag increased; however, the overall improvements resulted in a 98% thrust increase over the existing inlet at the design point.

Aeroservoelastic analysis of the B-2 bomber,"In the early stages of the development of the B-2 bomber, the technical challenges posed by the aeroelastic characteristics of the all-wing aircraft were recognized. The configuration's near-neutral pitch stability and light wing loading made the aircraft highly responsive to atmospheric turbulence. This dictated the requirement for an active digital Eight control system to provide both stability augmentation and gust load alleviation. The gust load alleviation flight control system was designed by a multidisciplinary team using a combination of optimal and classical control design techniques. The analytical models included linearized approximations of the digital control law mechanization. Flight-test data analysis included the extraction of the vehicle open-loop response, which compared well with the analytical predictions. The multidisciplinary design approach resulted in the successful development of a control augmentation system that provides the B-2 with superb handling characteristics, acceptable low-altitude ride quality, and substantial alleviation of gust loads on the airframe.",Bomber,2020
Integration of GPS into the B-2 Stealth Bomber,The B-2 Navigation Subsystem (NSS) was originally designed to perform autonomous missions without GPS aiding. Its performance requirements were demanding because they were driven by strategic requirements that precluded reliance on navigation aids that could be rendered inoperable during a strategic conflict. To meet these requirements the NSS uses two conventional local level platforms with very high quality inertial instruments. One of the IMUs is stellar aided to bound the error buildup due to gyro drift. The NS can also be aided by range and range rate measurements to known landmarks using the B-2's Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).,Bomber,2020
"United States nuclear weapons, 2021","The Nuclear Notebook is researched and written by Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project with the Federation of American Scientists, and Matt Korda, a research associate with the project. The Nuclear Notebook column has been published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists since 1987. This issue examines the status of the US nuclear arsenal. The US nuclear arsenal remained roughly unchanged in the last year, with the Defense Department maintaining an estimated stockpile of approximately 3,800 warheads. Of these, only 1,800 warheads are deployed, while approximately 2,000 are held in reserve. Additionally, approximately 1,750 retired warheads are awaiting dismantlement, giving a total inventory of approximately 5,550 nuclear warheads. Of the approximately 1,800 warheads that are deployed, 400 are on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, roughly 1,000 are on submarine-launched ballistic missiles, 300 are at bomber bases in the United States, and 100 tactical bombs are at European bases.",Bomber,2021
"Crossing the Red Line?': The Air Staff, Sir Arthur Harris, and the Magdeburg Operation of 21/22 January 1944","On 21/22 January 1944, RAF Bomber Command conducted an area-bombing attack on the city of Magdeburg. The outcome was hardly pleasing, marked by high losses and inaccurate bombing. However, most notable was the rancorous aftermath, in which a full-blown row would erupt between the Air Ministry and Bomber Command Headquarters. This stemmed from the Air Staff perceiving that Sir Arthur Harris had 'crossed a red line' in his non-cooperation with their bombing policy. But the truth was much less clear-cut, as this article will show. Nonetheless, the Magdeburg operation led to a new Directive on 28 January 1944, which would force Harris's cooperation in a combined Anglo-American assault against the German aircraft industry.",Bomber,2020
Drone Launched Short Range Rockets,"A concept of drone launched short range rockets (DLSRR) is presented. A drone or an aircraft rises DLSRR to a release altitude of up to 20 km. At the release altitude, the drone or an aircraft is moving at a velocity of up to 700 m/s and a steep angle of up to 68 degrees to the horizontal. After DLSRRs are released, their motors start firing. DLSRRs use slow burning motors to gain altitude and velocity. At the apogee of their flight, DLSRRs release projectiles which fly to the target and strike it at high impact velocity. The projectiles reach a target at ranges of up to 442 km and impact velocities up to 1.88 km/s. We show that a rocket launched at high altitude and high initial velocity does not need expensive thermal protection to survive ascent. Delivery of munitions to target by DLSRRs should be much less expensive than delivery by a conventional rocket. Even though delivery of munitions by bomber aircraft is even less expensive, a bomber needs to fly close to the target, while a DLSRR carrier releases the rockets from a distance of at least 200 km from the target. All parameters of DLSRRs, and their trajectories are calculated based on theoretical (mechanical and thermodynamical) analysis and on several MatLab programs.",Bomber,2020
"Black and Silver: Perceptions and Memories of the B-29 Bomber, American Strategic Bombing and the Longest Bombing Missions of the Second World War on Singapore","The American strategic bombing of Japan and Japanese-occupied territories during the Second World War resulted in different perspectives of the aerial bombing, both during the war and in post-war memories. Drawing upon eye-witness accounts and memories, the difference in perspectives are compared and critiqued. The longest bombing missions of the war on Singapore are used as a case study to frame the analysis. While Japanese eyewitnesses viewed the American B-29 bombing raids with dread, Singapore's war-time generation largely welcomed the advent of American air raids and viewed it as salvation from the Japanese occupation.",Bomber,2020
Ongoing organizational reforms of the People's Liberation Army Air Force,"Since the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) Central Military Commission launched a major reorganisation of the entire People's Liberation Army (PLA) in early 2016, the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) has followed up with its own reforms at all levels. In February 2016, the changes entailed 'above the neck' reforms at PLAAF Headquarters and reduced the number of Military Region Air Force Headquarters from 7 to 5, renaming them Theatre Command Air Forces. Changes in 2017 focused on 'below the neck' reforms by creating a 'base-brigade' structure by reforming several command posts into bases; abolishing fighter, fighter-bomber, and ground attack aircraft air divisions; replacing air regiments with brigades; as well as changing the name of its former 15th Airborne Corps to Airborne Corps. Whilst the PLA leadership has moved ahead with pushing the PLAAF towards becoming a modern air force with enhanced aerial power alongside greater interoperability with the other PLA services, the reconstitution of its organisations has nevertheless led to a fallout due to policy changes concerning its rank-and-file.",Bomber,2021
A sequential partial information bomber-defender shooting problem,"A bomber carrying homogenous weapons sequentially engages ground targets capable of retaliation. Upon reaching a target, the bomber may fire a weapon at it. If the target survives the direct fire, it can either return fire or choose to hold fire (play dead). If the former occurs, the bomber is immediately made aware that the target is alive. If no return fire is seen, the true status of the target is unknown to the bomber. After the current engagement, the bomber, if still alive, can either re-engage the same target or move on to the next target in the sequence. The bomber seeks to maximize the expected cumulative damage it can inflict on the targets. We solve the perfect and partial information problems, where a target always fires back and sometimes fires back respectively using stochastic dynamic programming. The perfect information scenario yields an appealing threshold based bombing policy. Indeed, the marginal future reward is the threshold at which the control policy switches and furthermore, the threshold is monotonic decreasing with the number of weapons left with the bomber and monotonic nondecreasing with the number of targets left in the mission. For the partial information scenario, we show via a counterexample that the marginal future reward is not the threshold at which the control switches. In light of the negative result, we provide an appealing threshold based heuristic instead. Finally, we address the partial information game, where the target can choose to fire back and establish the Nash equilibrium strategies for a representative two target scenario.",Bomber,2020
Rising Costs: Augustine Revisited,"Rising military equipment costs were famously identified by Norman Augustine with forecasts of a single aircraft air force by 2054. This paper presents and analyses an original data set for UK military aircraft. It provides evidence on cost escalation for various UK aircraft types comprising fighter/strike, bombers, military transports, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters, trainers and civil aircraft. Continued cost escalation is identified for almost all types but with different cost escalation factors. It is concluded that the specific Augustine hypothesis of costs rising by a factor of four every 10 years might be an under-estimate.",Bomber,2020
Navegaci¨®n e historia de la ciencia: el incidente Laconia y la guerra total en la mar (Derecho de la Guerra),"Abstract On September 12, 1942, the British ship Laconia was sunk off the coast of West Africa by the submarine U Boat 156 commanded by Korvettenkapit?n Werner Hartenstein. The Laconia carried 1,800 Italian war prisoners, 80 civilians and 428 British and Polish soldiers. After the disaster, seeing the situation, Hartenstein began his work fulfilling the duty of relief and displaying a Red Cross flag. Despite this, an American B-24 bomber attacked thus expanding the disaster. British propaganda displayed the idea that German submarines mercilessly attacked convoys. The ""Laconia Order"" was not completely fulfilled because the Germans continued their help despite the ""letter"" of that order. The U-Boat Commander, Karl D?nitz, was prosecuted in Nuremberg, and the testimony of Admiral Nimitz clarified many things. Those who died remain in the Atlantic Ocean. Rest in peace.",Bomber,2020
Ground-Aided Precision Strike. Heavy Bomber Activity in Operation Enduring Freedom," The advent of near-precision weapons, particularly the joint direct attack munition (JDAM), offers the combined/ joint force air component commander (C/JFACC) a new tool to utilize for close air support (CAS) operations. In the above epigraph, Maj Gen Daniel Leaf describes how the USAF never envisioned bombers supporting ground troops with this form of CAS. However, this mission goes beyond the support of forces on the ground. This is a new mission in itself, with heavy precise firepower being the maneuver element In the sky, supported by small groups of forces on the ground. The following question is central to this paper: Does the coordination between heavy bombers and terminal attack controllers along with employment of near-precision weapons constitute a new mission for the USAF. A proposed term for this new mission is ground-aided precision strike (GAPS).",Bomber,2020
Options for Enhancing the Bomber Force,"The United States is in the process of modernizing its heavy bombers and weapons stocks so that they can be more useful in conventional conflicts. With those improvements, bombers could fly combat missions directly from the United States while other forces rushed to the region. That capability makes them attractive to a U.S. military that is smaller and based mostly at home. Debate rages about whether the planned bomber force has adequate capabilities and what, if anything, should be done to improve it. This Congressional Budget Office (CBO) paper analyzes the costs and capabilities of the Administration's planned bomber force. It also examines four options that would enhance capability in different ways: making the force larger by buying 20 more B-2s or by keeping all 94 B-52Hs, or improving the force by adding weapons and mission- planning systems or by stockpiling spare parts and equipment at bases near the Persian Gulf and Korea. This analysis was requested by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee.",Bomber,2020
Fault-Tolerant Adaptive Model Inversion Control for Vision-Based,"The practical autonomous air refueling of unmanned air systemtanker aircraft to unmanned air system receiver aircraft will require an integrated relative navigation system and controller that is tolerant to faults. This paper develops and demonstrates a fault-tolerant structured-adaptive-model-inversion controller integrated with a reliable relative-position sensor for this autonomous air-refueling scenario using the probe-and-drogue method. The structured-adaptive-model-inversion controller does not depend on fault-detection information, yet reconfigures and provides smooth trajectory tracking and probe docking in the presence of control-effector failure. The controller also handles parameter uncertainty in the receiver-aircraft model. In this paper, the controller is integrated with a vision-based relative-position sensor, which tracks the relative position of the drogue, and a reference-trajectory generator. The feasibility and performance of the controller and integrated system are demonstrated with simulated docking maneuvers with a nonstationary drogue, in the presence of system uncertainties and control-effector failures. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that the integrated controller/sensor system can provide successful docking in the presence of system uncertainties for a specified class of control-effector failures.",Refueling aircraft,2017

Fault Diagnosis in Air Data Sensors for Receiver Aircraft in Aerial,"Multiple air-data sensors placed on different positions on an aircraft are usually expected to provide identical measurements. This is because aircraft are assumed to fly in no-wind or uniform wind conditions. There are cases, however, where an aircraft flies in nonuniform wind vector field with significant variations in magnitude and direction over the dimensions of the aircraft. For example, in an aerial refueling operation, the receiver aircraft needs to fly within the nonuniform wind field induced by the wake of the tanker aircraft. This paper shows that an air-data sensor fault detection and isolation algorithm, if developed with an underlying assumption of identical sensor measurements, yields very high false detection rate when the aircraft enters the wake of another aircraft. This paper also presents a novel modification to the redundant-sensor-based fault detection and isolation algorithm that eliminates this problem. The new method is based on a model of the wind field as a function of relative position with respect to the tanker aircraft. This model is used to compute the expected values of air-data sensor measurements given the position of the receiver aircraft relative to the tanker.",Refueling aircraft,2015

Pruning operator for minimum deck wind in carrier aircraft launch,"Launch resources and flight safety are important for carrier-based aircraft to takeoff. Aimed at making full use of marine wind resources, a pruning operator added to linear random search algorithm is developed to solve the minimum deck wind for carrier aircraft launch. On the basis of problem statement, the catapult safety criteria are quantified as the boundary condition of the critical solution. Then the mathematical model is established for the algorithm including pruning schematic. The influence of deck wind on aircraft catapult launch is analyzed. With the algorithm proceeding and the feedback results of aircraft catapult launch simulation, the optimal solution of the minimum deck wind is determined in a few simulation times. The main contribution of this research is the development of the pruning operator to greatly shorten the search times under permissible error for the discrete linear problems. And the minimum deck wind is solved in full takeoff weight range due to combining linear random search algorithm and simulation.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Exploring mission planning method for a team of carrier aircraft,"High-level efficiency and safety are of great significance for improving the fighting capability of an aircraft carrier. One way to enhance efficiency and safety level is to organize the carrier aircraft into combat effectively. This paper studies the mission planning problem for a team of carrier aircraft launching, and a novel distributed mission planning architecture is proposed. The architecture is hierarchical and is comprised of four levels, namely, the input level, the coordination level, the path planning level and the execution level. Realistic constraints in each level of the distributed architecture, such as the vortex flow effect, the crowd effect and the motion of aircraft, are considered in the model. To solve this problem, a distributed path planning algorithm based on the asynchronous planning strategy is developed. The proposed Mission Planning Approach for Carrier Aircraft Launching (MPACAL) is validated using the setups of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. Compared to the isolated planning architecture and the centralized planning architecture, the proposed distributed planning architecture has advantages in coordinating the launch tasks not only belonging to the same catapult but also when all different catapults are considered. The proposed MPACAL provides a modeling method for the flight deck operation on aircraft carrier. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

A Dynamic Scheduling Method for Carrier Aircraft Support Operation under,"D The efficient scheduling of carrier aircraft support operations in the flight deck is important for battle performances. The supporting operations and maintenance processes involve multiple support resources, complex scheduling process, and multiple constraints; the efficient coordination of these processes can be considered a multi-resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (MRCMPSP), which is a complex non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. The renewable resources include the operational crews, resource stations, and operational spaces, and the non-renewable resources include oil, gas, weapons, and electric power. An integer programming mathematical model is established to solve this problem. A periodic and event-driven rolling horizon (RH) scheduling strategy inspired by the RH optimization method from predictive control technology is presented for the dynamic scheduling environment. The periodic horizon scheduling strategy can track the changes of the carrier aircraft supporting system, and the improved event-driven mechanism can avoid unnecessary scheduling with effective resource allocation under uncertain conditions. The dual population genetic algorithm (DPGA) is designed to solve the large-scale scheduling problem. The activity list encoding method is proposed, and a new adaptive crossover and mutation strategy is designed to improve the global exploration ability. The double schedule for leftward and rightward populations is integrated into the genetic process of alternating iterations to improve the convergence speed and decrease the computation amount. The computational results show that our approach is effective at solving the scheduling problem in the dynamic environment, as well as making better decisions regarding disruption on a real-time basis.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Aerodynamic and static stability investigation into aircraft coupled system to suborbital space flights,"PurposeThe aim of the research is to conduct a study into a configuration of an aircraft system with a focus on aerodynamics. In addition, trim condition and static stability constraints were included. The main application of this system is suborbital space flights. The presented concept of a modular airplane system (MAS) consists of two vehicles: a Rocket Plane and a Carrier. Both are designed in tailless configurations but coupled formed a classic tail aircraft configuration, where the Rocket Plane works as the empennage. The most important challenge is to define the mutual position of those two tailless vehicles under the assumption that each vehicle will be operating alone in different flight conditions while joined in one object create a conventional aircraft. Each vehicle configuration (separated and coupled) must fulfil static stability and trim requirements.Design/methodology/approachAircrafts' aerodynamic characteristics were obtained using the MGAERO software which is a commercial computing fluid dynamics tool created by AMI Aero. This software uses the Euler flow model. Results from this software were used in the static stability and trim condition analysis.FindingsThe main outcome of this investigation is a mutual position of the Rocket Plane and the Carrier that fulfils project requirements. Also, the final configuration of both separated vehicles (Rocket Plane and Carrier) and the complete MAS were defined. In addition, it was observed that in the case of classic aircraft configuration which is created by connecting two tailless vehicles increasing horizontal tail arm reduces static stability. This is related to a significantly higher mass ratio of the horizontal tail (the Rocket Plane) with respect to the whole system. Moving backward, the Rocket Plane has a notable effect on a position of a centre of gravity of the whole system static stability. Moreover, the impact of the mutual vehicles' position (horizontal tail arm) and inclination angle on the coupled vehicle lift to drag ratio was analysed.Research limitations/implicationsIn terms of aerodynamic computation, MGAERO software using an inviscid flow model, therefore, both a friction drag and breakdown of vortex are not considered. But the presented research is for the computation stage of the design, and the MGAERO software guarantees satisfactory accuracy with respect to the relatively low time of computations. The second limitation is that the presented results are for the conceptual stage of the design and dynamic stability constraints were not taken into account.Practical implicationsThe ultimate goal of the coupled aircraft project is to conduct flying tests and the presented result is one of the milestones to achieve this goal.Originality/valueA design process for a conventional aircraft configuration is well known however, there are not many examples of vehicles that consist of two coupled aircrafts where both vehicles have similar mass. The unique part of this paper includes results of the investigation of the mutual position of the vehicles that can fly alone, as well as in coupled form. The impact of the position of the centre of gravity on trim conditions and static stability of the coupled configuration was investigated.",Carrier aircraft,2021
Longitudinal automatic carrier-landing control law rejecting disturbances and coupling based on adaptive dynamic inversion,"The longitudinal automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) control law is designed based on nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI), which can reject air wake, decouple lateral states, and track the dynamic desired touchdown point (DTP). First of all, the nonlinear landing model of F/A-18 aircraft in the final approach is established, in which the parameters of the aerodynamic. control surfaces, and limited states are acquired. Second, the strategy of tracking the desired longitudinal trajectory through pitch angle control is adopted. The automatic power compensation system (APCS), pitch angle rate, pitch angle, and vertical position control loops are developed based on the adaptive NDI. The stable analysis and the principal description are derived in detail. Deck motion compensation (DMC) algorithm is designed by frequency response method. Third. the control parameters are optimized through the genetic algorithm. A fitness function integrated with velocity, angle of attack (AOA), pitch rate, pitch angle, and vertical position of the aircraft are proposed. Finally, integrated simulations are conducted on a semi-physical simulation platform. The results indicate that the adopted automatic landing control law can achieve both excellent performance and the ability to reject the air wake and lateral coupling.",Carrier aircraft,2021
A pretrained proximal policy optimization algorithm with reward shaping for aircraft guidance to a moving destination in three-dimensional continuous space,"To enhance the performance of guiding an aircraft to a moving destination in a certain direction in three-dimensional continuous space, it is essential to develop an efficient intelligent algorithm. In this article, a pretrained proximal policy optimization (PPO) with reward shaping algorithm, which does not require an accurate model, is proposed to solve the guidance problem of manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Continuous action reward function and position reward function are presented, by which the training speed is increased and the performance of the generated trajectory is improved. Using pretrained PPO, a new agent can be trained efficiently for a new task. A reinforcement learning framework is built, in which an agent can be trained to generate a reference trajectory or a series of guidance instructions. General simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the training efficiency and trajectory performance. The carrier-based aircraft approach simulation is carried out to prove the application value of the proposed approach.",Carrier aircraft,2021
FMAC: A Self-Adaptive MAC Protocol for Flocking of Flying Ad Hoc Network,"Considering the high-density and high-dynamic feature of cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) swarm, also referred to as flocking of flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), reliable medium access control (MAC) protocol design for network connectivity maintaining and network information sharing is a challenging issue. In this article, we propose a self-adaptive carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)-based MAC protocol for flocking of FANET, namely, FMAC, to provide reliable broadcast information service under density-varying flocking scenarios. To represent the varying trend of UAV density during flocking, we define the collective neighboring potential (CNP) in the FMAC protocol. Specifically, at the beginning of each period, each UAV computes the current CNP based on available neighbors' motion states. Then, the value of CNP at the start of the next period regarding the same neighbors is predicted using UAV's kinetic equation. After that, each UAV can update the contention window (CW) size by comparing the current CNP and the predicted CNP, and CW will be decreased (increased) if the current CNP is larger (smaller) than the predicted one for enough period. The simulation results show that the proposed FMAC protocol can ensure high successful transmission probability under density-varying flocking scenarios and outperforms the typical MAC solutions.",Carrier aircraft,2021
Fixed-time control for automatic carrier landing with disturbance,"This paper addresses the fixed-time control problem for automatic carrier landing. By transforming a six-degrees-of-freedom fixed-wing aircraft model into the affine form with angle of attack controlled by thrust independently, backstepping technique is able to be adopted as the main control frame. Subsequently, for the purpose of improving convergent performance and success rate for carrier landing, fixed-time control method for a high-order multivariable system is proposed, and it is applied to the automatic carrier landing control system. In order to realize complete fixed-time convergence performance for the closed-loop system, fixed-time disturbance observers are employed in the control structure to efficiently estimate the external disturbances. Moreover, nonlinear fixed-time filters are incorporated to avoid tedious derivative calculation without affecting the fixed-time convergence performance of the system. Finally, the comparative simulation results with other methods demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed fixed-time control scheme. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Unconventionally Designed Tracking Loop Adaptable to Plasma Sheath Channel for Hypersonic Vehicles,"An aircraft that moves through the atmosphere at hypersonic speed is covered by plasma sheath, which causes random and fast time-varying amplitude attenuation and phase fluctuation in received signals. This paper comprehensively analyzes the mechanism of the amplitude attenuation effects on a traditional phase-locked loop (PLL), which is always ignored in traditional scenarios (such as satellite telemetry and vehicle communication). Simulation results and theoretical analysis showed that traditional PLL does not work reliably for signal carrier tracking with the severe time-varying amplitude attenuation of the plasma sheath channel. In this paper, an unconventionally designed Kalman filter (KF) tracking loop that is aware of phase dynamics and amplitude attenuation fluctuation for hypersonic vehicles is proposed. To introduce time-varying amplitude attenuation into the proposed KF-based tracking loop, the amplitude attenuation is first modeled with an autoregressive model. The statistical characteristics of the amplitude and phase fluctuation are then incorporated into the state equation and observation equation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed tracking loop is stable when the signal-to-noise ratio is -10 dB with the Ka band, even in the most severe flight environment for hypersonic vehicles.",Carrier aircraft,2021
A review on carrier aircraft dispatch path planning and control on deck,"As an important part in sortie/recovery process, the dispatch of carrier aircraft not only affects the sortie/recovery efficiency and safety, but also has severe influence on the carrier's combat efficiency and the comprehensive support capability. Path planning is the key to improve the efficiency and safety during the dispatch process.

Three different dispatch modes of carrier aircraft and the corresponding modeling technologies are investigated, and the aircraft's dispatch path planning techniques and algorithms have been classified into different classes. Moreover, their assumptions and drawbacks have been discussed for single aircraft and multiple aircraft. To make the research work more comprehensive, the corresponding tracking control methodologies are also discussed.

Multiple E-2D Hawkeye Aircrew with Neurocognitive Symptoms During a Single Over-Pressurization Episode,"BACKGROUND: Increased frequencies of physiological episodes have been a significant concern for Naval Aviation for the last several years.These include several aircraft platforms, but no previously documented E-2D Hawkeye events.This report documents an episode in an E-2D, with multiple aircrew affected at the same time.CASE REPORT: While deployed aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier, five E-2D Hawkeyes aircrew were simultaneously exposed to the same over-pressurization during a routine sortie. Out of the five aircrew, four immediately reported hypoxic-like neurocognitive symptoms of ""mental slowing"", difficulty concentrating, and headache.They were evaluated and treated using standard protocol according to the Physiologic Event Clinical Practice Guidelines set by the Naval Safety Center. All aircrew were treated with 100% ground level oxygen with resolution of symptoms.DISCUSSION: Although rare, physiological events may occur in multi passenger platforms such as the E-2D Hawkeye. Utilizing and strictly adhering to standard clinical practice guidelines provided an efficient process of evaluation by different flight surgeons concurrently that avoided a possible delay in treatment. After, eliminating other potential etiology for the crew's symptoms, a pressure-related mechanism of injury appears to be the most probable cause.",Carrier aircraft,2020

A multi-objective hyper heuristic framework for integrated optimization of carrier-based aircraft flight deck operations scheduling and resource configuration,"It is of great significance to produce an efficient flight deck operations scheduling plan for improving the carrier-based aircraft sortie rate and enhancing the combat capability of aircraft carrier formation. Flight deck operations scheduling plan is closely related to flight deck resource configuration. In this paper, in order to find a feasible method to produce an effective operations scheduling plan under different resource configurations, the flight deck operations scheduling problem and resource configuration optimization problem for the pre-flight preparation stage are studied simultaneously. The work is different from the existing literature in three aspects: (1) with considering the transfer time of resources and multiple operation execution modes and analyzing the precedence constraints and resource constraints for the flight deck operations, the integrated optimization model of operations scheduling and resource configuration is established and regarded as a multi-objective optimization model. (2) a novel choice function based multi-objective hyper heuristic is proposed for solving the model. The low level heuristics are three well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and the heuristic selection strategy is an online learning choice function. (3) in order to further improve the performance of proposed hyper heuristic, two modified hyper heuristics are introduced, one of which uses a simulated annealing-based non-deterministic move acceptance strategy and the other uses a modified initiation method, a simulated binary crossover operator, and a normal distribution sampling mutation operator. By conducting simulation experiments in the case study section, the correctness of the model and the superiority of the multi-objective hyper heuristic framework are verified.

Constant Force Spring System With a Spiral,"The paper is devoted to the theory of a mechanism called constant force spring system. The system consists of a linear helical spring, a spiral drum, a take-up pulley, and two cords. The spiral drum and the take-up pulley are attached rigidly to each other. One of the cords connects the spring with the spiral drum, and at the initial position of the system fills the entire spiral groove on the drum. During the operation of the system, the spiral drum may rotate about its center, and the cord may gradually unwind from the spiral and wind again. The process of winding/unwinding causes the spring to change its length and change the force it exerts on the spiral drum. Due to the shape of the spiral, the distance of the cord from the center of the drum changes, so that the force in the other cord which is wound on the take-up pulley remains constant. Creation of that constant force is the goal of the system. The heart of the system is a specially designed spiral. The solution to the associated differential equation is provided. The system may allow to eliminate weight towers in exercise machines; eliminate counterweights in elevators, as well as in windows that open by moving upwards. The landing path of fighter planes' landing on aircraft carriers may be reduced. The spiral of the system exhibits an important property which may interest mathematicians; its behavior is compared with that of the Archimedes' and logarithmic spirals. Because of this property, the spiral may find other applications.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Analysis on harmonic characteristics of interleaving paralleled static inverters under asymmetric conditions,"With the large number of applications for multi electric aircraft (MEA), the power capacity of the aviation static inverter (ASI) has been continuously improved. Therefore, more and more modular parallel-based topologies are being used in the ASI to achieve power expansion. Combined with carrier phase-shift modulation, the harmonic components of a system can be further reduced. However, due to the parameter asymmetry between paralleled modules and power system disturbances, additional low frequency and DC bias components are superimposed on the control signal. This paper uses exponential function analysis to analyze the harmonic distribution of a modular ASI based on carrier phase-shift modulation under non-ideal conditions. In addition, the distribution characteristics of different paralleled topologies are compared. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation and experimental results.",Carrier aircraft,2021
Prediction and evaluation of the stage-separation compatibility of an internally carried air-launch vehicle,"This work mainly predicts and evaluates the stage-separation compatibility of an internally carried air-launch vehicle by a multi-body separation wind-tunnel free-flight (WTFF) test without restraining the motional freedom. The Mach number is Ma = 1.5, and the initial-launch angle of attack is considered to be alpha(0) = 0 degrees and alpha(0) = 3 degrees. The result shows that WTFF test is a feasible prediction and evaluation method for the stage-separation compatibility of an ICAL vehicle when the combined vehicle exhibits static stability. The launch-vehicle can be separated safely from the carrier-aircraft and has a good pitch-angle for ignition when alpha(0) = 0 degrees. However, the launch-vehicle exhibits a large pitch-angle when it separates completely from the carrier-aircraft when alpha(0) = 3 degrees, which is unacceptable. Different separation velocities have little influence on the stage-separation compatibility of the ICAL vehicle when alpha(0) = 3 degrees. The stage-separation compatibility of the ICAL vehicle is first investigated by a free-flight technique in a wind-tunnel, which provides a new research idea for interdisciplinary studies of the kinematics and aerodynamics of multi-body systems.

Towards In-Flight Transfer of Payloads Between Multirotors,"Multirotor unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are often used to transport a variety of payloads. However, the maximum time that the cargo can remain airborne is limited by the flight endurance of the UAS. In this letter, we present a novel approach for two multirotors to transfer a payload between them in-air, while keeping the payload aloft and stationary. Our framework is built on a visual-feedback and grasping pipeline that enables one UAS to grasp the payload held by another, thereby allowing the UASs to act as swappable carriers. By connecting the payload outwards along a single rigid link, and allowing the UASs to maneuver about it, we let the payload remain online while it is transferred to a different carrier. Furthermore, building entirely on monocular vision, the approach does not rely on precise extrinsic localization systems. We demonstrate our proposed strategy in a variety of indoor and GPS-free outdoor experiments, and explore the range of operating limits for our system.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Improved Envelope Spectrum via Feature Optimisation-gram (IESFOgram): A novel tool for rolling element bearing diagnostics under non-stationary operating conditions,"Demodulation methods are widely used for bearing diagnostics, based often on the (Squared) Envelope Spectrum after band pass filtering. One of the main challenges of these methods is the detection of a suitable band for signal demodulation under varying speed conditions. Angular resampling methods may synchronize the impulsive nature of bearing damages with a certain periodicity, in the case of large speed fluctuations. On the other hand, the time-invariant carrier frequencies may spread over the broadband of the spectrum, making impossible the application of many band selection tools. Lately, focus has been targeted to cyclostationary-based tools, such as the Cyclic Spectral Correlation and the Cyclic Spectral Coherence, which achieve a high performance in detecting hidden cyclic periodicities. Initially, these methods have been represented in the Frequency-Frequency domain, however they have been extended, to the Order-Order and the Order-Frequency domains, to be able to describe signals under varying speed conditions. The integration of these bi-variable maps over a specific frequency band results to an equivalent to a demodulated spectrum. Therefore, the challenge is the selection of the proper integration band to obtain these demodulated spectra for bearing diagnostics. In this paper, a novel tool called the Improved Envelope Spectrum via Feature Optimization-gram (IESFOgram) is proposed as a band selection tool for the demodulation of the bi-variable map (CSC or CSCoh) for bearing diagnostics. The method is represented in a 1/3-binary tree and is applicable under constant and variable speed conditions. The methodology is tested and validated on real data captured on a laboratory planetary gearbox and on an aircraft engine gearbox, under both constant and varying speed conditions. Furthermore, the methodology is compared in terms of performance with the Fast Kurtogram and the Autogram-based methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Carrier aircraft,2020
A sizing-based approach to evaluate hypersonic demonstrators: demonstrator-carrier constraints,"The objective of this study is to identify, evaluate, and provide recommendations towards the realisation of near-term hypersonic flight hardware through the consideration of carrier vehicle constraints. The current rush of available funds for hypersonic research cannot cause a program to ignore growth potential for future missions. The prior NB-52 carrier vehicles, famous for the X-15 and X-43A missions, are retired. Next generation hypersonic demonstrator requirements will necessitate a substitution of carrier vehicle capability. Flight vehicle configuration, technology requirements, and recommendations are arrived at by constructing and evaluating a hypersonic technology demonstrator design matrix. This multi-disciplinary parametric sizing investigation of hypersonic vehicle demonstrators focuses on the evaluation of the combined carrier platform, booster, and hypersonic cruiser solution space topography. Promising baseline configurations are evaluated against operational requirements by trading fuel type, endurance cruise time, and payload weight. The multi-disciplinary study results are constrained with carrier payload mass and geometry limitations. The multi-disciplinary results provide physical insights into near-term hypersonic demonstrator payload and cruise time requirements that will stretch the capability of existing carrier aircraft. Any growth in hypersonic research aircraft size or capability will require new carrier vehicle investments.",Carrier aircraft,2020
An efficient multibody dynamic model of arresting cable systems based on ALE formulation,"Arresting cable systems (ACS) are widely used in aircraft carriers to decelerate an aircraft with high landing velocity in a limited runway length. Considering the complexity of the arresting process, it is extremely challenging to accurately and efficiently predict system dynamic behaviors, such as the arresting distance of aircrafts. In this paper, a comprehensive multibody dynamic model of ACS is proposed, where Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulation is adopted to efficiently simulate the tailhook/pulley-cable moving contact in ACS. In our model, a moving fine mesh of the ALE cable, which tracks the real-time position of the tailhook, is used to accurately capture the contact behaviors between them, while evenly-distributed coarse meshes are used in non-contact areas, thereby greatly reducing DOFs and contact pairs. Additionally, the pulley joint is used to simulate the cable-sheave moving contact, where contact details are completely neglected and the ALE cable node is fixed to the dimensionless sheave point. Finally, the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method are verified through three numerical tests with correlation to the conventional Lagrangian formulation. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

"Hydrogen extraction from a new integrated trigeneration system working with zeotropic mixture, using waste heat of a marine diesel engine","Hydrogen can be used for various applications in ships, but two distinctive places are the combustion processes of the marine diesel engine (MDE) or aircrafts fuelled by aircraft carriers (especially, for long-range transportations applications). For this aim, an integrated trigeneration system working with waste heat of the MDE for mainly hydrogen extraction is proposed here. In addition to hydrogen, the devised trigeneration system can produce surplus electricity and cooling at two different temperature levels. Different zeotropic mixtures are used as working fluid and their performance metrics were compared with each other. It is worthy to say that the simulated basic cooling/electricity system is new and is accounted for as another novelty of the present work. A comprehensive modeling of the proposed trigeneration system is achieved from thermodynamics laws viewpoint and results are elaborated in detail. Based upon the results, the maximum refrigeration load and trigeneration energy efficiency are calculated 166.36 kW and 42.46%, respectively, when R142b/Pentane (0.51/0.49) was used. However, to achieve lower overall exergy destruction, Butene/Isopentane (0.35/0.65) was recommended. Also, the highest trigeneration exergy efficiency is associated with Butene/Isopentane (0.35/0.65) by 18.71%, followed by Isobutene/Isopentane (0.34/0.66) by 18.53%. It is found that the auxiliary vapor generator has the highest exergy destruction by 61.5 kW, followed by ejector by 19.5 kW. At last, an intensive parametric study is also presented to propose some solution for performance enhancement of the system based on the thermodynamics parameters.

The Influence of Sea Power on Politics: Domain- and Platform-Specific Attributes of Material Capabilities,"Students of world politics have long shown a special interest in sea power. International relations, however, tend to treat the means of power as homogeneous and interchangeable. Are military capabilities largely undifferentiated goods, or do specific assets matter for politics? We argue that the characteristics of naval power offer distinctive tradeoffs in terms of the causes of war. Naval presence, firepower, and mobility enable naval nations to fight farther from home and obtain more diplomatic recognition. At the same time, mobility and stealth introduce ambiguity about national priorities and contribute to errors in assessing the local balance of power and resolve. We find empirically that disproportionate investment in sea power is associated not only with heightened diplomatic recognition and power projection across greater distances, as navalists expect, but also with increased instability in the form of a higher risk of dispute initiation. Disaggregating sea power by platform type-battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers-suggests similar tradeoffs across platforms as for navies generally. Sea power enables political leaders to intervene in distant locales, where their interests are more peripheral, and to reconsider their commitments, where their interests do not justify the risk. One counterintuitive implication is that offshore balancing strategies, which rely on sea power for deterrence, may actually be destabilizing.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Analysis of the Influence of the Structural Parameters of Aircraft Braided-Shield Cable on Shielding Effectiveness,"As the more-electric aircraft concept is accepted as the key feature of the next-generation civil aircraft, the onboard electromagnetic environment is getting much worse than traditional models, and consequently the interconnecting cables as the major coupling path of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) are required to provide more sufficient EMI protection ability. Shielded cables have been considered as reliable carriers and widely used in the aircraft for years, but any differences in shielding structure or the number of shielding layers may lead to a significant change in shielding performance. Based on the transmission line theory, this paper builds the crosstalk prediction model for two different shielded cables first, and compare the calculated crosstalk with simulation result to verify the reliability and the effectiveness of the prediction model. Furthermore, the impact of the structural parameters of the cable shield on the shielding performance is studied, such as the number of shielding layer, the thickness of the shielding layer and insulating layer.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Moving Path Following With Prescribed Performance and Its Application on Automatic Carrier Landing,"This article studies the moving path following (MPF) problem where a desired path attached to a moving object must be followed. Focusing on the problem that the classical guidance vector field is not suitable for an MPF, we present a time-varying vector field guidance law, which is qualified for following a path expressed with respect to a moving target frame. Moreover, a prescribed performance method is embedded to the time-varying vector field law to further enhance the control performance. By combining the prescribed performance, the tracking errors are ensured not to exceed the predefined arbitrary small residual sets. Subsequently, the proposed guidance laws are applied to a typical MPF mission-the automatic carrier landing. An active disturbance rejection attitude controller is designed as the ""low-level"" controller with backstepping as the main frame. To eliminate the potential problem of external disturbances and parameter uncertainties, extended state observers are adopted in the controller. Besides, tracking differentiators are integrated with the controller to avoid complex derivative calculations in backstepping. Finally, comparative simulations are conducted, the results clarify and verify the proposed methods.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Detecting Hazardous Spatial Gradients at Satellite Acquisition in GBAS,"In this article, we develop a ground monitor capable of detecting anomalous signal-in-space spatial gradients for rising, newly acquired, and reacquired satellites in the ground-based augmentation system using either single or dual frequency. These gradients can be caused by satellite orbit ephemeris faults and ionospheric fronts. The monitor utilizes differential code and carrier phase measurements across multiple reference receiver antennas as the basis for detection. We show that the new monitor significantly improves performance over existing detection algorithms and is capable of meeting Category III precision approach and landing requirements.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Detection and recognition of a ground moving target under random dynamic conditions,"The infrared radiation characteristic of ground moving targets under random dynamic conditions is an important research hotspot to study for the detection performance of the airborne photoelectric detection system. This paper studies the detection mechanism of the airborne photoelectric detection system to a ground moving target and analyzes the relevant factors that affect the infrared radiation characteristics of ground moving targets. Based on spectral radiation theory, establishes the infrared radiation illumination function of a ground moving target under a complex background environment, combines the rotation relationship matrix between ground moving target and airborne photoelectric detection system, and derives the new calculation model of the signal-to-noise ratio under the Fraunhofer diffraction effect. The experimental results showed that the infrared radiation characteristics of the ground moving target are affected by detection time and photoelectric detector's wavelength, which verifies the spatial position relationship between the ground moving target and the airborne photoelectric detection system also determines the size of the output signal of the photoelectric detector. To effectively improve the infrared radiation characteristics of the ground moving target, the appropriate wavelength of the photoelectric detector changes the flight attitude and velocity of the carrier aircraft, which can improve the infrared radiation characteristics of ground the moving target in the detection process.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Piloted Flight Simulation of Helicopter Recovery to the Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier,"This Paper describes how flight simulation has been used to investigate helicopter recovery operations to the deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth, the United Kingdom's new aircraft carrier. A helicopter flight simulation environment has been developed in which the unsteady airflow over the ship has been created using full-scale computational fluid dynamics. A six-degree-of-freedom motion flight simulator has been used to conduct real-time piloted deck landings where a helicopter flight dynamics model representative of a Sikorsky SH-60B Seahawk helicopter was recovered to the designated rotorcraft landing spots toward the stern of the ship. A test pilot was instructed to land the helicopter and to give workload ratings for the difficulty of the task when flying in relative winds from Ahead, and 45 deg and 90 deg from starboard. The workload ratings, along with the corresponding pilot control activity and helicopter positional accuracy, are discussed in relation to the airflow to which the helicopter was subjected. The Paper demonstrates how flight simulation could be used to support flight trials and helicopter clearance activities but also notes that real-world trials data are needed to compare with the simulations before the techniques can be beneficially deployed.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Nonlinear Asymptotic Attitude Estimation Using Double GPS Receivers and Gyro,"We present an asymptotically convergent nonlinear attitude estimator using a rate gyro and GPS. Double-difference (DD) carrier phase measurements are provided by at least two GPS antennas. The unknown integer ambiguity factor related to GPS carrier phase measurement is estimated along with the attitude. An observability condition is derived to guarantee the convergence of the estimator when a single baseline vector is available with more than four satellites in view. A systematic procedure for tuning observer parameters is also presented. Finally, the experimental test from a light fixed-wing aircraft illustrates the performance of the proposed observer.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Investigation of aerodynamics of separator delivery from cavity,"The ejection test technology is studied in a sub-transonic supersonic wind tunnel using a single cylinder to provide ejection velocity. The angular velocity adjusting device of ejection mechanism is designed, which can adjust the ejection velocity and angular velocity of the model independently. When the ejection cylinder moves downward, the angular velocity adjusting mechanism works at the same time, so that the model has the preset ejection velocity and angular velocity at the moment of leaving the ejection frame. The ejection velocity error is less than 5%, the angular velocity error is less than 10%, and the repetition rate is more than 95%. The new technology has been verified by wind tunnel tests under complex aerodynamic conditions of sub-transonic supersonic and multi-body interference. All parameters have reached or surpassed the existing technical specifications. It has served for model tests many times and met the needs of wind tunnel test research on ejection of embedded weapons in aircraft.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Trajectory Planning and Tracking for Carrier Aircraft-Tractor System Based on Autonomous and Cooperative Movement,"The solution of how to plan out the cooperative moving trajectory autonomously and control the motion of carrier-based aircraft timely and accurately is the key to helping improve the overall deck operation efficiency. The main problem discussed in this article is coordinated trajectory planning strategy for multicarrier aircraft and cooperative control between tractor and carrier aircraft. First, the kinematic model and three-degree-of-freedom dynamics model of the towbarless traction system are established. Then, a coevolution mechanism for aircraft systems is proposed to ensure coordinated trajectory planning among multiple aircraft and a trajectory adapted to the tractor-aircraft system is generated based on the hybrid RRT*algorithm. Next, a double-layer closed-loop controller is designed for the trajectory tracking of the tractor-aircraft system on the deck under the constraints of incomplete constraints and various physical conditions. It includes an outer model predictive controller which effectively controls the cooperative motion between the carrier aircraft and tractor and an inner torque control strategy based on adaptive fuzzy PID control which strictly ensures the stability of the system. Simulation results demonstrate that the controller is more rapid, more accurate, and more robust in tracking line trajectory with initial deviation, sine curve with large curvature, and complex trajectories on decks compared with backstepping control and LQR algorithm.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Design of Air-Wake Rejection Control for Longitudinal Automatic Carrier Landing Cyber-Physical System,"The automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) is an indispensable component of modern air-craft carriers, and it can be considered a special cyber-physical system. However, the disturbance of the carrier air-wake in the final approach is detrimental to the landing safety and complicates the design of the ACLS. An air-wake rejection control strategy can be designed by analyzing the signal flow chart. To suppress the air-wake disturbance, the ACLS in this study is designed based on an adaptive backstepping sliding mode control. This design compensates and restrains the flight performance deviation, and it can also ensure the robustness of the system. Compared with the conventional ACLS design, the capability to restrain the flight performance deviation is significantly enhanced. The simulation results show that the system robustness is improved significantly. Moreover, the proposed design can achieve strict control of the ideal glide slope tracking and realize safe landing under the air conditions of the final approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Drone Launched Short Range Rockets,"A concept of drone launched short range rockets (DLSRR) is presented. A drone or an aircraft rises DLSRR to a release altitude of up to 20 km. At the release altitude, the drone or an aircraft is moving at a velocity of up to 700 m/s and a steep angle of up to 68 degrees to the horizontal. After DLSRRs are released, their motors start firing. DLSRRs use slow burning motors to gain altitude and velocity. At the apogee of their flight, DLSRRs release projectiles which fly to the target and strike it at high impact velocity. The projectiles reach a target at ranges of up to 442 km and impact velocities up to 1.88 km/s. We show that a rocket launched at high altitude and high initial velocity does not need expensive thermal protection to survive ascent. Delivery of munitions to target by DLSRRs should be much less expensive than delivery by a conventional rocket. Even though delivery of munitions by bomber aircraft is even less expensive, a bomber needs to fly close to the target, while a DLSRR carrier releases the rockets from a distance of at least 200 km from the target. All parameters of DLSRRs, and their trajectories are calculated based on theoretical (mechanical and thermodynamical) analysis and on several MatLab programs.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Research on Cooperative Trajectory Planning and Tracking Problem for Multiple Carrier Aircraft on the Deck,"Based on the concepts of the reciprocal velocity obstacle (RVO) and Dubins methods, an improved Dubins-RVO method that can be applied to the scenario with noncircular obstacles is developed. Based on the Dubins-RVO method and one-sided Symplectic Pseudospectral method, a multiaircraft collaborative trajectory planning method was proposed. The kinematic constraint and terminal boundary conditions can be strictly satisfied in the proposed compound trajectory planning method. In addition, a symplectic pseudospectral receding horizon control (RHC) controller is designed to solve the trajectory tracking problem where the constraints on the state and control variables are considered. The proposed compound trajectory planning method is first applied to a two-aircraft problem. The obtained results demonstrate that compared to the RVO and Dubins-RVO methods, the proposed method can effectively avoid the ""dead-lock"" phenomenon and generate feasible trajectory efficiently satisfying all constraints. In addition, simulation experiment for four aircrafts is conducted. Smooth trajectories are obtained. Despite the presence of disturbances in the environment, the trajectories can be tracked with high precision using the symplectic pseudospectral RHC controller.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Multi-constellation ARAIM exploiting satellite motion,"In this work, a new time-sequential positioning and fault detection method is developed for dual-frequency, multi-constellation Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). Unlike conventional ""snapshot"" ARAIM, sequential ARAIM exploits changes in satellite geometry at the cost of slightly higher computation and memory loads. From the perspective of users on Earth, the motion of any given GNSS satellite is small over short time intervals. But the accumulated geometry variations of redundant satellites from multiple GNSS can be substantial. This paper quantifies performance benefits brought by satellite motion to ARAIM. It specifically addresses the following challenges: (a) defining raw GNSS code and carrier error models over time, (b) designing estimators and fault detectors exploiting geometric diversity for positioning, cycle ambiguity estimation, and integrity evaluation, and (c) formulating these algorithms in a computationally efficient implementation. Performance improvements provided by sequential ARAIM over snapshot ARAIM are evaluated by worldwide availability analysis for aircraft approach navigation.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Vigilance Aid Use and Aircraft Carrier Landing Performance in Pilots of Tactical Aircraft,"BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a well-known hazard in aviation. In military fighter communities, policies have evolved to allow for in-flight use of pharmacological vigilance aids to counteract the negative effects of fatigue. With limited objective evidence supporting the role of these medications in continuous flight operations, the present study seeks to evaluate whether use of modafinil is associated with pilot aircraft carrier landing performance.METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was completed following carrier-based flight operations in support of Operation Inherent Resolve. All graded landing passes were included in the analysis. Mixed-effect multivariate linear regression analysis was utilized for the primary outcome of landing signal officer grade of landing performance following combat sorties for events with reported in-flight use of modafinil.RESULTS: A total of 1122 sorties were flown by 79 different pilots with an average landing pass grade of 3.86. The primary outcome of modafinil use in-flight was not generally associated with landing performance. In a subset analysis of more senior ranked aviators, modafinil use appeared to offer a relative performance improvement back to baseline (+0.19). Secondary outcome analysis revealed landing performance was associated with advanced landing technologies (+0.25), sorties later in deployment (+0.05 per 30 d), total career carrier landings (+0.03 per 100 traps), and longer mission duration (-0.04 per hour).DISCUSSION: In the context of evidence supporting subjective benefits of vigilance aid use by aircrew, the results of this study provide ample objective support to the controlled use of modafinil in the operational environment.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Sinking Velocity Impact-Analysis for the Carrier-Based Aircraft Using the Response Surface Method-Based Improved Kriging Algorithm,"The deck landing sinking velocity of carrier-based aircraft is affected by carrier attitude, sea condition, aircraft performance, etc. Its impact analysis is a complex nonlinear problem, and there even is some contradictory phenomenon that when the approach velocity increases, the sinking velocity decreases under certain circumstances. Aiming at exploring the impact of the various related deck landing parameters on sinking velocity for carrier-based aircraft in the actual environment, response surface method-based improved Kriging algorithm (IK-RSM) is proposed based on genetic algorithm and Kriging model. Based on the deck landing measured data of the F/A-18A aircraft in the actual operating environment, the impact degree of the 15 deck landing parameters on the sinking velocity is explored, respectively, by using the partial correlation analysis of multivariate statistical theory and the IK-RSM. It can be found that the 4 parameters are strongly correlated with the sinking velocity; that is, the aircraft glide angle and deck pitch angle are highly correlated with the sinking velocity; next, the approach velocity and the engaging velocity are moderately correlated with the sinking velocity. The 4 parameters above could be used to establish the impact analysis model of the sinking velocity. The genetic algorithm is applied to the correction coefficients optimization of the IK-RSM's kernel functions, and the IK-RSM of the F/A-18A aircraft sinking velocity is formed. Compared with the Kriging model and the empirical formula, the sinking velocity prediction accuracy indexes of IK-RSM are the best; for example, the determination coefficient is 0.981, the mean relative error is 1.813%, and the maximum relative error is 6.771%. Furthermore, based on the sinking velocity IK-RSM and the sensitivity analysis method proposed, we have explained the reason for the contradictory phenomenon that when the approach velocity increases, the sinking velocity decreases at some samples. It could provide certain technical support for the flight attitude control related to the sinking velocity during the actual flight of carrier-based aircraft.",Carrier aircraft,2020
"On the Use of Aeromagnetism for Geological Interpretation: 1. Comparison of Scalar and Vector Magnetometers for Aeromagnetic Surveys and an Equivalent Source Interpolator for Combining, Gridding, and Transforming Fixed Altitude and Draping Data Sets","Airborne magnetic surveys are common in geosciences. High-precision surveys are usually performed at a low altitude, draping the topography, using scalar absolute magnetometers and active compensation systems to correct the disturbances generated by the carrier. Another solution is to measure the total magnetic intensity using vector magnetometers, which allows compensation for aircraft fields to be calculated directly, without compensation systems. This study uses data of an industrial airborne survey and of a vector magnetometer survey with a small overlapping area in the Vosges (France) to compare both data sets and shows that both solutions provide results of the same overall precision. This paper also addresses the issue of combining fixed altitude and draped level data sets as well as topographic effect management by proposing an equivalent source interpolator based on a set of simple dipole sources. A synthetic case shows that the equivalent source interpolator allows to compute grids of the magnetic anomaly as well as potential field transforms from a draped data set with an error level a few orders of magnitude lower than could be obtained with minimum curvature, a classically applied interpolator. The interpolator is also tested on a case study in the Vosges massif of which geological interpretation is presented in Bertrand et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JB017688). The results confirm the observations made on the synthetic case and show that the equivalent source interpolator is more tolerant to navigation errors (altitude) than minimum curvature and allows more rigorous computation of potential field transforms of draped data sets.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Guided Waves for Damage Detection in Complex Composite Structures: The Influence of Omega Stringer and Different Reference Damage Size,"The third dataset dedicated to the Open Guided Waves platform aims at carbon fiber composite plates with an additional omega stringer at constant temperature conditions. The two structures used in this work are representative for real aircraft components. Comprehensive measurements were recorded in order to study (I) the impact of the omega stringer on guided wave propagation, and (II) elliptical reference damages of different sizes located at three separate positions on the structure. Measurements were recorded for narrowband excitation (5-cycle toneburst with varying carrier frequencies) and broadband excitation (using chirp waveforms). The paper presents the results of a technical validation including numerical modelling, and enables further research, for example related to probability of detection (POD) analysis.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Multidisciplinary design and optimization of an innovative nano air launch vehicle with a twin-fuselage UAV as carrier aircraft,"The population of nano satellites has increased dramatically in recent years, but there are few launch vehicles providing dedicated launch opportunities for them. This paper presents the conceptual design of an innovative nano air launch vehicle, dedicated to providing exclusive launch opportunity to nano satellites weighing 10 kg or less. This nano launcher is a three-stage launch vehicle carried by a twin-fuselage unmanned aerial vehicle and released at an altitude of 10 km from a velocity of 0.5Ma. The air launch vehicle is innovative in two senses: firstly, it adopts a novel air launch method. Before separation, the launch vehicle is adjusted to a large angle of attack by the carrier aircraft. The launch vehicle only needs to keep attitude stable after separation, and sequentially when first stage ignites, the orientation of the thrust is inclined upward so that the thrust can provide enough vertical force to pull up the flight path angle rapidly, without aid from large wings; secondly, a terminal lumped control unit is applied to undertake the flight control task on its own. The terminal lumped control unit is a combination of four thrusters that share the liquid propellant with the last stage's main engine. With the terminal lumped control unit, the air launch vehicle needs no movable attitude control instruments, including thrust vectoring gimbals and movable wings. This innovative flight control strategy makes the launch vehicle very simple in structure and light in weight. Multidisciplinary modeling of the nano launcher is performed and genetic algorithm is applied for optimization. Among all the disciplines, trajectory optimization is key in checking the feasibility of the design, for which the Radau pseudospectral method is successfully implemented to obtain the optimal ascent trajectory. The optimal nano launcher has a gross take-off weight of 1365 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to check the robustness of the result using Monte Carlo simulation method.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Lateral autonomous carrier-landing control with high-dimension landing risks consideration,"PurposeThis paper aims to propose a novel model predictive control (MPC) with time varying weights to develop a lateral control law in an automatic carrier landing system (ACLS), which minimizes landing risk and improves flight quality.Design/methodology/approachFirst, a nonlinear mathematic model of an F/A-18 aircraft during lateral landing is established. Then the landing model is linearized in the form of state deviations on the equilibrium points. Second, landing risk windows are proposed and a high-dimensional landing risk model is addressed through a back propagation (BP) neural network. The trained samples are acquired based on a pilot behavior model. Third, time varying weights created from the lateral landing risk are introduced into the performance function of MPC. Optimal solution is solved quicker and some state deviations are focused on and eliminated. Fourth, the algebraic inequalities are substituted by the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are easily calculated by the computers.FindingsOn a semi-physical platform, the proposed method compares with a traditional MPC algorithm and a modified MPC with an additional term. The test results indicate that the proposed algorithm brings about an excellent landing performance as well as an ability of eliminating landing risk.Practical implicationsThe landing phase of a carrier-based aircraft is one of the most dangerous and complicated stages, and the algorithm proposed by this paper plays a vital role in the lateral landing.Originality/valueThis paper establishes a lateral landing risk model, which considers not only the current landing state but also the future touchdown point. This lateral landing risk is integrated into the time varying weights of the MPC algorithm so that the state deviations and landing risk can be both reduced in the rolling optimization.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Landing control design for a VTOL aircraft,"This study investigates the problem of forcing a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft to land on a carrier. Once we obtain the tracking error system, we take the strategies such as preliminarily treating a two-dimensional subsystem, recombining subsystems, separating out a converging term, and using the 'converging input converging state (CICS)' stability theory. As a consequence, we only need to stabilise a fourth-order integrator that is subject to a bounded uncertain coefficient. Then, we assign a partially-saturated controller to deal with the perturbed fourth-order integrator and particularly the uncertain coefficient. With the suggested algorithm, the carrier is allowed to evolve in three dimensions and the landing control design has a simple expression.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Model of the flow on Columnar vortex generator,"Flow control devices are one of the most commonly studied fields of aerodynamic research in the world. This is because improvements in the aerodynamic performance of any vehicle lead directly to save fuel and money and reduce their operational costs. Another reason is that flow control can reduce the risk of aerial vehicles operating near complex structures which can generate high turbulence intensity levels, supposing a risk for its maneuvers. A passive flow control device used for improving the flow on the ramp of an aircraft carrier is the columnar vortex generator (CVG). Using this device, encouraging results to improve the flow for aerial vehicles which operate on those ships, have been obtained. However, CVG detailed working and vortex generation is not fully known. For that reason, the aim of this paper is to present the results obtained in wind tunnel tests of this passive flow control device. The flow behavior at the front, rear and especially inside it, was analysed. A smoke visualization has been made to the CVG model as a first approach to the flow structure surround and inside the CVG. Flow inside the CVG and specifically its vortex generated has been also analysed using velocity maps obtained by particle image velocimetry (PIV). Tangential and axial PIV planes have been obtained to characterise the vortex and its movement inside the device. These resultant velocity maps have been used to compare the vortex with theoretical models (Rankine and Oseen-Lamb vortex) and establish a new model that predicts the velocity profiles of the vortex generated inside the CVG. Finally, new possible applications using the CVG to improve the flow over a building roof and over the flight deck of a frigate under stern wind is tested by means of PIV in the wind tunnel.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Adaptive Super-Twisting Control for Automatic Carrier Landing of Aircraft,"This paper studies the carrier landing control problem for aircraft in presence of model uncertainty, deck motion, and airwake disturbances. An automatic carrier landing system (ACLS) is designed. An adaptive super-twisting control (ASTC) scheme is proposed for a class of nonlinear multivariable system by combining parameter adaptions and sliding mode differentiators, and is applied to ACLS to ensure the tracking precision, rapidity, and robustness of carrier auto-landing. Simulation results show that the ASTC has better performance than the super-twisting control and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Integration Design of Sortie Scheduling for Carrier Aircrafts Based on Hybrid Flexible Flowshop,"Previous studies focused on deck-disposed and trajectory planning problem separately, and there was no systematic study from the whole process. This paper studied sortie scheduling for carrier aircrafts from the perspective of the whole scheduling and dispatch process. According to the process of sortie on flight deck, the sortie task was abstracted into six virtual stages, namely, deck-disposed, taxiing to preparing spot, taxiing from preparing spot to catapult, preparation on the catapult, takeoff, and cooling and recovery for the jet blast deflectors, and, the corresponding machines were also defined, respectively. The constraints were expressed, and the sortie scheduling model was build based on hybrid flexible flowshop scheduling. In addition, the one-sided symplectic pseudospectral method and the proposed collision avoidance strategy based on priority principle were combined to realize the collaborative trajectories planning of taxiing for multiple aircrafts. To obtain the optimal or near optimal solution, the double-layer genetic algorithm was proposed. Finally, the experiments were carried out based on the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier; the sortie task of 8 aircrafts under unknown conditions of deck-disposed and 13 aircrafts with fixed deck-disposed were studied, respectively. Experimental results show that the established model can well describe the sortie of aircraft, and it meets all constraints and actual requirements, which shows that the proposed method and the model can be used for sortie task effectively.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Transmit Power Allocation with Connectivity Probability for Multi-QoS in Cluster Flight Spacecraft Network,"In this paper, we investigate the transmit power allocation problem to minimize the average packet error rate at the access point in the cluster flight spacecraft network, which adopts the CSMA/CA channel access mechanism. First, the node mobility, nodal distance distribution, and probabilistic adjacency matrix were formulated for cluster flight spacecraft network based on twin-satellite mode. Then, the optimization-theoretic model described the optimized transmit power allocation strategy and its implementation algorithm was proposed. And the problem of minimizing the packet error rate of the cluster flight spacecraft network system can be converted into maximizing the expectation of the binary probabilistic adjacency matrix, i.e., maximizing the sum of the nondiagonal elements in the probabilistic adjacency matrix. Due to discreteness of nodal distance distribution, Monte Carlo method was applied to solve the transmit power allocation problem. Yet importantly, the influence of node transmit power on the QoS performance of cluster flight spacecraft network was simulated and analyzed under the assumption of finite overall network transmit power and low traffic load. Finally, the results show that the pocket error rate increases with the provided traffic load, but the pocket error rate hardly changes with the same traffic load in different sequential time slots of any orbital hyperperiod or in the same time slot of different orbital hyperperiods, and by maximizing the sum of the nondiagonal elements in the probabilistic adjacency matrix, the pocket error rate minimum is achieved for a given total network transmit power at any time slot for cluster flight spacecraft network.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Foreign object debris detection method based on fractional Fourier transform for millimeter-wave radar,"Foreign object debris (FOD) denotes any unwanted objects on an airport runway, which must be removed before aircraft take off or land. Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radar is widely utilized to locate small FODs due to its high-range resolution. However, the main difficulty faced by mm-wave radar is to detect stationary little FODs in heavy ground clutter. We propose a layered FOD detection algorithm using clutter map constant false alarm rate (CFAR) and fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) for a mm-wave radar system working at 77 GHz. In the first stage, we utilized the traditional clutter map CFAR to suppress ground clutter while FOD returns and some false alarms were detected using an adaptive threshold. Then, we propose an FrFT-based pattern classification method to distinguish FODs and false alarms, where a two-dimensional feature vector is extracted and a one-class minimax probability machine classifier is trained to accomplish FOD and false alarm classification. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using some measured data obtained via the 77-GHz mm-wave radar.

Optimization and verification of free flight separation similarity law in high-speed wind tunnel,"Based on the similarity of separation time, a similarity law optimization method for high-speed weapon delivery test is derived. The typical separation state under wind load is simulated by the numerical method. The real separation data of aircraft, separation data of previous test methods, separation data of ideal wind tunnel test of previous methods, and simulation data of the proposed optimization method are obtained. A comparison of the data shows that the method proposed can improve the performance of tracking. Similarity law optimization starts with the development of motion equations and dynamic equations in the windless state to address the problems of mismatching between vertical and horizontal displacement, and to address the problems of separation trajectory distortion caused by insufficient gravity acceleration of the scaling model of existing light model. The ejection velocity of the model is taken as a factor/vector, and is adjusted reasonably to compensate the linear displacement insufficiency caused by the insufficient vertical acceleration of the light model method, so as to ensure the matching of the vertical and horizontal displacement of the projectile, and to improve the consistency between the test results of high-speed projection and the actual separation trajectory. The optimized similarity law is applicable to many existing free-throwing modes of high-speed wind tunnels. The optimized similarity law is not affected by the ejection velocity and hanging mode of the projectile. The optimized similarity law is suitable not only for the launching of the buried ammunition compartment and external stores, but also for the test design of projectile launching and gravity separation.

Dynamic Analysis and Security Characteristics of Carrier-Based Aircraft Arresting in Yaw Condition,"In order to research the safety characteristics of carrier-based aircraft in yaw arrest, a complete dynamic model of the arresting system of a certain type of aircraft was developed to understand more about its dynamic properties. Based on the discrete kink-wave model, a simulation of centering arrest was conducted. The simulation results were compared with experimental data from the United States (US) military standards, demonstrating that the basic changing laws are almost the same. On the basis of centering arrest, a simulation of yaw arrest was carried out. The results show that in yaw state, the difference in the lengths of the arresting cables on either side of the hook is smaller in the early stage after the hook hangs on the rope, which leads to little influence on load fluctuation produced by the kink-wave. With the increase in arresting distance, the difference in the lengths of the arresting cables on either side becomes larger, resulting in a situation in which the cable tension on the departure side will gradually become greater than that on the opposite side. In this situation, yaw landing has a negative impact on the characteristics of arresting safety, and the excessive yaw angle causes the aircraft to rush out of the safe landing area.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Evaluation of GBAS flight trials based on BDS and GPS,"Ground-based augmentation systems (GBASs) are widely used augmentation systems using satellite navigation. GBAS can improve the performance of BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) in civil aviation application. Evaluation is necessary before using a GBAS. On the basis of the flight trials conducted at the Dongying airport, evaluation results show that based on both the global positioning system (GPS) L1 signal and BDS B1I signal, ground accuracy designators (GADs) of four reference receivers are consistent with GAD-C levels. The improvement in accuracy obtained with GBAS differential process is similar to 60%, and the differential position error based on the BDS B1I signal is 40% greater than that of the GPS L1 signal, because currently incomplete BDS satellites distribution is worse than that of GPS. Airborne protection levels assessments show that the approach trials based on the BDS B1I signal exhibit several false alarm events. Further analysis indicates that BDS vertical protection levels were larger because of larger pseudoinverse S result from low elevation angle and unsatisfactory geometric distribution of BDS satellites. Besides, monitors show that BDS B1I signal is more affected by ionospheric delay than GPS L1 signal, which can also contribute to false alarm events.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Derivation and validation of wind tunnel free-flight similarity law for store separation from aircraft,"This paper describes a design method for a similarity law for free-flight tests of aircraft load separation. The effect of the initial separation velocity on the motion similarity is considered. For the first time, the initial separation velocity is introduced into the equation of motion to identify similar trajectories. Finally, the model mass parameter characteristics and separation velocity equation are solved to determine similarity laws for wind tunnel tests, greatly improving the accuracy and applicability of test results from wind tunnels. The proposed derivation overcomes the problems faced by the traditional light model method and the traditional heavy model method, namely that they are limited in terms of ejection separation and cannot be realized in wind tunnel tests. The typical separation state under wind load scenarios is simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Separation data from real aircraft and previous test methods are compared with the simulation data obtained by the new similarity law design method. The improvement of the new similarity law in terms of trajectory simulation is verified through a comprehensive data comparison. The data show that the new similarity law greatly improves the accuracy of wind tunnel tests. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Joint Occlusion Detection and Phase Estimation Algorithm for Helicopter Satellite Communication,"In helicopter satellite communication systems, the received signal is blocked by the helicopter rotor blades during propagation, incurring the unstableness of traditional methods of channel estimation due to unknown channel state. To this end, a joint occlusion detection and phase estimation algorithm is proposed by factor graph in this paper. For occlusion detection to acquire channel state, the occlusion channel model is established relying on a Markov chain with a priori blocking ratio, in which the probability distribution of the channel state is calculated by the proposed message-passing algorithm. To obtain the occlusion position and update the blocking ratio, a cross-correlation method is designed. Furthermore, a joint block detection and phase estimation algorithm is developed based on the proposed occlusion detection algorithm to realize phase estimation by iterative receiver, where occlusion detection, phase estimation, and decoding are performed in turn for one turbo iteration and the result of decoding is then sent back to the occlusion detection step for the next iteration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is adaptive to the dynamical change in the blocking ratio and can achieve bit error rate performance that is close to the performance bounds based on perfect channel state.",Carrier aircraft,2020
"Prediction of Point of impact of anti-ship missile - An approach combining target geometic features, circular error probable (CEP) and laser fuze","In attacking a large ship such as an aircraft carrier, if the fuze is able to estimate the point of impact (POI) of the anti-ship missile at the end of the trajectory in real time, combined with the POI to control the different standoff, the damage effect can be effectively improved. Given that the sea surface and the deck have different reflectivity when irradiated by a laser with a wavelength of1.06 mu m, this paper proposes a method for predicting the POI of an anti-ship missile by making use of known typical target geometic features, CEP and laser fuze detection information. Firstly the reflection characteristics of the sea surface and the deck were tested at a wavelength of 1.06 mu m and the experiment proved that the reflectivity of the sea surface and the deck are significantly different. On this basis, the geometric features model of a typical target and the ideal missile-target distance model were established, and the missile-target distance model in consideration of CEP was further derived. Combined with the target geometric features, CEP and the detection information of the four-way laser detection device, Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the prediction of POI of the anti-ship missile. The simulation results show that the method can effectively predict POI of the anti-ship missile. It was also shown that the POI prediction accuracy of the anti-ship missile can be effectively improved by analyzing the detection information of the multiple ballistic experience points of the anti-ship missile, and the uncertainty of POI prediction can be reduced.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Optimization of a columnar vortex generator installed over an aircraft carrier ski-jump ramp,"Aircraft performances over aircraft carriers are essential in modern navies. Take-off operation is critical due to the short runway available. The ski-jump ramp is a useful system that allows to operate under safe conditions. However, the sharp edge at the end of the runway provokes a region with recirculation bubble and low velocity producing strong flow disturbances. Hence, the aircraft performances are affected and the pilot's workload is augmented. Previous researches showed that columnar vortex generator reduces the recirculation bubble generated over the end of flight deck. This article presents an in-depth experimental study performed by wind tunnel testing in order to determine the relation between the columnar vortex generator size and the recirculation bubble reduction. Particle image velocimetry is used to investigate the flow field velocity and flow structure around the ski-jump ramp as a non-intrusive experimental technique. Encouraging results were found for the biggest columnar vortex generator studied.",Carrier aircraft,2020
The Magnitude of the Spatial Disorientation Problem in Transport Airplanes,"INTRODUCTION: Loss-of-control (LOC) is the major cause of transport airplane mishaps. There have been many published reports and papers examining these accidents. While these studies did mention spatial disorientation (SD) as a cause or a factor, none of them analyzed it further. The present study uses transport and commuter airplane mishap data for a recent 35-yr period and examines the results of those mishaps involving spatial disorientation.METHOD: We identified LOC and SD accidents from five national aviation accident organizations and two independent groups. Only ""normal"" operations (air carrier, noncommercial transportation, ferry flights, and training) were considered. We reviewed transport and commuter airplane accidents using the published reports and identified 94 involving SD.RESULTS: We found the distribution of SD mishaps differs from LOC mishaps. During initial climb, there were relatively fewer SD mishaps (16%) than LOC mishaps (31%). During enroute climb SD has relatively more mishaps (18%) than LOC (11%). During go-around or missed approach phases, there were relatively more SD mishaps (21%) than LOC mishaps (4%). Perhaps the most significant observation was an increasing number of SD mishaps during the period reviewed.DISCUSSION: There are several possible reasons for the increasing numbers of SD mishaps over the study period from 1981 to 2016. Somatogravic illusion during go-around or missed approach accounts for only some of this increase. There is insufficient data to determine the reason for the remaining increase.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Integrity risk evaluation of impact of ionospheric anomalies on GAST D GBAS,"This study develops a three-step Monte Carlo method to evaluate the worst possible integrity risk of ionospheric spatial gradients for GAST D GBAS. Impact simulation parameters are classified into two groups, ""worst-case"" and ""average,"" based on the underlying integrity requirements. Unlike ""average"" parameters, ""worst-case"" parameters are those for which a clear basis for averaging could not be established because the probabilistic distribution of these parameters cannot be developed with sufficient confidence due to the lack of observation data. In calculating integrity risk, these ""worst-case"" parameters use the worst-case value that maximizes the integrity risk. Each step of the randomized search narrows down the parameter ranges in sequence and identifies the two worst-case parameter sets (based on the largest position error and the largest missed-detection probability) for each worst-case region identified in the initial step. The resulting integrity risk values are well below 10(-9), showing that the GAST D SARPs integrity requirement is met.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Architecture of the Formally-Verified Distributed Ledger System InnoChain,"In this paper we consider the software architecture of InnoChain, a distributed ledger system (DLS) with 5 levels of formal verification, including a formally-verified underlying operating system (OS). The objective of this architecture is to achieve a higher level of DLS dependability compared to more traditional software architectures and quality assurance (QA) methods. The architecture of InnoChain includes (1) a programming language for smart contracts which is a domain-specific language with formal semantics embedded into CakeML, which is a functional language ofthe ML family; this allows us to carry out formal verification of smart contracts' correctness properties using higher-order logic systems, such as HOL4; (2) trusted compilation of smart contracts into the machine code using the verified compiler available for CakeML, rather than relying on a virtual machine for execution of smart contracts; (3) using CakeML for implementation of InnoChain node functionality which allows for formal verification of code correctness and trusted compilation into the machine code; (4) formal verification of the consensus protocol used InnoChain, namely HotStuff BFT; (5) using seL4, a formally-verified microkernel, as the underlying OS for InnoChain instead of more traditional general-purpose OSes such as Linux. The proposed verified architecture will allow InnoChain to be used in mission-critical applications, such as the decentralized Aircraft Fuelling Control System which is currently under development for JSC Aeroflot, the Russian national air carrier.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Receding Horizon Longitudinal Control Technology for Automatic Carrier Landing With Variable Reference Trajectory Based on Sliding Rate Information,"In this paper, the longitudinal control of automatic carrier landing is studied. First, the carrier landing control problem is transformed into an optimal control problem of trajectory tracking. Considering the constraints of the control variables and the rate of change of control variables in the realistic landing process, the original linear small disturbance model is expanded. Based on the symplectic pseudospectral method and the adaptive regression prediction technology, a fast receding horizon carrier landing control technology with a variable reference trajectory is developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the control algorithm is verified by simulations at different sea states, initial deviations, and reference trajectory selection strategies. The simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of deck motion prediction can greatly reduce the phase delay of the control system and enhance the tracking ability of the carrier-based aircraft and improve the control effectiveness significantly. The proposed algorithm can precisely control the carrier landing trajectory under initial deviations, the external continuous wind disturbances, and random error of the state variables. Additionally, the calculation efficiency of the present control algorithm is sufficient for real-time online tracking.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Studying the Health and Performance of Shipboard Sailors: An Evidence Map.,"INTRODUCTION: It is estimated that sailors who are assigned to surface ships and submarines are deployed for more than 1 year across their careers and they spend 15% to 23% of their time away from home. Research suggests that shipboard sailors experience rates of behavioral health issues similar to those with ground combat experiences. Despite the rigorous operational tempo and the unique shipboard environment experienced by these service members, little military health research has examined the health outcomes of sailors serving aboard ships. The objectives of this study were to develop an evidence map of the peer-reviewed literature to (1) identify potential threats to the health and readiness of shipboard sailors, (2) identify health and performance issues experienced by this population, and (3) identify gaps in the current peer-reviewed published literature on shipboard health and performance.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the existing peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the health, experiences, and performance of shipboard service members was conducted. Comprehensive search terms were used to identify articles published between January 2000 and April 2018. Identified articles were subject to a two-level review process. Study characteristics for all articles selected for final review were extracted, and articles were categorized into 13 content areas that were selected a priori. Findings are presented in an evidence map.RESULTS: The initial literature search yielded 8,858 unique articles, 90 of which were eligible for full review. Most articles primarily examined active duty sailors from the U.S. or other foreign militaries (88.9%). A total of 60 articles (67.8%) included information about the type of ship studied; the most frequently examined were submarines (29.5%) and aircraft carriers (27.9%). Most of the included studies used cross-sectional (63.3%) or longitudinal (24.4%) designs. Only 7.8% (n=7) of articles described interventions. The most commonly examined focal areas included physical health issues, such as viral infections and injuries (56.7%), and health behaviors, such as substance use/misuse (40.0%). Other frequently addressed content areas were occupational stress (38.9%), interpersonal issues (32.2%), ship conditions (30.0%), and mental health (28.9%). Most articles (73.3%) addressed more than one content area. There was a high degree of variation in the measurement tools used; self-report surveys were the most common (48.9%), followed by objective physical, biological, or cognitive measures (32.2%) and medical and personnel record reviews (31.1%).CONCLUSIONS: The evidence map identified various gaps in the research pertaining to the health and performance of shipboard sailors. These gaps included a lack of research on the risk factors for common health and performance issues experienced by sailors and on the relationship between stressors of shipboard life and sailors' health, performance, and readiness. The results of this evidence map should be used to inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve the shipboard environment and/or the preventive health behaviors used by sailors while underway or deployed.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Extension of Quadcopter Flight Range Based on Quadcopter Transport System and Autonomous Ramp Flight Algorithm,"In this study, a new method was developed to extend the flight distance of unmanned aerial vehicles such as quadcopters that operate on a limited battery capacity. The suggested method consists of a high-altitude flight initiation system, which uses a carrier rocket, and an autonomous ramp flight algorithm. First, a quadcopter, called a mission quadcopter in this research, is loaded onto the carrier rocket by a folding mechanism, and the rocket flies to a designated height. Then, the carrier rocket releases the mission quadcopter at the high altitude and achieves flight deployment after an unfolding process. Subsequently, the airdropped mission quadcopter stabilizes its pose and flights toward the selected target point. During the flight, it adopts an autonomous ramp flying trajectory. Ramp flying is performed from the sky to the ground surface instead of conventional step shape flying to minimize the flight trajectory and energy consumed while flying. Experiments were performed in Nevada, USA during an international rocket-based airdrop competition, ARLISS (A Rocket Launch for International Student Satellite). The mission quadcopter's real-time latitude, longitude, and altitude were measured to confirm the position information regarding the quadcopter's flight trajectory. The mission quadcopter successfully separated from the carrier rocket, deployed for flight at a high altitude, turned to the target point, performed autonomous ramp flying, and landed.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Analysis of charts of directional and bi-static scattering of unmanned aerial vehicle linear antenna arrays with reduced radar visibility,"Using the method of induced currents to calculate fields of an object with axial symmetry, an electro-dynamic model was built and analysis of radiation and scattering of electromagnetic waves was carried out by arrays of elementary electric vibrators located on the side surface of an ideal conducting cylinder of finite length. The studies were carried out in the interests of developing methodological bases for the construction of unmanned radio-electronic complexes intended for operation in conditions of protection against radar reconnaissance facilities. Low-profile antenna systems have small weight and size indices and when placed on board slightly change aerodynamic properties and level of secondary carrier field. At the same time their directed properties depend significantly on shape, electric dimensions and electro-physical parameters of surfaces intended for placement. Diffraction of electromagnetic waves on bearing surfaces results in shielding of antenna systems. Effects of change of parameters of spatial-frequency selectivity of transmission-reception of signals, reduction of energy potentials of radio channels, formation of spatial-correlated interference, frequencytime parameters of which are identical to parameters of processed radiation, occur. Linear antenna arrays have significant directional action coefficients and capabilities to control directional patterns due to amplitude-phase correction of current of elements without using complex switching devices. Representation of antenna elements of small electric length by dipoles is possible due to constant values of amplitudes and phases of currents at each point of surface. Side surface of cylinder of resonance electric dimensions can be approximated by fuselage of small-size unmanned aerial vehicle of aircraft type. By selecting values of complex dielectric constant of material from which cylinder is made, reflecting properties of aerial object with reduced radar visibility are reproduced. ^arts of directional and bi-static scattering of antenna arrays are investigated based on asymptotic estimates of total electric field of vibrator system and cylinder in far zone. The polarizing components of the magnetic and electric fields on the side surface of the cylinder were represented by equivalent currents approximated by rows of cylindrical functions; Lattice fields in the far zone of the cylinder were by summing up rows of trigonometric functions of azimuth harmonics of its equivalent currents with weight coefficients. Rows of azimuth harmonics of cylinder side surface currents are characterized by fast convergence when its radius belongs to resonance area. The antenna array performance values were using C++ computer program for a computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 processor with 16 GB RAM. Patterns of change of directed properties of arrays with different number of antenna elements are revealed. Due to the formation of the array field not only by the currents of the antenna elements, but also by the surface currents of the cylinder, its beam patterns and bistatic scattering differ significantly from the characteristics in the free space. A significant difference is evident in the change in the shape of the main beams and the appearance of the side lobes of the diagrams due to the secondary radiation of the bearing surface. The shapes of the linear lattice diagrams in the meridian plane of the cylinder, like those of a single elementary electric vibrator, have petal structures. As the number of antenna elements increases, the width of the array pattern decreases the faster the greater the ratio of inter-element distance to wavelength. Increasing the inter-element distance within the wavelength does not significantly change the directional factor. The narrowing of the bi-static scattering pattern as the wavelength decreases is due to the increasing electromagnetic interaction between the vibrators by increasing the flow density of the secondary field. For an antenna array made of small electric length vibrators, significant directivity indicators can be achieved at a low level of secondary field radiation, which allows to ensure low radar visibility of the unmanned aerial vehicle.",Carrier aircraft,2020
LAYOUT METHOD FOR AIRCRAFT ON THE FLIGHT DECK OF CARRIER USING NO-FIT POLYGON,"The area of the flight deck on the aircraft carrier is limited. To improve the utilization rate of the flight deck and increase the amount of aircraft, the layout of aircraft is discussed. The docking relationship between envelope graphs of carrier aircraft and the determination method of their internal position in deck contour graphs are studied. The above-mentioned problem belongs to the calculation of critical polygons in two-dimensional irregular layout problem. The position of the aircraft is determined by overlapping the centre of gravity of the aircraft with the lowest point on the critical polygon, which is according to the proposed principle of the ""lowest centre of gravity"". The principle and optimization method of the improved simulated annealing (SA) method are studied. The method is studied according to the contact condition between the envelope figures of aircraft, which is used to determine the position of the envelope figure in the deck contour figure. The improved SA method is used to optimize the layout of aircraft graphics in a deck graphic. The simulations show that the improved SA method is better compared with recursive method. The utilization of the deck area is increased by 7.7%.",Carrier aircraft,2020
A New Benchmark for Instance-Level Image Classification,"Although fine-grained image classification is able to classify more fine-grained sub-categories compared to its coarse-grained counterpart, it often fails to identify individual instances. Therefore, we propose a new instance-level image classification task which further refines the granularity of fine-grained classification in order to identify unique instances rather than a sub-category containing multiple instances. In addition, we introduce an instance-level image classification dataset, AircraftCarrier, which contains 20 global aircraft carrier classes, as the first publically available dataset for instance-level image classification. The classification of instance-level aircraft carriers can prove to be a challenging task due to large intra-category differences as well as variations in the camera view, illumination, scale, and the presence of complex backgrounds. The AircraftCarrier dataset put forward here has the potential to improve the development of instance-level image classification. At the same time, we provide a Simple Classification Head (SCH) technique for the classification of aircraft carriers, with classical convolutional neural network models as the backbone network. The SCH has better performance than a direct classification head, and these results provide a benchmark performance result for researchers. Furthermore, we evaluate several fine-grained image classification methods and give their benchmark results. Finally, we present the challenges of instance-level classification and discuss further directions. This study provides the first publicly available instance-level image classification dataset and a performance benchmark for further research.

A Directional Microplasma Thruster Exhibiting a Switchable Intense Plasma Coupling,"Conventional cold and warm gas thrusters with low specific impulses and thrust greatly limit the capability of nanosatellites to conduct meaningful plane and attitude changes in space. This work shows that a novel flexible microplasma thruster (FPT) technology can yield high thrust performance at sufficient specific impulse. The FPT consisting of a seven-jet bundle generated a maximum thrust of 61.9 mN with helium at less than 30 W in ambient atmosphere, and 64.3 mN in vacuum at less than 2 W via jet-to-jet coupling. To further enhance the thrust contributions from both the plasma emission and gas discharge, a novel micro-nozzle was embedded at the end of the glass fiber. The resulting supersonic gas-exhaust velocity from the nozzle increased the thrust output of a single fiber by 300%. This versatile system is a promising microplasma thruster technology suitable for flight demonstration onboard a CubeSat platform, thus changing the nano-satellite paradigm from passive sensor carriers to a fully capable spacecraft.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Study on Delay Propagation Relations Among Airports Based on Transfer Entropy,"To understand the mechanism of delay propagation from the perspective of multiple airports, constructing delay propagation relation (DPR) networks among airports is a novel analysis method. The latest method is to use transfer entropy to mine the delay propagation relation among airports. However, the transfer entropy will produce bias due to estimating high-dimensional conditional mutual information (CMI) in the delay propagation scenario. In this paper, we propose the low-dimensional approximation of CMI for transfer entropy (LTE) to address the above issue. By applying this improved algorithm, the delay propagation relation among airports can be more accurately explored and a more accurate DPR network can be obtained. For this network, we apply the complex network theory and its related indicators to provide systematic analysis about delay propagation. The results of case analysis show that in the delay propagation interactions among airports, large airports always receive delays and small airports propagate delays outward. Meanwhile, delays propagate more efficiently in the aviation system of smaller airlines. These results can provide some theoretical supports for making measures to reduce delay propagation.",Carrier aircraft,2020
An optimization model of parameter matching for aircraft catapult launch,"To efficiently and fully utilize aircraft carrier resources, an optimization model is presented to deal with parameter matching between aircraft and carrier in the process of aircraft catapult launch. Based on carrier aircraft longitudinal dynamic equations and theorem of kinetic energy in catapult launch course, the work characteristics of different forces are learned and a theory model of parameter matching is deduced. In view of the uncertainty of the model parameters of the theory model and the low matching accuracy of the approximate model, an optimization model of parameter matching is introduced in line with the structure of theory model and the approximate model and is generated by the proposed immune genetic algorithm. Compared with the original genetic algorithm and immune algorithm, the proposed algorithm has better calculation accuracy and convergence. The calculation results show that the optimization model occupies certain application value of engineering estimation from the comparison with the relevant literature data and has higher precision than the approximate models. The validity of the proposed approach is verified with numerical case study on a carrier based aircraft. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

The Korean Aircraft Carrier Programme and Implication of the Naval Air Operation during the Korean War,"The aircraft carrier has been regarded as one of the least effective naval weapons in responding the threat from the North Korea, in Korea. Therefore, ROK Navy and it's proponents have been developed their persuasive logics for the carrier acquisition heavily based on the external variables. As a result, this situation has restricted our understanding of the usefulness of the carrier as a ¡®mobile airfield¡¯ in the Korean operational environment. Considering the fact that the aircraft carrier conducted very significant role in the Korean War, it is very interesting that it's usefulness has rarely known in Korea. As the Korean aircraft carrier programme was officially included in the five-year defense blueprint, it is needed to re-examine the forgotten lessons gained from the War.For these purposes, this thesis explores the historical conflict between ¡®the North¡¯s threat¡¯ and the pursuit of the ¡®Ocean-going Navy¡¯. It then examines the usefulness of the carrier by analysing the naval air operation conducted during the early stage of the Korean War. Finally, based on the lessons gained from the War, this thesis seeks to show the ongoing value of the aircraft carrier as a complementary military force of the land-based Air Power.",Carrier aircraft,2020
Research on Dynamic Inertial Estimation Technology for Deck Deformation of Large Ships,"Many kinds of weapon systems and launching equipment on the deck of large ships are easily affected by deck deformation. In order to ensure the accuracy of weapon systems and the safety of taking off and landing of carrier aircraft, a dynamic estimation method combining the main inertial navigation systems (INS) and the sub-inertial navigation systems (SINS) is designed to estimate the curvature and torsion of any trajectory on the deck. Our contributions start from the fact that the area of concern extends from the fixed points to any trajectory on the deck. The dynamic filter algorithm of wavelet combined with Kalman filter is used to process the acquired data. The wavelet method is used to remove the outliers in the acquired data, and the Kalman filter effectively reduces the influence of white noise, so that the estimation accuracy is guaranteed. The simulation results clearly show that the deck deformation of large ships can be obtained accurately in real-time over the observed area which proved that this dynamic inertial measurement method is feasible in practical engineering application.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Launch Bar Dynamics Character Analysis of Carrier-Based Aircraft Catapult Launch,"The launch bar is a unique device of carrier-based aircraft, which is connected to the nose gear and shuttle. In order to avoid the launch bar striking the flight deck after the launch bar pops out of the shuttle, it is very important to research the dynamics performance of the launch bar. This paper establishes a staged mathematical model of catapult launch including the launch bar, a steam-powered catapult, a holdback bar, and a carrier-based aircraft. This article studied the effect of the mass of the launch bar, restoring moment of the launch bar, and center of gravity position of the launch bar on the dynamics performance of the launch bar. The results showed the following: (1) we could reduce the risk collision of the launch bar and deck by reducing the mass of the launch bar, increasing the restoring moment, and shifting the center of gravity position of the launch bar; (2) under the working condition of this article, we changed the center of gravity position of the launch bar to control the sink of the launch bar end, having the most obvious effect, and we reduced the mass of the launch bar, having the least effect on controlling the sink of the launch bar end; however, reducing the mass of the launch bar could also greatly reduce the risk collision of the launch bar and deck; (3) in order to avoid the launch bar striking the flight deck, the restoring moment of the launch bar must overcome the sum of other moments. The study results can give a theoretical reference for designing and testing the launch bars of carrier-based aircraft. It can also give a theoretical reference for designing and testing the launch bar's driving mechanisms.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Intelligent Power Compensation System Based on Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Using Soft Computing and Automation,"The approach power compensator system (APCS) plays a role in the automatic carrier landing system (ACLS), and the performance of the APCS is affected by the carrier air-wake in the final-approach. In this paper, the importance of the APCS is verified through the analysis of the signal flow chart of the ACLS. Hence, it is necessary to suppress the carrier air-wake in order to improve the anti-interference ability. The adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) not only has better dynamic tracking performance compared to the nonlinear mode, but also can efficiently resist the disturbance caused by the carrier air-wake. The design of the longitudinal control law of the ACLS is based on the carrier-based aircraft nonlinear model and the carrier air-wake model. It comprises the longitudinal guidance rate, autopilot (CAS) and the APCS. The ASMC is used to design the APCS to suppress the carrier air-wake. A comparison of the simulation results indicates that the design based on the ASMC has better anti-interference ability and can keep the velocity constant on the timely.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Ablative Properties of C/C-SiC Composite in the Wake Flow Field of Carrier-based Aircraft,"In order to improve the working performance of the gas deflector of aircraft carrier, the ablation test intended for simulating the takeoff condition was conducted by placing the test specimens of C/C-SiC composite in the wake flow of carrier-based aircraft so as to measure the ablative rate of the specimens. The microstructure of the test specimens after ablation was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and micro-CT, the components of combustion products were measured by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and the ablation mechanism and thermal shock damage of the test specimens were analyzed. The results show that the linear ablative rate of the test specimen is about 0.0405 mm/s and the mass ablative rate is about 0.0349 g/s. The heat-affected zone experiences matrix cracking, and the oxidation reaction is not obvious. In the transition zone, the SiO2 produced by the reaction is precipitated around the carbon fibers and forms a sheathing structure, thus effectively retarding oxidation reaction from transferring inward and reducing the ablative rate of the test specimen. In the center of ablation, the retardation of SiC on oxidation reaction is slight and the test specimen forms a concave pit, with carbon fibers being distributed in the shape of pointed bamboo shoots. On the whole, the material gives its outstanding anti-ablative performance.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Multi-body coupling dynamic research of carrier-based aircraft catapult launch based on natural coordinate method,"There is an increasing demand for predicting the dynamic behaviours of carrier-based aircrafts(CBAs) during catapult launch. This paper presents a maximal parameterised dynamic model of the launch process from a new perspective, and conducts a detailed study of its mechanical behaviours. Based on the topological analysis of the multi-body catapult launch system, the natural coordinate method is adopted to establish a comprehensive model including steam catapult, landing gears, ship motion, aerodynamic and multi-body modules. The predictive capability of the model is demonstrated by presenting the CBA launch dynamic properties under different conditions. First, effects of steam flow area rate and the coupling carrier movement in different directions on catapult performance are discussed. Second, the take-off characteristics as well as the initial catapult attitude are analysed. Then, by investigating Lagrange multipliers, the loads of torque arms, holdback bar and launch bar are compared. Finally, the loads of buffer struts and tyres during launch are also discussed. The results show that it is reasonable to keep the steam flow area increasing in a linear way, but the opening velocity needs to be strictly controlled. When the CBA departs from the deck, the possible sink of the bow is the major threat to the take-off safety, the larger the sink is, the more dangerous the flight becomes. The upwash at the bow may be the primary reason of stall and cannot be ignored. The model established is reliable with capacities of capturing the coupled behaviours between different sub-modules as well as the load change of each component in detail. The natural coordinate method proves to be efficient and accurate, which should be given more attention.",Carrier aircraft,2019
y Linear random search and engineering estimation of sinkage for launching carrier aircraft,"A linear random search algorithm (LRSA) is developed to determine the critical value of takeoff weight limited to the safe flight track sinkage and an engineering estimation method (EEM) is proposed to calculate the sinkage of carrier aircraft launch in real time. Based on the analysis of free flight after leaving the carrier, the equations are established to participate into engineering estimation of flight track sinkage. Thanks to the proposed search algorithm, the maximum takeoff weight of carrier aircraft with safe catapult launch flight track sinkage is generated in few steps. The results of sinkage estimation and the search algorithm are in good agreement with that of aircraft catapult launch simulation. The main contribution of this manuscript is the establishment of simple and accurate engineering estimation for carrier aircraft launch flight track sinkage and the development of robust and efficient search algorithm for the critical value with safe catapult criteria.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Flight control and airwake suppression algorithm for carrier landing based on model predictive control,"Carrier airwake will cause aircraft landing trajectory deviation from the reference glide path during the final precision approach and landing stage, hence exacerbating the operation load of pilots and increasing the risk of carrier landing. To address this issue, a flight control algorithm that employed state space model predictive control (MPC) to suppress the effect of airwake was presented for aircraft landing on the carrier in this article. The MPC controller was built on the basis of the small-disturbance motion equation of a carrier-based aircraft under the landing status. Meanwhile, in particular, the airwake model was introduced in MPC controller so that its influence could be mitigated promptly. The computer simulation experiments demonstrated that the proposed method could effectively reduce the trajectory deviation caused by airwake and improve the success rate of carrier landing.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Exploring mission planning method for a team of carrier aircraft launching,"High-level efficiency and safety are of great significance for improving the fighting capability of an aircraft carrier. One way to enhance efficiency and safety level is to organize the carrier aircraft into combat effectively. This paper studies the mission planning problem for a team of carrier aircraft launching, and a novel distributed mission planning architecture is proposed. The architecture is hierarchical and is comprised of four levels, namely, the input level, the coordination level, the path planning level and the execution level. Realistic constraints in each level of the distributed architecture, such as the vortex flow effect, the crowd effect and the motion of aircraft, are considered in the model. To solve this problem, a distributed path planning algorithm based on the asynchronous planning strategy is developed. The proposed Mission Planning Approach for Carrier Aircraft Launching (MPACAL) is validated using the setups of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. Compared to the isolated planning architecture and the centralized planning architecture, the proposed distributed planning architecture has advantages in coordinating the launch tasks not only belonging to the same catapult but also when all different catapults are considered. The proposed MPACAL provides a modeling method for the flight deck operation on aircraft carrier. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

A general trajectory optimization method for aircraft taxiing on flight deck of carrier,"Enhancing operation efficiency of flight deck has become a hotspot because it has an important impact on the fighting capacity of the carrier-aircraft system. To improve the operation efficiency, aircraft need taxi to the destination on deck with the optimal trajectory. In this paper, a general method is proposed to solve the trajectory optimization problem for aircraft taxiing on flight deck considering that the existing methods can only deal with the problem in some specific cases. Firstly, the ground motion model of aircraft, the collision detection strategy and the constraints are included in the mathematical model. Then the principles of the chicken swarm optimization algorithm and the generality of the proposed method are explained. In the trajectory optimization algorithm, several strategies, i.e. generation of collocation points, transformation of control variable, and setting of segmented fitness function, are developed to meet the terminal constraints easier and make the search efficient. Three groups of experiments with different environments are conducted. Aircraft with different initial states can reach the targets with the minimum taxiing time, and the taxiing trajectories meet all the constraints. The reason why the general trajectory optimization method is validated in all kinds of situations is also explained.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Longitudinal automatic carrier landing system guidance law using model predictive control with an additional landing risk term,"This paper used a model predictive control with an additional term to develop a modified longitudinal guidance law to reduce landing risk in an automatic carrier landing system. The landing risk model was established by using a longitudinal trajectory and touchdown point predictive principle. A traditional MPC was then involved in designing a modified automatic carrier landing system guidance law for the proposed model. The nonlinear landing mathematic model of an F/A-18 carrier-based aircraft was initially established. Considering the processed procedure in the model predictive control algorithm, the corresponding linear landing model was derived on the basis of the equilibrium states of the F/A-18. Second, landing trajectory in the longitudinal plane was analysed so that the predictive principle of the trajectory trend was reasonably addressed. Depending on the experimental sample data of a pilot model, some linear imitating envelopes are transformed from the corresponding nonlinear trajectory clusters. Furthermore, a touchdown point prediction model was further established based on the predicted trajectory and touchdown point. Third, the traditional model predictive control was introduced to integrate the landing risk term in the performance cost function to develop a novel modified algorithm that not only guides the aircraft to automatically approach and land on the carrier, but also eliminates landing risk during the final carrier approach. Linear matrix inequalities were imported to substitute algebraic inequalities derived from this new algorithm to increase calculating speed. A simulation mission was conducted on a semi-physical platform and compared with the traditional model predictive control without the additional term. The theoretical results validated the correctness and robustness of the modified algorithm and its capability to eliminate landing risk during terminal carrier approach.",Carrier aircraft,2019
The effect analysis of an engine jet on an aircraft blast deflector,"This paper establishes a novel mathematical model for computing the plume flow field of a carrier-based aircraft engine. Its objective is to study the impact of jet exhaust gases with high temperature, high speed and high pressure on the jet blast deflector. The working condition of the nozzle of a fully powered on engine is first determined. The flow field of the exhaust jet is then numerically simulated at different deflection angle using the three-dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and the standard - epsilon turbulence method. Moreover, infra-red temperature tests are further carried out to test the temperature field when the jet blast deflector is at the 45 degrees deflection angle. The comparison between the simulation results and the experimental results show that the proposed computation model can perfectly describe the system. There is only 8-10% variation between them. A good verification is achieved. Moreover, the experimental results show that the jet blast deflector plays an outstanding role in driving the high-temperature exhaust gases. It is found that 45 degrees may be the best deflection angle to protect the deck and the surrounding equipment effectively. These data results provide a valuable basis for the design and layout optimization of the jet blast deflector and deck.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Multi-Parameter Optimization for the Wet Steam Accumulator of a Steam-Powered Catapult,"Selecting the optimal parameters for wet steam accumulator of steam-powered catapult is an important task, due to launching safety. There is no literature on the topic of the parameters optimization for wet steam accumulator of steam-powered catapult. The genetic algorithm (GA) was used to determine the optimal wet steam accumulator in this article. The sink-off-the-bow (SOB), angle of attack and rate of climb were used to create the objective function. The multi-objective optimization can be converted to single-objective optimization, which is subject to angle of attack and rate of climb. Moreover, the simulation model of the steam catapult system was built by creating a thermodynamics model of steam-powered catapult, a mathematical model of traction release device, a statics model of tensioning, a statics model of full takeoff power, a mathematical model of catapult force build-up with holdback, a model of release, a dynamics model of power stroke, a dynamics model of free deck run and a dynamics model of fly away. Finally, the optimal combination of the wet steam accumulator was obtained via numerical simulation. The GA method can effectively find the optimal parameters of wet steam accumulator, and its optimized parameters can increase the safety of catapult launch process.",Carrier aircraft,2019

Firstly, the adaptive sliding mode control method is used to suppress the disturbance of carrier air-wake. Next, the dynamic recurrent fuzzy neural network is applied to compensate the system failure, which further ensures the accurate tracking of ideal glide slop for the carrier-based aircraft. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm is verified by simulation results. Compared with the normal control system of the ACLS, this design can obviously improve the stability of the system and has a good restraint effect on the disturbance of the carrier air-wake.",Carrier aircraft,2019
Deck motion prediction in development of stabilization law for optical landing aid system of carrier aircraft,"Object and purpose of research. This paper studies optical landing aid system of carrier airplanes and its control law. The purpose of this work is to develop control & stabilization law for the optical landing aid system to ensure smoother touchdown and, accordingly, safer landing of airplane on a moving carrier deck. This control & stabilization law is based on prediction algorithms for ship motions at the moment of touchdown. These algorithms must be applicable directly in the process of a real aircraft landing onto carrier deck. Materials and methods. Motion predictions are obtained through regressive analysis of time series, a common tool of random-process theory. Applicability of prediction algorithms is estimated by simulation (at TsAGI PS-10M flight simulator) of carrier aircraft landing assisted by the optical aids. Main results. This paper suggests a control law for optical landing assistance tools of carrier aircraft that predicts deck position at the moment of touchdown while the aircraft descends along a pre-set path.

Trajectory planning and tracking control for towed carrier aircraft system,"As an efficient and safe dispatching scheme is of great importance to ensure the effectiveness and safety of personnel on the Aircraft Carrier, and the towed aircraft system without bar is a common means of dispatching, the dispatching of the system is a significance and interesting question. In this paper, the towed carrier aircraft system without bar is transformed into a tractor-trailer system, and the nonlinear motion constraint is proposed. In order to improve the efficiency and safety of dispatching, the trajectory-planning and tracking of the system are studied, respectively. Obstacles in the environment and the nonlinear motion constraints are taken into consideration, the trajectory-planning is transformed into the optimal control problem, and combined with the symplecticity and pseudospectral method, an offline optimal control algorithm with high efficiency is proposed firstly.

Finally, the offline trajectory-planning algorithm has been proved by simulation experiment, it shows that the algorithm has high computational efficiency and good applicability. And the system can track the standard trajectory, even though there are disturbances in the environment, with high precision using the online tracking method, the calculation efficiency is also verified, and real-time tracking can be achieved.

"Modeling, control design, and influence analysis of catapult-assisted take-off process for carrier-based aircrafts","This paper addresses the problems of modeling, control design, and influence analysis of the steam catapult-assisted take-off process of the carrier-based aircrafts. The mathematical models of the carrier-based aircraft, steam catapult, landing gears, and the environmental factors including deck motion and bow airflow have been established to express the aircraft dynamics in the take-off process. An engineering method based automatic flight control system has been designed, which is divided into the longitudinal channel and lateral channel. The influences of the preset control surface, ship deck motion, ship bow airflow, and automatic flight control system system are tested by a series of simulations. The simulation results show that the elevator angle preset is necessary in the stage of accelerated running on the ship deck and the deck motion is the most important factor for safe take-off, while the ship bow airflow is beneficial for climbing up of the aircraft. The automatic flight control system gives the guarantee of safety and performance in the take-off process of the carrier-based aircraft.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Path Planning for Aircraft Fleet Launching on the Flight Deck of Carriers,"This paper studies the path planning problem for aircraft fleet taxiing on the flight deck of carriers, which is of great significance for improving the safety and efficiency level of launching. As there are various defects of manual command in the flight deck operation of carriers, the establishment of an automatic path planner for aircraft fleets is imperative. The requirements of launching, the particularities of the flight deck environment, the way of launch, and the work mode of catapult were analyzed. On this basis, a mathematical model was established which contains the constraints of maneuverability and the work mode of catapults; the ground motion and collision detection of aircraft are also taken into account. In the design of path planning algorithm, path tracking was combined with path planning, and the strategy of rolling optimization was applied to get the actual taxi path of each aircraft. Taking the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier as an example, the taxi paths of aircraft fleet launching was planned with the proposed method. This research can guarantee that the aircraft fleet complete launching missions safely with reasonable taxi paths.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Aerial Wide-Area Motion Imagery Registration Using Automated Multiscale Feature Selection,"Automatic registration of aerial wide-area motion imagery is required to correct the camera parameters in order to eliminate the geocoding errors arising from frequent reinstallation of the camera array on the carrier aircraft. Approaches developed to date solely rely on the information present in the imagery not using a priori knowledge about the environment and the features present in it in the sequence analysis. To this end, we propose a novel method based on dynamic feature extraction and automatic multiscale feature matching to produce per-frame camera pose corrections. The features are extracted from the imagery using one of the three dedicated classifiers and are then robustly matched to the features projected from the datum using a coarse-to-fine multiscale approach. Finally, the bias between the estimated and the actual camera pose is estimated using ordinary least squares optimization performed on the distances between the approved match candidate pairs. The application of the proposed method to 50 frames of very high-resolution aerial imagery captured over mixed terrain at an altitude of 5.3 km demonstrates significant reduction in position error of the features (from 47.76 to 12.31 m) and proves the attractiveness of the approach as an alternative to manual labeling methods using ground control points.",Carrier aircraft,2018
A Dynamic Scheduling Method for Carrier Aircraft Support Operation under Uncertain Conditions Based on Rolling Horizon Strategy,"D The efficient scheduling of carrier aircraft support operations in the flight deck is important for battle performances. The supporting operations and maintenance processes involve multiple support resources, complex scheduling process, and multiple constraints; the efficient coordination of these processes can be considered a multi-resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (MRCMPSP), which is a complex non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem. The renewable resources include the operational crews, resource stations, and operational spaces, and the non-renewable resources include oil, gas, weapons, and electric power. An integer programming mathematical model is established to solve this problem. A periodic and event-driven rolling horizon (RH) scheduling strategy inspired by the RH optimization method from predictive control technology is presented for the dynamic scheduling environment. The periodic horizon scheduling strategy can track the changes of the carrier aircraft supporting system, and the improved event-driven mechanism can avoid unnecessary scheduling with effective resource allocation under uncertain conditions. The dual population genetic algorithm (DPGA) is designed to solve the large-scale scheduling problem. The activity list encoding method is proposed, and a new adaptive crossover and mutation strategy is designed to improve the global exploration ability. The double schedule for leftward and rightward populations is integrated into the genetic process of alternating iterations to improve the convergence speed and decrease the computation amount. The computational results show that our approach is effective at solving the scheduling problem in the dynamic environment, as well as making better decisions regarding disruption on a real-time basis.",Carrier aircraft,2018
A Fuzzy Path Selection Strategy for Aircraft Landing on a Carrier,"Landing is one of the most dangerous tasks in all the operations on an aircraft carrier, and the landing safety is very important to the pilot and the flight deck operation. Nowadays, the landing safety of carrier aircraft is improved by designing an automatic landing controller and by training the pilot to increase his/her control ability. However, the importance of choosing the landing path has not been investigated thus far. In this paper, the problem of landing path selection for an aircraft carrier is studied as there are several candidates corresponding to different situations. A fuzzy path selection strategy is proposed to solve the problem considering the fuzziness of environmental information and human judgment, and the goal is to provide the pilot with a more reasonable decision. The strategy is in view of the idea of Fuzzy Multi-attribute Group Decision Making (FMAGDM), which has been widely used in industry. Firstly, the background of the landing path selection is given. Then, the factors influencing the decision making are abstracted to build the conceptual model. A TOPSIS-based group decision-making method is developed to denote the preference of each decision maker for each alternative route, and the optimal landing path under the current environment is determined taking into account the knowledge and the weight of both the pilot and the landing console operator (LCO). Experimental studies under different setups, i.e., different environments, are carried out. The results demonstrate that the proposed path selection strategy is validated in different environments, and the optimal landing paths corresponding to different environments can be determined.",Carrier aircraft,2018
A Robust Scheduling Optimization Method for Flight Deck Operations of Aircraft Carrier With Ternary Interval Durations,"The sortie and recovery operations of the carrier-based aircraft fleet are carried out in a cyclic mode, and there are uncertainties during the flight deck operations, which is the main factor that influences the sustainability of cyclic operations. The robust scheduling problem for flight deck operations (RSPFDO) with uncertain duration is studied in this paper. First, the robust scheduling model of flight deck operations with ternary interval durations is established. In this model, the precedence and resource constraints including personnel, equipment, workstation space, and supply resource are taken into account, and the uncertain duration is modeled as a ternary interval number. Second, to make a proactive plan, serial schedule generation scheme is used to generate baseline schedules, and a robust personnel allocation scheme is designed. In terms of executing schedules, a pre-constrained scheduling policy is proposed to evaluate the ternary interval of makespan. Third, a double-population and self-adaptive differential evolution (DSDE) algorithm is presented to optimize the robust plan, which is embedded in a population-based double justification scheme, self-adaptive selection of mutation and crossover factors, and a chaotic catastrophe operator based on the scouts mode of artificial bee colony algorithm. The validity of the established model and the superiority of the DSDE algorithm are verified by simulations with mission cases and algorithm comparison. The results demonstrate that the proposed robust scheduling method can effectively improve the robustness of the flight deck operations.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Evaluation for Sortie Generation Capacity of the Carrier Aircraft Based on the Variable Structure RBF Neural Network with the Fast Learning Rate,"The neural network has the advantages of self-learning, self-adaptation, and fault tolerance. It can establish a qualitative and quantitative evaluation model which is closer to human thought patterns. However, the structure and the convergence rate of the radial basis function (RBF) neural network need to be improved. This paper proposes a new variable structure radial basis function (VS-RBF) with a fast learning rate, in order to solve the problem of structural optimization design and parameter learning algorithm for the radial basis function neural network. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is adjusted by calculating the output information of neurons in the hidden layer and the multi-information between neurons in the hidden layer and output layer. This method effectively solves the problem that the RBF neural network structure is too large or too small. The convergence rate of the RBF neural network is improved by using the robust regression algorithm and the fast learning rate algorithm. At the same time, the convergence analysis of the VS-RBF neural network is given to ensure the stability of the RBF neural network. Compared with other self-organizing RBF neural networks (self-organizing RBF (SORBF) and rough RBF neural networks (RS-RBF)), VS-RBF has a more compact structure, faster dynamic response speed, and better generalization ability. The simulations of approximating a typical nonlinear function, identifying UCI datasets, and evaluating sortie generation capacity of an carrier aircraft show the effectiveness of VS-RBF.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Multi-role carrier-based airplane,"Object and purpose of research. In the XXIst century, aircraft becomes more and more expensive to develop and operate, so the task of making it capable of performing a wide spectrum of functions is becoming more and more relevant. This paper discusses one of possible ways to develop a multi-role airplane. Materials and methods. The progress in computers and electric remote control technologies made it possible to make aircraft modular. Modular airplanes are sure to be the most welcome in carrier-based aviation. This paper gives tentative calculations of key parameters for a modular airplane, based on fundamental provisions of strength theory and aviation theory (Breguet formula). Main results. This paper suggests one of possible efficient configurations of a carrier-based airplane. The main drawback of modular aircraft is that their airframes are too heavy, as compared to conventional one. For a modular airplane with takeoff weight of ~30 t this excessive weight would be approximately 880 kg, resulting in somewhat lower performance parameters, e.g. maximum range 10% shorter. On the other hand, enhanced flexibility offered by modular airplanes paves way to a whole new level in aircraft upgrade and operation capabilities. Conclusion. Availability of modular carrier-based aircraft will significantly reduce technological risks in development of Russian multi-role aircraft carriers, making it possible to do without a catapult, as well as to improve size and weight of ships, simultaneously widening the spectrum of their possible applications.",Carrier aircraft,2018
Analysis of Global Sensitivity of Landing Variables on Landing Loads and Extreme Values of the Loads in Carrier-Based Aircrafts,"When a carrier-based aircraft is in arrested landing on deck, the impact loads on landing gears and airframe are closely related to landing states. The distribution and extreme values of the landing loads obtained during life-cycle analysis provide an important basis for buffering parameter design and fatigue design. In this paper, the effect of the multivariate distribution was studied based on military standards and guides. By establishment of a virtual prototype, the extended Fourier amplitude sensitivity test the main influencing factors on the landing gear's course load and vertical load; sinking speed, rolling angle, and yawing angle are the main influencing factors on the landing gear's lateral load; and sinking speed is the main influencing factor on the barycenter overload. The extreme values of loads show that the typical condition design in the structural strength analysis is safe. The maximum difference value of the vertical load of the main landing gear is 12.0%.

A Prediction Method for Deck Motion of Aircraft Carrier Based on Particle Swarm Optimization and Kernel Extreme Learning Machine,"The prediction of deck motion is an effective and potential means of improving the landing/take-off safety of carrier-based aircraft using current and historical deck-motion measurements when deck motion in six degrees of freedom cannot be effectively controlled or restrained. The prediction models of deck motion should have excellent nonlinear fitting ability to cope with the deck-motion characteristics of randomness and nonlinearity caused by waves and wind; and should not use heavy computation to fulfill the requirement of real-time prediction for deck motion. It is generally believed that classical feed-forward neural networks, such as the back-propagation (BP) network, have excellent nonlinear fitting ability but suffer from slow training processes and reduced local optimum, thus failing to satisfy the requirements of real-time and high accuracy for deck-motion prediction. In addition, the extreme learning machine (ELM) is easy to train but it is difficult for ELM to determine the number of hidden layer nodes; an incorrect number of hidden layer nodes will introduce poor stability and generalization ability. To fulfill the requirements of deck motion prediction, a prediction method based on ELM, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization [particle swam optimization kernel extreme learning machine (PSO-KELM)] is designed. In this method, the fundamental structure of the ELM is used and the kernel function from the support vector machine (SVM) is introduced to replace the hidden function in ELM. Further aiming at the acquisition of optimal parameters, including the penalty coefficient and kernel parameters for the kernel function, autoadaptive particle swarm optimization is adopted. Simulation results indicate that a prediction method based on PSO-KELM has the advantages of a simple structure, fast training speed, and powerful generalization ability, and thus can satisfy the requirements of real-time and high-accuracy deck-motion prediction. Compared with the prediction data from BP and the ELM, high-precision prediction data can be obtained with PSO-KELM. PSO-KELM has a significantly reduced training time compared with BP.",Carrier aircraft,2017
Status analysis and forecast of operated aircraft writing-off,"Monitoring of the current state of the aircraft fleet is an essential component of the management process of the aircraft fleet renewal by introduction of new types of aircraft with improved technical and economic characteristics. The branch (Federal Air Transport Agency - Rosaviatsya) does not supervise (keeps record) on such deals as purchase and leasing of foreign made aircraft operated in Russian Federation. We mean the monitoring with respect to concrete transaction number, the date of leasing commencement and its expiration. In this connection, the problem of such aircraft retirement from the Russian air transportation market is difficultly formalizable. This analysis was based on publicly available databases Flightglobal (http://dashboard.flightglobal.com/app/fleet/#/analyser/fleet), contract data and published reports on big deals of the companies. For the purposes of the analysis the operated aircraft was separated into several groups according to ownership types and aircraft age. These groups are as follows: the aircraft owned by air carrier; aircraft obtained by financial leasing (from which the author separated out the subgroups of ¡°young¡± aircraft, the aircraft with life span lower than 12 years, and the aircraft with life span more than 12 years); the aircraft in back leasing and operational leasing. The owned aircraft retirement was determined according to the expected life span, or maximum permissible flying hours and endurance cycles from the commencement of operation. The retirement of an aircraft being in financial leasing or leaseback can be forecasted only by life the span and total operating time. Meanwhile the economic mechanism of the transition of the second-hand aircraft from the big companies to regional Russian companies is not developed.

Energy management-based design of a Wankel hybrid-electric UAV,"Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the optimization of design and energy management in a parallel hybrid-electric powertrain to replace the conventional engine of an existing tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a Wankel engine with a pre-defined flight mission. The proposed powertrain can work in four different operating modes: electric, thermal, power-assist and charging. Design/methodology/approach The power request at propeller axis of each flight segment is used as input for an in-house model that calculates the overall fuel consumption throughout the mission (Mfuel) and the maximum payload weight (Wpay) by means of an average-point analysis. These outputs depend on the energy management strategy that is expressed by the power-split ratio between engine and electric phase (Uphase) of each mission phase, according to which the components of the hybrid system are sized. The in-house model is integrated into an optimization framework to find the optimal set of Uphase and battery size that minimizes Mfuel and maximizes Wpay. Findings It was found a 3.24% saving of the fuel mass burned throughout the mission (or, alternative an improvement of endurance by 4.3%) with about the same maximum-payload mass (+0.2%) of the original configuration, or a smaller fuel saving with +11% more payload. The fuel saving of 3.24% corresponds to -3.25% in total emissions of CO2 and a 2.34% reduction of the cost-per-mission. Practical implications - This study demonstrates that environmental advantages, even if limited, can be already obtained from optimal design and management of the hybrid power system with today technologies while waiting for further benefits from the introduction of advanced technologies for batteries and electric machines. Originality/value The main novelties are the design of the powertrain on the basis of the energy management and the application of scalability and hybridization to Wankel engines.",Drone,2019

The bio-inspired discrete wing structure, controlled by a morphing skeleton structure, can actively morph into different swept-wing configurations similar to the wing postures of the pigeon and maintain a discrete wing surface similar to the pigeon wing surface at the same time. The results reveal that the bio-inspired morphing UAV can always maintain an optimal lift-to-drag ratio at three different Reynolds numbers utilizing the symmetrical wing morphing. The asymmetrical wing morphing can well achieve rolling control of the UAV. Furthermore, compared with a continuous wing surface structure, the bio-inspired discrete wing surface structure not only can achieve the induced drag reduction of the UAV through effectively decreasing the wing-tip vortex strength but also improve the lateral stability of the UAV.

Multi-objective optimisation of semi-closed cycle engines for,"The maximum attainable performance of small gas turbines represents a strong limitation to the operating altitude and endurance of high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Significant improvement of the cycle thermal efficiency can be achieved through the introduction of heat exchangers, with the consequent increase of the overall engine weight. Since semi-closed cycle engines can achieve a superior degree of compactness compared to their open cycle counterparts, their use can offset the additional weight of the heat exchangers. This paper applies semi-closed cycles to a high-altitude UAV propulsion system, with the objective of assessing the benefits introduced on the engine performance and weight. A detailed model has been created to account for component performance and size variation as function of thermodynamic parameters. The sizing has been coupled with a multi-objective optimisation algorithm for minimum specific fuel consumption and weight. Results of two different semi-closed cycle configurations are compared with equivalent state-of-the-art open cycles, represented by a recuperated and an intercooled-recuperated engine. The results show that, for a fixed design power output, engine weight is approximately halved compared to state-of-the-art open cycles, with slightly improved specific fuel consumption performance. Optimum semi-closed cycles furthermore operate at higher overall pressure ratios than open cycles and make use of recuperators with higher effectiveness as the mass penalty of the recuperator is smaller due to the lower engine mass flow rates.",Drone,2019
A computational fluid dynamics investigation of subsonic wing designs,"The wing of an unmanned aerial vehicle, RQ-7 Shadow, is modified to study the changes in the aerodynamics of the wing. The main focus is to investigate the effects of changing the components of wing design when the aircraft climbs and accelerates. These component modifications included changing the airfoil, planform, aspect ratio, and adding a winglet. Another objective is to study the efficacy of employing high-lift airfoils like the EPPLER 559 for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications. For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT (R) are conducted for each wing design. The C-L/C-D ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added.",Drone,2019
Conceptual Design of an Unmanned Fixed-Wing Aerial Vehicle Based on,"This paper focuses on the aerodynamics and design of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on solar cells as a main power source. The procedure includes three phases: the conceptual design, preliminary design, and a computational fluid dynamics analysis of the vehicle. One of the main disadvantages of an electric UAV is the flight time; in this sense, the challenge is to create an aerodynamic design that can increase the endurance of the UAV. In this research, the flight mission starts with the attempt of the vehicle design to get at the maximum altitude; then, the UAV starts to glide and battery charge recovery is achieved due to the solar cells. A conceptual design is used, and the aerodynamic analysis is focused on a UAV as a gliding vehicle, with the calculations starting with the estimation of weight and aerodynamics and finishing this stage with the best glide angle. In fact, the aerodynamic analysis is obtained for a preliminary design; this step involves the wing, fuselage, and empennage of the UAV. In order to achieve the preliminary design, an estimation of aerodynamic coefficients, along with computational fluid dynamics analysis, is performed.",Drone,2019
Simultaneous tailplane of small UAV and autopilot system design,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to rise the autonomous flight performance of the small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using simultaneous tailplane of UAV and autopilot system design.

Fuzzy Self-Tuning of Strictly Negative-Imaginary Controllers for Trajectory Tracking of a Quadcopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Robustness in the face of uncertainties is an integral part of designing a real-time control system. Based on negative imaginary (NI) systems theory, we design robust and adaptive control systems for accurate trajectory tracking of a quadcopter aerial vehicle. Considering the challenging dynamics of unmanned aerial vehicles, we employ knowledge-based fuzzy inference systems (FIS) to facilitate automatic tuning in our SNI controllers, leading to the development of adaptive SNI control systems. Unlike fixed-gain controllers that have no ability to adapt to the variations in environmental conditions or changes in the dynamics of the plant, our adaptive SNI controllers are able to perform self-tuning to constantly update their parameters. The concept of adaptive autopilots will enhance the ability of the closed-loop control systems to accommodate large uncertainties. To demonstrate their efficacy, we design and implement our adaptive SNI controllers in the three-position control loops of the AR.Drone quadcopter after conducting extensive computer simulations. We also perform a rigorous comparative study with respect to the performance of fixed-gain SNI controllers, fixed-gain NI systems, in addition to model-predictive-control systems, and proportional integral derivative (PID) control systems as our benchmarks. To complete the study, we conduct a stability analysis based on Kharitonov's Theorem.",Drone,2021
Robust Method for Measuring the Position and Orientation of Drogue Based on Stereo Vision,"The tracking and measurement methods of drogue in autonomous aerial refueling which based 2-D image, because of the loss of depth information, are susceptible to light changes, occlusion, etc., resulting in false tracking and the failure of position and orientation of drogue measurement, which may lead to collision of drones. In order to solve these problems, this article intends to introduce 3-D information to solve the position and orientation of drogue based on the original 2-D image tracking method. The method mainly includes two parts, tracking and measurement algorithms, using the decision function to effectively combine the two algorithms. The tracking algorithm provides a positioning area for the measurement algorithm, thereby reducing the amount of measurement operation data. The 3-D measurement result of the measurement algorithm based on stereo vision is used for measuring the drogue's position and orientation, and fed back to the tracking algorithm, which eliminates the candidate area and reduces the error rate to improve accuracy of the tracking algorithm. The measurement algorithm can still be realized stably high-precision under occlusion and no cooperation markers, which is not available in traditional 2-D image-based methods. We perform semiphysical simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Drone,2021
Efficient Real-Time Human Detection Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Optical Imagery,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are promising technologies within many different application scenarios including human detection in search and rescue and surveillance use cases, which have received considerable attention worldwide. However, adverse conditions, such as varying altitude, overhead camera placement, changing illumination and moving platform, impose challenges for high-performance yet cost-efficient human detection. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel combination of dilated convolutions with Path Aggregation Network (PAN) as a new deep neural network-based human detection algorithm in real time. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive human detection dataset with varying backgrounds, illuminations, and contrast and train the proposed machine-learning model on the collected dataset. Our approach achieves both high precision (88.0% mean Average Precision (mAP)) and real time (67.0 Frames Per Second (FPS)) on a commercial off-the-shelf PC platform. In terms of accuracy, the result is comparable to the standard You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3). However, the speed is twice as that of the standard YOLOv3. YOLOv4 is slightly more accurate (89.8%) than our approach. However, it is slower (38.0 versus 67.0 FPS) and has more Billion Floating-Point Operations (BFLOPS). The proposed algorithm has also trained with the VisDrone2019 dataset and compared with seven studies using this dataset. The results have further validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, the algorithm has been evaluated on an embedded system (Jetson AGX Xavier), which demonstrates the usefulness of this method on power-constrained devices. The proposed algorithm is fast, memory efficient, and computationally less expensive to achieve high detection performance. It is expected to contribute significantly to the wider use of UAV applications including search and rescue missions to locate missing people, and surveillance particularly for applications running on resource-constrained platforms, like smartphones or tablets. This proposed system is now being used in aerial drone system of Police of Scotland to help them locate and find missing and vulnerable people. The results of the project were broadcasted by BBC Scotland.",Drone,2021
Planning of Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems Under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications With Integral Predicates,"We address the problem of coordinating the trajectories of heterogeneous multi-agent systems under spatio-temporal specifications. In particular, we consider global Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints to express the number and type of agents that should be present at specific locations within the desired time windows. We also introduce an integral predicate to specify cumulative progress that can he achieved asynchronously by multiple agents. In order to generate optimal trajectories, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program whose objective is minimizing the agent movement subject to the heterogeneous abstracted dynamics of the agents and a global STL specification including the novel integral predicate. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via simulations and experiments with drones.",Drone,2021
Tracking and Relative Localization of Drone Swarms With a Vision-Based Headset,"We address the detection, tracking, and relative localization of the agents of a drone swarm from a human perspective using a headset equipped with a single camera and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). We train and deploy a deep neural network detector on image data to detect the drones. A joint probabilistic data association filter resolves the detection problems and couples this information with the headset IMU data to track the agents. In order to estimate the drones' relative poses in 3D space with respect to the human, we use an additional deep neural network that processes image regions of the drones provided by the tracker. Finally, to speed up the deep neural networks' training, we introduce an automated labeling process relying on a motion capture system. Several experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The approach is real-time, does not rely on any communication between the human and the drones, and can scale to a large number of agents, often called swarms. It can be used to spatially task a swarm of drones and also employed without a headset for formation control and coordination of terrestrial vehicles.",Drone,2021
Embodied Visual Navigation With Automatic Curriculum Learning in Real Environments,"We present NavACL, a method of automatic curriculum learning tailored to the navigation task. NavACL is simple to train and efficiently selects relevant tasks using geometric features. In our experiments, deep reinforcement learning agents trained using NavACL significantly outperform state-of-the-art agents trained with uniform sampling - the current standard. Furthermore, our agents can navigate through unknown cluttered indoor environments to semantically-specified targets using only RGB images. Obstacle-avoiding policies and frozen feature networks support transfer to unseen real-world environments, without any modification or retraining requirements. We evaluate our policies in simulation, and in the real world on a ground robot and a quadrotor drone. Videos of real-world results are available in the supplementary material.",Drone,2021
Closed-Structure Compliant Gripper With Morphologically Optimized Multi-Material Fingertips for Aerial Grasping,"Aerial grasping empowers unmanned aerial vehicles to find applications beyond structured logistics. However, it brings a number of challenges including inaccurate positioning of the end effector and limited energy sources. Moreover, solutions so far have difficulty in handling a variety of objects. A novel closed structure compliant gripper was developed to address the challenges above. The gripper has a large self-centering work envelope and is normally-closed for passive grasping. Introduction of compliance as a form of morphological computation was also considered to enhance grasping capabilities, where multi-material 3D printing would facilitate rapid design changes based on target application. To grasp different objects, the gripper has hot-swappable 3D printed fingertips which are optimized with a multi-objective Bayesian Optimization process using physical bench experiments mimicking drone grasping and ascent on a common object set. The morphology of the fingertip including tip width, curvature and distribution of soft and hard material on contact surface, are optimized with a bench test that mimics quadcopter takeoff and landing. The best design from optimization shows an improvement of more than 10% from the initial design in successful grasp operations, demonstrated by field tests with a quadcopter.",Drone,2021
Quadcopter Fast Pure Descent Maneuver Avoiding Vortex Ring State Using Yaw-Rate Control Scheme,"Due to their simplicity and agility, nowadays drones especially quadcopters have become popular in many applications. However, they still have a velocity limitation on fast descent maneuvers, which is known as Vortex Ring State (VRS) constraint in the literature. In this paper, first, we provide a brief description of VRS, and formalize a constraint on the quadcopter's velocity regarding the VRS. Then a novel control strategy using the yaw rate has been suggested to avoid the VRS velocity constraint. Finally, the motion of the quadcopter and the proposed controller are examined in both simulation and experiment, and the performance of the system in avoiding the unstable VRS region in a fast descent maneuver is demonstrated. The quadcopter's equations of motion and the Yaw Rate Controller (YRC) are simulated in the Matlab/Simulink software. The experiments show that the quadcopter can descend about three times faster than the regular descent maneuvers, using the YRC algorithm without any instability. This is due to the creation of horizontal airflow on the blade disk by the yaw rate maneuver. By using this algorithm, quadcopters can descend faster to save their flight endurance for their main mission goal. Moreover, since this method guarantees the stability of quadcopters in pure descents, the drone can be used in chimneys inspections.",Drone,2021
"Ultra-Lightweight, Flexible InGaP/GaAs Tandem Solar Cells with a Dual-Function Encapsulation Layer.","Lightweight, flexible solar cells from III-V semiconductors offer new application opportunities for devices that require a power supply, such as cars, drones, satellites, or wearable devices, due to their outstanding efficiency and power-to-weight ratio (specific power). However, the specific power and stability of flexible photovoltaic (PV) devices need to be enhanced for use in such applications because current flexible PV devices are vulnerable to moisture and heat. Here, we develop ultra-lightweight, flexible InGaP/GaAs tandem solar cells with a dual-function encapsulation layer that serves as both a moisture barrier and an antireflection coating for the active device layer. Using a thin polymer film as a substrate and an ultrathin metal as a bonding layer, the total weight of the device is dramatically reduced. Therefore, the specific power of our solar cells is remarkably high with a value of over 5000 W/kg under the AM 1.5G solar spectrum. Additionally, there is no degradation even if the solar cells are exposed to harsh environmental conditions.",Drone,2021
Policing with the drone: Towards an aerial geopolitics of security,"This article explores in empirical detail the air-bound expectations, imaginations and practices arising from the acquisition of a new police drone in the Swiss canton of Neuchatel. The study shows how drones are transforming the ways in which the aerial realm is lived as a context, object and perspective of policing. This tripartite structure is taken as a prism through which to advance novel understandings of the simultaneously elemental and affective, sensory, cognitive and practical dimensions of the aerial volumes within, on and through which drones act. The study of the ways in which these differing dimensions are bound together in how the police think about drones and what they do with them enables the development of an 'aerial geopolitics of security' that, from a security viewpoint, approaches interactions between power and space in a three-dimensional and cross-ontological way.",Drone,2021
Stabilizing Ni-Rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 with Cyclopentyl Isocyanate as a Novel Electrolyte Additive.,"Ni-rich layered structure materials are appealing cathodes for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries developed for electric vehicles, drones, power tools, etc. However, poor interfacial stability between a Ni-rich cathode and carbonate electrolyte, especially at high temperatures, and fast capacity fading still hinder their mass market penetration. Here, we investigate cyclopentyl isocyanate (CPI) with a single isocyanate (-NCO) functional group as a bifunctional electrolyte additive for the first time to improve the interfacial stability of Ni-rich cathode LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 (NCM83). With an electrolyte containing 2 wt % CPI, the NCM83 cathode shows capacity retention of up to 92.3% after 200 cycles at 1C and 30 ¡ãC, much higher than that with the standard electrolyte (78.6%). It is demonstrated that the -NCO of CPI could largely inhibit the thermal decomposition of LiPF6 salt and scavenge water and hydrogen fluoride (HF) species, improving electrolyte stability. More importantly, the additive CPI could be preferentially oxidized, forming a stabilized and protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer on the surface of NCM83, which effectively suppresses the parasitic side reactions and maintains the superior interfacial charge-transfer and lithium-ion diffusion kinetics. Both functions enable a significant improvement in electrochemical performance at both 30 and 60 ¡ãC.",Drone,2021
Proposed Injury Threshold for Drone Blade Lacerations.,"Drones have been increasing in popularity and are able to cause skin injuries ranging from minor abrasions to severe lacerations. The objective of this study was to determine the aspects of drone blades that cause injuries, and to help manufacturers design safer drones by suggesting an injury threshold. The blade tip thickness, blade length, angular velocity, and blade tip speed of a variety of popular drones were measured. The injury caused by each drone blade contacting a fetal bovine skin surrogate at different speeds was recorded. Blade tip speed had the highest correlation to injury severity, while blade tip thickness, blade length, and rpm had little to no correlation with the resulting injury. Blade tip speeds above 25 m/s resulted in minor abrasions, and speeds above 60 m/s resulted in minor lacerations. To prevent severe injuries, drone manufacturers should design drones with blade tip speeds below the threshold of 60 m/s.",Drone,2021
Deep Reinforcement Learning For Multi-User Access Control in Non-Terrestrial Networks,"Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) composed of space-borne (e.g., satellites) and airborne vehicles (e.g., drones and blimps) have recently been proposed by 3GPP as a new paradigm of infrastructures to enhance the capacity and coverage of existing terrestrial wireless networks. The mobility of non-terrestrial base stations (NT-BSs) however leads to a dynamic environment, which imposes unique challenges for handover and throughput optimization particularly in multi-user access control for NTNs. To achieve performance optimization, each terrestrial user equipment (UE) should autonomously estimate the dynamics of moving NT-BSs, which is different from the existing user access control schemes in terrestrial wireless networks. Consequently, new learning schemes for optimum multi-user access control are desired. In this article, we therefore propose a UE-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme, in which a centralized agent deployed at the backhaul side of NT-BSs is responsible for training the parameter of a deep Q-network (DQN), and each UE independently makes its own access decisions based on the parameter from the trained DQN. With the proposed scheme, each UE is able to access a proper NT-BS intelligently to enhance the long-term system throughput and avoid frequent handovers among NT-BSs. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we justify the performance of the proposed scheme, and show its effectiveness in addressing the fundamental issues in the NTNs deployment.",Drone,2021
Inflight Polymerase Chain Reaction of samples with drones,"A system devised to conduct Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in-flight on drones that uses the spatial displacement of capillary tubes on thermal blocks kept at 94 degrees C, 58 degrees C and 72 degrees C corresponding to cycling temperatures for denaturation, annealing and extension is demonstrated here. The use of acetal as the thermal block material reduced heat loss and the input power (within 18.5 W) needed to maintain the required temperatures. Tests showed that concentrations of samples down to 1.16 x 10 (6) DNA copies/mu L could be significantly and consistently detected above the background emission of the fluorescence signal intensity.",Drone,2021
Gbit/s Throughput Under 6.3-W Lossless Hyperspectral Image Compression on Parallel Embedded Devices,"The consultative committee for space data system (CCSDS)-123 is a standard for lossless compression of multispectral and hyperspectral images with applications in on-board power-constrained systems, such as satellites and military drones. This letter explores the low-power heterogeneous architecture of the Nvidia Jetson TX2 by proposing a parallel solution to the CCSDS-123 compressor on embedded systems, reducing development effort compared with the production of dedicated circuits, while maintaining low energy consumption. This solution parallelizes the predictor on a low-power graphics processing unit (GPU) while the encoders exploit the heterogeneous multiple cores of the CPUs and GPU concurrently. We report more than 16.6 Gb/s for the predictor and 1.4-Gb/s for the whole system, requiring less than 6.3 W and providing an efficiency of 245.6 Mb/s/W.",Drone,2021
Aviation Data Lake: Using Side Information to Enhance Future Air-Ground Vehicle Networks,"Future denser air-ground vehicle networks (AGVNs) face challenges such as resource allocation, mobility management, secure transmission, and so on. At the same time, surveillance is a must for modern air traffic management. This motivates us to find opportunities in the aerial vertical by forming a conceptual surveillance plane for aerial vehicles. In this article, we propose an enhanced software-defined network architecture where the surveillance plane can provide local and global surveillance information to macro stations, acting as a side system for the communication links. We review air- ground communications and, by summarizing challenges and opportunities, propose the enhanced architecture of side-information-assisted networks in detail. We then present how we obtain, organize, manage, and utilize the local and global side information by a so-called aviation data lake (ADL). The data lake can be easily connected with advanced machine learning schemes and, thus, provide timely, context-aware metrics and predictions.",Drone,2021
Hybrid PD-Fuzzy and PD Controllers for Trajectory Tracking of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: Autopilot Designs and Real-Time Flight Tests,"This paper presents a hybrid nonlinear control system, comprising of a conventional proportional-differential (PD) controller and a PD-type fuzzy logic autopilot for the trajectory tracking of a quadcopter drone. Given the inherent nature of traditional control, which is model-based, and the essence of fuzzy logic control, which is knowledge-based, the proposed hybrid controllers can provide a more robust solution in the face of uncertainties. Both controllers operate in a parallel incremental form to improve the transient performance and the robustness of the closed-loop control system. Through extensive computer simulations supported by real-time flight tests, this paper highlights the efficacy of the proposed hybrid control system in the presence of some parameter variations, nonlinear aerodynamic models, and some external disturbances (e.g., wind gusts). The Dryden and 1-cos turbulence models are employed to represent the effects of wind gusts under realistic flight environments. The stability analysis of the closed-loop control system is conducted using Lyapunov's indirect method.",Drone,2021
Development of a High Power Density Drive System for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are characterized by a set of requirements, like high efficiency, resiliency, and reliability that conflict with the other main requirement of high power density aimed at minimizing the overall weight and size. This article proposes a novel, modular multiphase drive for a quadrotor drone, realized through the integration of an axial flux permanent magnet machine and a GaN-based power electronic converter. After an overview of the design process, starting from the propeller choice, a brief description of the system components is presented. Focusing specifically on the power electronic converter, the article then presents a full analysis of its electrical and thermal performance. Extensive experimental tests allows to validate the predictions of the design and simulation stages and demonstrated the expected high power density levels.",Drone,2021
Assessment of DSM Based on Radiometric Transformation of UAV Data.,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is one of the latest technologies for high spatial resolution 3D modeling of the Earth. The objectives of this study are to assess low-cost UAV data using image radiometric transformation techniques and investigate its effects on global and local accuracy of the Digital Surface Model (DSM). This research uses UAV Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data from 80 meters and UAV Drone data from 300 and 500 meters flying height. RAW UAV images acquired from 500 meters flying height are radiometrically transformed in Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB). UAV images from 300 meters flying height are processed for the generation of 3D point cloud and DSM in Pix4D Mapper. UAV LIDAR data are used for the acquisition of Ground Control Points (GCP) and accuracy assessment of UAV Image data products. Accuracy of enhanced DSM with DSM generated from 300 meters flight height were analyzed for point cloud number, density and distribution. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value of Z is enhanced from ¡À2.15 meters to 0.11 meters. For local accuracy assessment of DSM, four different types of land covers are statistically compared with UAV LIDAR resulting in compatibility of enhancement technique with UAV LIDAR accuracy.",Drone,2021
PAveMENT: a framework for the intelligent and safe navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles over optimal PAths in MobilE NeTworks,"The demand for using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) is increasing in different applications, such as delivery, environmental monitoring, media, and wireless internet access. In these applications, UAVs are enabled by a cellular device and act as aerial users that need to be served by the underlying mobile-wireless network. The large-scale and low-cost usage of UAVs in such applications/services requires a framework that enables the safe and optimal navigation of UAVs over wide areas. Current cellular mobile networks have the infrastructure and the capability for implementing such frameworks. In contrast to other related work [6,15], in this paper, we propose a framework, called PAveMENT, that provides safe and optimal paths for navigating UAVs where: a) they experience reliable and high-quality communications with the underlying cellular network; b) UAVs cannot fly over no-flying zones and interrupt public/private services, and c) UAVs have minimal impact on the ground users of the mobile network. These are important factors from the perspective of a cellular service provider, as the main enabler for navigating UAVs over wide areas. In this framework, providing safe-optimal paths are performed by constructing a graph around the local area of interest to fly over and computing a least-cost path from the source to the destination. In addition, unlike other related work, we use real network performance indicators, and practical path-loss models with proprietary operational parameters to evaluate the performance of this framework.",Drone,2021
Multi-constrained cooperative path planning of multiple drones for persistent surveillance in urban environments,"Different from the usual surveillance task in which the goal is to achieve complete coverage of the specified area, the cooperative path planning problem of drones for persistent surveillance task is studied in this paper considering multiple constraints of the covered area. The goal is to maximize the combinational coverage area of drones while giving preference to the area that hasn't been visited beyond a certain time interval. The influence of shooting resolution and blocking of buildings are considered, and the state information of each grid is defined to record the visit information of the ground area. Considering the characteristic of the established model, the multi-constrained cooperative path planning (MCCPP) algorithm is developed. The grids which have not been visited for a long time are received special attentions, and the drone is led to reducing the flight height to cover the gird which has a special requirement on the shooting resolution. The cooperation mechanism among drones is also set to ensure that all the drones can determine the next path point synchronously. An emergency path planning algorithm with the continuous checking strategy is designed for a drone to fly to the specified area and finish a complete coverage of it.",Drone,2021
C(3)Net: end-to-end deep learning for efficient real-time visual active camera control,"The need for automated real-time visual systems in applications such as smart camera surveillance, smart environments, and drones necessitates the improvement of methods for visual active monitoring and control. Traditionally, the active monitoring task has been handled through a pipeline of modules such as detection, filtering, and control. However, such methods are difficult to jointly optimize and tune their various parameters for real-time processing in resource constraint systems. In this paper a deep Convolutional Camera Controller Neural Network is proposed to go directly from visual information to camera movement to provide an efficient solution to the active vision problem. It is trained end-to-end without bounding box annotations to control a camera and follow multiple targets from raw pixel values. Evaluation through both a simulation framework and real experimental setup, indicate that the proposed solution is robust to varying conditions and able to achieve better monitoring performance than traditional approaches both in terms of number of targets monitored as well as in effective monitoring time. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it is computationally less demanding and can run at over 10 FPS (similar to 4x speedup) on an embedded smart camera providing a practical and affordable solution to real-time active monitoring.",Drone,2021
Towards accurate and practical drone-based wind measurements with an ultrasonic anemometer,"Wind data collection in the atmospheric boundary layer benefits from short-term wind speed measurements using unmanned aerial vehicles. Fixed-wing and rotary-wing devices with diverse anemometer technology have been used in the past to provide such data, but the accuracy still has the potential to be increased. A lightweight drone for carrying an industry-standard precision sonic anemometer was developed. Accuracy tests have been performed with the isolated anemometer at high tilt angles in a calibration wind tunnel, with the drone flying in a large wind tunnel and with the full system flying at different heights next to a bistatic lidar reference.The propeller-induced flow deflects the air to some extent, but this effect is compensated effectively. The data fusion shows a substantial reduction of crosstalk (factor of 13) between ground speed and wind speed. When compared with the bistatic lidar in very turbulent conditions, with a 10 s averaging interval and with the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) constantly circling around the measurement volume of the lidar reference, wind speed measurements have a bias between -2.0 % and 4.2 % (root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 4.3 % to 15.5 %), vertical wind speed bias is between -0.05 and 0.07 ms(-1) (RMSE of 0.15 to 0.4 ms(-1)), elevation bias is between -1 and 0.7 degrees (RMSE of 1.2 to 6.3 degrees), and azimuth bias is between -2.6 and 7.2 degrees (RMSE of 2.6 to 8.0 degrees). Key requirements for good accuracy under challenging and dynamic conditions are the use of a full-size sonic anemometer, a large distance between anemometer and propellers, and a suitable algorithm for reducing the effect of propeller-induced flow.The system was finally flown in the wake of a wind turbine, successfully measuring the spatial velocity deficit and downwash distribution during forward flight, yielding results that are in very close agreement to lidar measurements and the theoretical distribution. We believe that the results presented in this paper can provide important information for designing flying systems for precise air speed measurements either for short duration at multiple locations (battery powered) or for long duration at a single location (power supplied via cable). UAVs that are able to accurately measure three-dimensional wind might be used as a cost-effective and flexible addition to measurement masts and lidar scans.",Drone,2021
Performance of decoupled electroaerodynamic thrusters,"Solid-state aerodynamic devices, which use electroaerodynamics (EAD) to produce a propulsive force, have the potential to make drones and airplanes significantly quieter and may provide benefits in sustainability and manufacturability. In these devices, ions are accelerated between two electrodes by an electric field, colliding with neutral air molecules and producing an ionic wind and a thrust force. The authors' previous work showed that a ""decoupled"" device architecture, which separates the ionization and ion acceleration processes, can increase thrust density and thrust-to-power compared to the prevailing corona-discharge-based EAD architecture, which uses a single DC potential for both processes. However, the discharge characteristics of this decoupled architecture have not been previously determined. Here, we experimentally characterize a decoupled EAD thruster with a wire-to-wire dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) ion source: an AC voltage drives the DBD, which ionizes neutral air molecules at the emitting electrode, while a separate DC voltage accelerates ions toward the collecting electrode. We determine the discharge characteristics (i.e., the DC-current-to-DC-voltage relationship) of this decoupled thruster as well as a model for the interaction between the ionization and acceleration stages: we find that the former takes the same functional form as the analytical solution for space-charge limited current in a thin collisional ion channel, whereas the latter is determined primarily by the power draw of the DBD ionization stage. We present a complete model for the thrust and power draw of decoupled EAD thrusters, enabling their quantitative design and optimization for use in aircraft propulsion and other applications.",Drone,2021
Spectral Discrimination Sensors Based on Nanomaterials and Nanostructures: A Review,"Imaging sensors as a critical technology are greatly significant in numerous light detection applications including security monitor, smart mobile devices, machine vision, navigation, self-driving, drones and remote sensing etc. In particular, spectral imaging technology such as multispectral and hyperspectral imaging are attracting more and more attention due to the available spectral and spatial information, which provide an opportunity for deeper cognition of the detected object. However, conventional strategy for wavelength sensing by complicated optical system has obstacle in achieving lightweight, low cost, high quality image and high pixel densities. Therefore, new emerging strategies based on the nanomaterials and nanostructures involving filter-assisted and filter-free light detection are explored to achieve precise spectral discrimination. Here, we review the latest advances of these emerging approaches for spectral discrimination. Furthermore, every filter-assisted and filter-free strategy was discussed and compared in detail by analyzing their fundamental physical principles.",Drone,2021
High-rate and high sulfur-loaded lithium-sulfur batteries with a polypyrrole-coated sulfur cathode on a 3D aluminum foam current collector,"In this study, the high-rate performance of high sulfur-loaded cathodes have been demonstrated using a novel battery that comprises of a 3 dimensional aluminum foam (current collector), sulfur (active material), acetylene black (conductive additive), and polypyrrole (PPy) coating. Consequently, a stacked laminated cell was prepared, which comprised of two 70 x 70 mm(2) PPy-sulfur/ketjen black sheets (sulfur loading = 4.3 mg/cm(2)), 1 M lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) with dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), (DME/DOL = 1/1 vol%), and three Li foils as the cathodes, electrolyte, and anodes, respectively. The 1 M LiTFSI DME/DOL electrolyte, which is suitable for high rate, is applicable because the PPy coating suppresses dissolution of polysulfide into the electrolyte. The discharge capacities were 462 mAh (1075 mAh/g sulfur) at 0.4C (267 mA) and 251 mAh (583 mAh/g-sulfur) at 3.8C (2670 mA). An enhanced conductive path was formed in the cathode by the 3D Al foam and AB, which considerably improved the high-rate performance. This demonstration is particularly significant from the viewpoint of commercializing the high-power output and high-energy-density Li-S batteries for industrial applications such as small mobile device and drone power source.

Aerial filming with synchronized drones using reinforcement learning,"Usage of multiple drones is necessary for aerial filming applications to ensure redundancy. However, this could inevitably contribute to higher risks of collisions, especially when the number of drones increases. Hence, this motivates us to explore various autonomous flight formation control methods that have the potential to enable multiple drones to effectively track a specific target at the same time. In this paper, we designed a model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which is mainly based on the Deep Recurrent Q-Network concept, for the aforementioned purposes. The proposed algorithm was expanded into single and multi-agent types that enable multiple drones tracking while maintaining formation and preventing collision. The involved rewards in these approaches are two-dimensional in nature and are dependent on the communication system. Using Microsoft AirSim simulator, a virtual environment that includes four virtual drones was developed for experimental purposes. A comparison was made among various methods during the simulations, and the results concluded that the recurrent, single-agent model is the most effective method, being 33% more effective than its recurrent, multi-agent counterparts. The poor performance of the non-recurrent, single-agent baseline model also suggests that the recurrent elements in the network are essential to enable desirable multiple-drones flight.",Drone,2021
Security Threats and Defensive Approaches in Machine Learning System Under Big Data Environment,"Under big data environment, machine learning has been rapidly developed and widely used. It has been successfully applied in computer vision, natural language processing, computer security and other application fields. However, there are many security problems in machine learning under big data environment. For example, attackers can add ""poisoned"" sample to the data source, and big data process system will process these ""poisoned"" sample and use machine learning methods to train model, which will directly lead to wrong prediction results. In this paper, machine learning system and machine learning pipeline are proposed. The security problems that maybe occur in each stage of machine learning system under big data processing pipeline are analyzed comprehensively. We use four different attack methods to compare the attack experimental results.The security problems are classified comprehensively, and the defense approaches to each security problem are analyzed. Drone-deploy MapEngine is selected as a case study, we analyze the security threats and defense approaches in the Drone-Cloud machine learning application envirolment. At last,the future development drections of security issues and challenages in the machine learning system are proposed.",Drone,2021
Saving Private Robot: Risks and Advantages of Anthropomorphism in Agent-Soldier Teams,"Hybrid military teams, formed by human warfighters and autonomous artificial agents, represent the technological future of Defence operations. Both the potential and the inherent limitations of current technology are well-known, but the cognitive-behavioral and motivational aspects of human-robot interaction on the battlefield have yet to be systematically investigated. To lay the theoretical and methodological foundation of this scientific investigation, our position paper critically examines how the military personnel's spontaneous tendency to anthropomorphize artificial autonomous agents can affect operations of hybrid military teams in multiple ways. We will argue that the psychological impact of anthropomorphism on military personnel is neither easily avoidable nor necessarily detrimental. Correctly identifying the multi-level cognitive mechanisms that underpin implicit and explicit forms of anthropomorphism allows us to increase the efficacy of human-agent interaction. We will argue that, within hybrid teams, the capability to communicate with teammates, allies, civilians, and adversaries relies on embodied social cognition processes that are inherently geared toward anthropomorphism and leverage its effects. By updating both the design of autonomous artificial agents and the training of human troops to account for these processes, their reciprocal coordination can be augmented.",Drone,2021
Autonomous long-range drone detection system for critical infrastructure safety,"The development of unmanned aerial vehicles has been identified as a potential source of a weapon for causing operational disruptions against critical infrastructures. To mitigate and neutralise the threat posed by the misuse of drones against malicious and terrorist activity, this paper presents a holistic design of a long-range autonomous drone detection platform. The novelty of the proposed system lies in the confluence between the design of hardware and software components to effective and efficient localisation of the intruder objects. The research presented in the paper proposes the design and validation of a situation awareness component which is interfaced with the hardware component for controlling the focal length of the camera. The continuous stream of media data obtained from the region of vulnerability is processed using the object detection that is built on region based fully connected neural network. The novelty of the proposed system relies on the processing of multi-threaded dual-media input streams that are evaluated to mitigate the latency of the system. Upon the successful detection of malicious drones, the system logs the occurrence of intruders that consists of both event description and the associated media evidence for the deployment of the mitigation strategy. The analytics platform that controls the signalling of the low-cost sensing equipment contains the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 for detecting drones. The experimental testbeds developed for the validation of the proposed system has been constructed to include environments and situations that are commonly faced by critical infrastructure operators such as the area of protection, drone flight path, tradeoff between the angle of coverage against the distance of coverage. The validation of the proposed system has resulted in yielding a range of intruder drone detection by 250m with an accuracy of 95.5%.",Drone,2021
Energy-Efficient Swarming Flight Formation Transitions Using the Improved Fair Hungarian Algorithm.,"Recently, drone shows have impressed many people through a convergence of technology and art. However, these demonstrations have limited operating hours based on the battery life. Thus, it is important to minimize the unnecessary transition time between scenes without collision to increase operating time. This paper proposes a fast and energy-efficient scene transition algorithm that minimizes the transition times between scenes. This algorithm reduces the maximum drone movement distance to increase the operating time and exploits a multilayer method to avoid collisions between drones. In addition, a swarming flight system including robust communication and position estimation is presented as a concrete experimental system. The proposed algorithm was verified using the swarming flight system at a drone show performed with 100 drones.",Drone,2021
A quantitative cross-comparison of container networking technologies for virtualized service infrastructures in local computing environments,"Container networking is emerging as a game-changer paradigm for the deployment of virtualized service infrastructures in a faster and reliable way. Nevertheless, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are still skeptical to revise their business in this direction because of the absence of deep studies showing its effectiveness in real deployments leveraging local computing environments. To bridge this gap, this article presents a quantitative cross-comparison of cutting-edge technologies for container networking (including Docker as a container engine, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes as orchestrators, bare-metal and OpenStack cloud as deployment platform), properly integrated to realize a virtualized service infrastructure within a commercial workstation. Initial experimental tests are conducted to identify the most suitable combination of technologies for high-load environments, where many clients contact the virtualized service infrastructure to download files of large size. Obtained results demonstrate that the combination of Docker and Kubernetes generally ensures better performance on the bare-metal deployment platform, thus emerging as mature and effective solutions to be used by SMEs. Finally, the behavior of the identified virtualized service infrastructure is also evaluated in a smart farm use case, where containers are in charge of processing images provided by mobile drones for monitoring purposes. In addition, in this case, the conducted study highlights the promising capability offered by container networking in real deployments, exploiting local computing environments.",Drone,2021
"Towards Systematic Design of General Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Controllers: Analysis, Interpretation, and Tuning","This article aims to provide a new perspective on how the deployment of general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy sets affects the mapping of a class of fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs). It is shown that an alpha-plane represented a GT2-FLC is easily designed via baseline type-1 and interval type-2 FLCs and two design parameters (DPs). The DPs are the total number of alpha planes and the tuning parameter of the secondary membership function that are interpreted as sensitivity and shape DPs, respectively. We provide a clear understanding and interpretation of the sensitivity and shape DPs on controller performance through various comparative analyses. We present design approaches on how to tune the shape DP by providing a tradeoff between robustness and performance. We also propose two online scheduling mechanisms to tune the shape DP. We explore the effect of the sensitivity DP on the GT2-FLC and provide practical insights on how to tune the sensitivity DP. We present an algorithm for tuning the sensitivity DP that provides a compromise between computational time and sensitivity. We validate our analyses, interpretations, and design methods with experimental results conducted on a drone. We believe that this article provides clear explanations on the role of DPs on the performance, robustness, sensitivity, and computational time of GT2-FLCs.",Drone,2021
Exploiting Object Similarity for Robotic Visual Recognition,"In this article, we are interested in robotic visual object classification using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) classifier. We show that the correlation coefficient of the automatically learned DCNN features of two object images carries robust information on their similarity, and can be utilized to significantly improve the robot's classification accuracy, without additional training. More specifically, we first probabilistically analyze how the feature correlation carries vital similarity information and build a correlation-based Markov random field (CoMRF) for joint object labeling. Given query and motion budgets, we then propose an optimization framework to plan the robot's query and path based on our CoMRF. This gives the robot a new way to optimally decide which object sites to move close to for better sensing and for which objects to ask a remote human for help with classification, which considerably improves the overall classification. We extensively evaluate our proposed approach on two large datasets (e.g., drone imagery and indoor scenes) and several real-world robotic experiments. The results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the benchmarks.",Drone,2021
Marker-Based Method for Recognition of Camera Position for Mobile Robots,"Position recognition is one of the core technologies for driving a robot because of differences in environment and rapidly changing situations. This study proposes a strategy for estimating the position of a camera mounted on a mobile robot. The proposed strategy comprises three methods. The first is to directly acquire information (e.g., identification (ID), marker size and marker type) to recognize the position of the camera relative to the marker. The advantage of this marker system is that a combination of markers of different sizes or having different information may be used without having to update the internal parameters of the robot system even if the user frequently changes or adds to the marker's identification information. In the second, two novel markers are proposed to consider the real environment in which real robots are applied: a nested marker and a hierarchical marker. These markers are proposed to improve the ability of the camera to recognize markers while the camera is moving on the mobile robot. The nested marker is effective for robots like drones, which land and take off vertically with respect to the ground. The hierarchical marker is suitable for robots that move horizontally with respect to the ground such as wheeled mobile robots. The third method is the calculation of the position of an added or moved marker based on a reference marker. This method automatically updates the positions of markers after considering the change in the driving area of the mobile robot. Finally, the proposed methods were validated through experiments.",Drone,2021
Future FANET with application and enabling techniques: Anatomization and sustainability issues,"Rapid expansion and technological advancement of Wireless communication lead by researchers in different fields of engineering have achieved various milestones. Its efficient use has proven that days are not too far when even we think of anything flying sensors, actuators of multiple types surrounded by us process it, and try to bring down or show the best possible result. One of the most talked-about innovations in drones the day it was invented. Group of Drones working in a collectively and Ad hoc manner form a Flying Ad hoc network (FANET). The Mobility of UAVs makes it more accessible, which helps in the mobile revolution that the present world is going through. The use of such a network in different applications across the globe is highly demanding. Most of the traditional study compares it with other Ad hoc networks and coupling, relating to them. However, FANET has its considerations relating to the same class of system. This paper presents a comprehensive survey relating FANET and critical points regarding it, ranging from the categorization of FANET, the architecture of FANET, types of possible communication in FANET, numerous Mobility Models, constraints in FANET, characteristics, and design of FANET, routing protocol, and routing topology. We further present open issues and challenges in FANET relating to essential parameters and research. It endeavored to store all the recommendations to encourage the researchers to function in this particular area and the same class of network. Deterministic jointly with probabilistic points of studies compiled and listed with the belief that deterministic methods should be in association with stochastic approaches for better results in FANET.

"A stochastic scheduling, allocation, and inventory replenishment problem for battery swap stations","Electric vehicles and drones promise to transform transportation systems and supply chains. However, long recharge times and battery degradation inhibit adoption. To overcome these barriers, swap stations enable quick battery exchange. We introduce a stochastic scheduling, allocation, and inventory replenishment problem which determines the charging, discharging, and replacement decisions at a swap station over time. The decisions are complex because recharging is necessary for short-term operation but causes degradation and the need for future replacement. We model the problem as a Markov Decision Process, solve it using backward induction, and show that the problem suffers from the curses of dimensionality. Hence, we propose two approximate methods, a heuristic benchmark policy and a reinforcement learning method, which provide high-quality solutions. Using a designed experiment, we deduce effective operational insights.",Drone,2021
Robust Maximum Coverage Facility Location Problem with Drones Considering Uncertainties in Battery Availability and Consumption,"Given a set of a spatially distributed demand for a specific commodity, potential facility locations, and drones, an agency is tasked with locating a pre-specified number of facilities and assigning drones to them to serve the demand while respecting drone range constraints. The agency seeks to maximize the demand served while considering uncertainties in initial battery availability and battery consumption. The facilities have a limited supply of the commodity being distributed and also act as a launching site for drones. Drones undertake one-to-one trips (from located facility to demand location and back) until their available battery energy is exhausted. This paper extends the work done by Chauhan et al. and presents an integer linear programming formulation to maximize coverage using a robust optimization framework. The uncertainty in initial battery availability and battery consumption is modeled using a penalty-based approach and gamma robustness, respectively. A novel robust three-stage heuristic (R3SH) is developed which provides objective values which are within 7% of the average solution reported by MIP solver with a median reduction in computational time of 97% on average. Monte Carlo simulation based testing is performed to assess the value of adding robustness to the deterministic problem. The robust model provides higher and more reliable estimates of actual coverage under uncertainty. The average maximum coverage difference between the robust optimization solution and the deterministic solution is 8.1% across all scenarios.",Drone,2021
Time Efficient Unmanned Aircraft Systems Deployment in Disaster Scenarios Using Clustering Methods and a Set Cover Approach,"Unmanned aircraft, which are more commonly known as drones, are nowadays extensively used in an ever increasing set of applications. In a wider system, the aircraft are usually associated to additional elements such as ground-based controllers. Furthermore, when these components form a network of elements that can communicate, the system is said to form an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). This system is particularly effective when the aircraft within are organized into swarms with sets of objectives to accomplish. The extensive use of swarms into UASs is more and more exploited nowadays due to the decreasing cost of those aircraft. In the present work we are interested in a particular application of UASs, namely their deployment in disaster scenarios for communications services provision to targets on the ground. These ground targets, however, are not part of the UASs and should not be confused with ground-based controllers. The present work does not only focus on coverage for ground targets but also on a guaranteed minimum number of covers for each target, which is called the redundancy requirement. The research work also ensures that the deployed UAS forms a unique connected component so that a steady stream of communication is kept with the targets to cover. Research work similar to the present perform the initial deployment of their aircraft in a different manner, either randomly, based on a predetermined grid formation, or using other elaborated methods. This work proposes a new solution based on the use of clustering algorithms, combined to a design of the problem formulated as a set cover optimization model. The clustering phase is used to discretize the search space and ease the optimization phase by locating regions of interest, and then a further procedure is applied, only when needed, to reconnect scattered connected components and guarantee connectivity in the networks. This way of doing it has achieved a deployment of UASs with maximum coverage for all targets, a guaranteed minimum number of covers for each of them, and results in a competitive computation time. The latter also allowed for more scalability by extending the tests to very large input instances.",Drone,2021
New Insights From Conceptual Design of an Additive Manufactured 300 W Microgas Turbine Toward Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Applications,"Owing to the high energy density of hydrocarbon fuels, ultramicrogas turbines (UMGT) with power outputs below 1 kW have clear potential as battery replacement in drones. However, previous works on gas turbines of this scale revealed severe challenges due to air bearing failures, heat transfer from turbine to compressor, rotordynamic instability, and manufacturing limitations. To overcome these obstacles, a novel gas turbine architecture is proposed based on conventional roller bearing technology that operates at up to 500,000 RPM and an additively manufactured monolithic rotor in cantilevered configuration, equipped with internal cooling blades. The optimum turbomachinery design is elaborated using diabatic cycle calculation, coupled with turbomachinery meanline design code. This approach provides new insights on the interdependencies of heat transfer, component efficiency, and system electric efficiency. Thereby, a reduced design pressure ratio of 2.5 with 1200 K turbine inlet temperature (TIT) is identified as most suitable for 300 W electric power output. In following, a review of available additive manufacturing technologies yields material properties, surface roughness, and design constraints for the monolithic rotor. Rotordynamic simulations are then conducted for four available materials using a simplified rotor model to identify valid permanent magnet dimensions that would avoid operation close to bending modes. To complete the baseline engine architecture, a novel radial inflow combustor concept is proposed based on porous inert media combustion. computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are conducted to quantify compressor efficiency and conjugate heat transfer (CHT) analysis of the monolithic rotor is performed to assess the benefit of the internal cooling cavity and vanes for different rotor materials. It is demonstrated that the cavity flow absorbs large amount of heat flux from turbine to compressor, thus cooling the rotor structure and improving the diabatic cycle efficiency. Finally, the results of this conceptual study show that ultramicrogas turbine with electric efficiency of up to 5% is feasible, while energy density is increased by factor of 3.6, compared to lithium-ion batteries.",Drone,2021
A Comparative Study of 3D UE Positioning in 5G New Radio with a Single Station,"The 5G network is considered as the essential underpinning infrastructure of manned and unmanned autonomous machines, such as drones and vehicles. Besides aiming to achieve reliable and low-latency wireless connectivity, positioning is another function provided by the 5G network to support the autonomous machines as the coexistence with the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is typically supported on smart 5G devices. This paper is a pilot study of using 5G uplink physical layer channel sounding reference signals (SRSs) for 3D user equipment (UE) positioning. The 3D positioning capability is backed by the uniform rectangular array (URA) on the base station and by the multiple subcarrier nature of the SRS. In this work, the subspace-based joint angle-time estimation and statistics-based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms are investigated with the 3D signal manifold to prove the feasibility of using SRSs for 3D positioning. The positioning performance of both algorithms is evaluated by estimation of the root mean squared error (RMSE) versus the varying signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), the bandwidth, the antenna array configuration, and multipath scenarios. The simulation results show that the uplink SRS works well for 3D UE positioning with a single base station, by providing a flexible resolution and accuracy for diverse application scenarios with the support of the phased array and signal estimation algorithms at the base station.",Drone,2021
Constrained Urban Airspace Design for Large-Scale Drone-Based Delivery Traffic,"Large-scale adoption of drone-based delivery in urban areas promise societal benefits with respect to emissions and on-ground traffic congestion, as well as potential cost savings for drone-based logistic companies. However, for this to materialise, the ability of accommodating high volumes of drone traffic in an urban airspace is one of the biggest challenges. For unconstrained airspace, it has been shown that traffic alignment and segmentation can be used to mitigate conflict probability. The current study investigates the application of these principles to a highly constrained airspace. We propose two urban airspace concepts, applying road-based analogies of two-way and one-way streets by imposing horizontal structure. Both of the airspace concepts employ heading-altitude rules to vertically segment cruising traffic according to their travel direction. These airspace configurations also feature transition altitudes to accommodate turning flights that need to decrease the flight speed in order to make safe turns at intersections. While using fast-time simulation experiments, the performance of these airspace concepts is compared and evaluated for multiple traffic demand densities in terms of safety, stability, and efficiency. The results reveal that an effective way to structure drone traffic in a constrained urban area is to have vertically segmented altitude layers with respect to travel direction as well as horizontal constraints imposed to the flow of traffic. The study also makes recommendations for areas of future research, which are aimed at supporting dynamic traffic demand patterns.",Drone,2021
Analysis of Multi-Coil Omnidirectional Energy Harvester,"An omnidirectional energy harvester with a multi-coil structure for the wireless power transfer (WPT) system is proposed and analyzed. Compared with the traditional single-direction receivers, this harvester can provide more homogenous output power with relatively high transmission efficiency under arbitrary transmission directions. An analytical solution for mutual inductance calculation in the WPT system with multiple coils is derived. The influence of the mutual inductance under different angle inclinations on the magnetic flux leakage and transmission efficiency is analyzed accordingly. The proposed energy harvester has successfully transmitted over 20 W power with 110 mm, which is over twice of the radii of the receiving coils. The transmission directions can vary over 0 degrees-360 degrees with an efficiency of around 85% and the output power fluctuation within 5%. Thus, the performance is much better than the traditional receiver on both efficiency and stability of output power, especially when transmission direction changes or the receivers have a relatively large misalignment. The proposed energy harvester is particularly attractive for wireless charging of moving devices with 3-D trajectories such as drones or medical equipment.",Drone,2021
Web AR Solution for UAV Pilot Training and Usability Testing,"Data and services are available anywhere at any time thanks to the Internet and mobile devices. Nowadays, there are new ways of representing data through trendy technologies such as augmented reality (AR), which extends our perception of reality through the addition of a virtual layer on top of real-time images. The great potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for carrying out routine and professional tasks has encouraged their use in the creation of several services, such as package delivery or industrial maintenance. Unfortunately, drone piloting is difficult to learn and requires specific training. Since regular training is performed with virtual simulations, we decided to propose a multiplatform cloud-hosted solution based in Web AR for drone training and usability testing. This solution defines a configurable trajectory through virtual elements represented over barcode markers placed on a real environment. The main goal is to provide an inclusive and accessible training solution which could be used by anyone who wants to learn how to pilot or test research related to UAV control. For this paper, we reviewed drones, AR, and human-drone interaction (HDI) to propose an architecture and implement a prototype, which was built using a Raspberry Pi 3, a camera, and barcode markers. The validation was conducted using several test scenarios. The results show that a real-time AR experience for drone pilot training and usability testing is achievable through web technologies. Some of the advantages of this approach, compared to traditional methods, are its high availability by using the web and other ubiquitous devices; the minimization of technophobia related to crashes; and the development of cost-effective alternatives to train pilots and make the testing phase easier for drone researchers and developers through trendy technologies.",Drone,2021
"Design and Control of Soft Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ""S-CLOUD""","Short time-of-flight and safety concerns owing to low efficiency and fast rotation of propellers, respectively, are hurdles in the usage of drones. Usually, drones are carrying out missions that distant from the people like aerial photography, measurement, delivery, and surveillance, and, thus, it is not allowed to deploy drones above crowds. In this article, we present a novel soft drone called S-CLOUD that has longer time-of-flight (more than an hour) and higher user safety. It is composed of a torus-shaped envelope made of soft material, filled with Helium gas, and a center flow control unit mounted at the center of the envelope for producing translational (X-, Y-, and Z-axes) and rotational (Z-axis) motions.

Moreover, sensor-based feedback control algorithms and their experimental results are described. Finally, applications with S-CLOUD exhibiting its feasibility are also presented.",Drone,2021
Multi-objects Detection and Segmentation for Scene Understanding Based on Texton Forest and Kernel Sliding Perceptron,"In the recent days, scene understanding has become hot research topic due to its real usage at perceiving, analyzing and recognizing different dynamic scenes coverage during GPS monitoring system, drone's targets, auto-driving and tourist guide. The goal of scene understanding is to make machines look at like humans do, which means the accurate recognition of the contents in scenes and during location observations. Then, we perform two operations such as (1) to perfectly describe the whole environment and (2) to describe what action is going on in the environment. Due to complex scene analysis, recognition of multiple objects and the relation between the objects remain as a challenging part of the research. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach for the scene understanding that integrates multiple objects detection/segmentation and scene labeling using Geometric features, Histogram of oriented gradient and scale invariant feature transform descriptors. The complete procedure of the purposed model includes resizing and noise removing of images from the dataset, multiple object segmentation and detection, feature extraction and multiple object recognition using multi-layer kernel sliding perceptron. After that, scene recognition is achieved by using multi-class logistic regression. Finally, two datasets such as MSRC and UIUC sports are used for the experimental evaluation of our proposed method. Our purposed method accurately handles the complex objects physical exclusion and objects occlusion. Therefore, it outperforms in term of accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.",Drone,2021
Impact of lift propeller drag on the performance of eVTOL lift plus cruise aircraft,"Electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft of the lift+cruise configuration are significantly impacted by the drag of the lift propellers even though they are only briefly used for takeoff and landing. This work aims to quantify the drag penalty of these high lift propellers, its impact on the performance of a lift+cruise eVTOL aircraft, and potential benefits from retracting the propellers during cruise. An eVTOL model is tested in the wind tunnel with propellers extended and retracted. Results show that retracting the propellers reduces parasitic drag by 38%. This measured drag reduction is used to estimate the performance of a passenger eVTOL and a surveillance drone employing a propeller retraction system. A passenger carrying eVTOL lift+cruise aircraft with a propeller retraction system could cruise 21% faster, at the same mission range, or increase range by 13% at the same flight speed. When endurance is the main mission objective, the benefits are smaller, in the order of 7%, and the potential gains are more sensitive to the weight of the retraction system.

A Ka-Band MMIC LNA in GaN-on-Si 100-nm Technology for High Dynamic Range Radar Receivers,"A Ka-band monolithic low-noise amplifier (LNA) with high gain and high dynamic range (DR) has been designed and implemented in a 100-nm gallium nitride (GaN)-on-Si technology.

Handover Rate and Sojourn Time Analysis in Mobile Drone-Assisted Cellular Networks,"To improve capacity and overcome some of the limitations of traditional terrestrial cellular wireless networks, drones with aerial base stations can be deployed (e.g., to improve coverage, alleviate congestion, support overflow traffic). The mobility of drones allows flexible network reconfiguration to adapt to dynamic traffic and channel conditions. However, this is achieved at the expense of more handovers since even a static user may experience a handover when the drones are mobile. In this letter, we provide an exact analysis of the handover rate and sojourn time (time between two subsequent handovers) for a network of drone base stations. We also show that among different speed distributions with the same mean, the handover rate is minimum when all drone base stations move with the same speed.",Drone,2021
Mobility loss and its restoration in China grasslands.,"Loss of mobility in rangeland use has emerged as a dominant theory to explain ecosystem degradation in the research area of rangeland ecology. The loss of mobility in rangeland use in China resulted from multiple interacting natural and social factors as well as policy changes. Re-establi-shing mobility in rangeland use is critical to rangeland restoration and sustainable management in China. However, the recovery of rangeland might be difficult through simply reverting to traditional rotational grazing. Alternatively, we explored various state-of-the-art rangeland management techniques, including smart fence, intelligent wearables for livestock, and rapid forage biomass measurement using drones. Such novel rangeland management techniques could be used in different regions with different climate and vegetation in China to re-establish mobility in rangeland utilization. Paired with these advanced techniques, new rotational high-mobility grazing systems could further integrate with other essential measures of grass-livestock husbandry in China, such as balancing of forage production and livestock grazing, supplemental forage of livestock, and replenishment of soil nutrients in rangeland. All these practices would ensure a more sustainable and effective utilization of rangeland in China.²ÝµØÀûÓÃÒÆ¶¯ÐÔµÄÉ¥Ê§µ¼ÖÂÉúÌ¬ÏµÍ³ÍË»¯,ÊÇ²ÝµØ·ÅÄÁÉúÌ¬Ñ§ÁìÓòÐËÆðµÄÖ÷µ¼ÐÔÑ§Ëµ¡£ÔÚÎÒ¹ú,²ÝµØÀûÓÃÒÆ¶¯ÐÔµÄÉ¥Ê§²»½öÊÇÕþ²ß±ä»¯µ¼ÖÂµÄ,¸üÊÇÖÚ¶à×ÔÈ»ºÍÉç»áÒòËØµþ¼ÓÑÝ½øµÄ½á¹û¡£²ÝµØÀûÓÃÒÆ¶¯ÐÔµÄÖØ½¨¶ÔÓÚÖÐ¹ú²ÝµØ»Ö¸´ºÍ¿É³ÖÐøÐÔ¹ÜÀí¾ßÓÐÖØÒªÒâÒå,µ«ÊÇºÜÄÑÍ¨¹ý»Ö¸´´«Í³»ò¼¾½ÚÐÔÂÖÄÁµÄÍ¾¾¶ÊµÏÖ¡£ÎÒÃÇ¿ÉÒÔÒÀÍÐÖÇÄÜÎ§À¸¡¢ÉüÐóÖÇÄÜ¿É´©´÷Éè±¸ÒÔ¼°²ÝµØÉú²úÁ¦ÎÞÈË»ú¿ì²âµÈÐÂÐÍ·ÅÄÁ¹ÜÀí¼¼Êõ,ÔÚÎÒ¹ú²»Í¬ÆøºòÇøÓò¡¢²»Í¬ÀàÐÍ²ÝµØ,ÒòµØÖÆÒËµØ·¢Õ¹ÐÂÐÍ²ÝµØÒÆ¶¯ÐÔ¹ÜÀíÄ£Ê½,½ø¶øÖØ½¨²ÝµØÀûÓÃµÄÒÆ¶¯ÐÔ¡£ÐÂÐÍÂÖÄÁÄ£Ê½»¹Ó¦Óë²ÝÐóÆ½ºâ¡¢ÉüÐó²¹ËÇÒÔ¼°ÍÁÈÀÑø·Ö²¹³äµÈÖØÒªÉúÌ¬²ÝÄÁÒµ´ëÊ©½áºÏ,È·±£ÎÒ¹ú²ÝµØ×ÊÔ´µÄ¸ßÐ§¿É³ÖÐøÀûÓÃ¡£.",Drone,2021
Vector Magnetometry Using Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems: An Example of Application for Planetary Exploration,"Geomagnetic prospection is an efficient and environmentally friendly geophysical method for the analysis of the magnetic minerals' distribution in the subsurface. High-resolution measurements require on-ground campaigns. However, these activities might imply high costs, risk and time consumption. Some more recent works have started to use magnetometers on-board remote piloted aircrafts. Normally, they fly at a constant altitude and use scalar probes. This configuration permits the determination of the magnitude of the magnetic field but not the direction, and requires advanced techniques for in-depth interpretation of the sources. In this manuscript, we describe the accommodation of a system for vector magnetometry in a drone whose flight altitude follows the elevation of the terrain. This singularity improves the capability of interpretation, including constraints in dating due to the record of the geomagnetic field. The work consists of the design, development and implementation of a solidary payload system anchored to the body of the platform in order to determine the vector magnetic field. It describes the details of the system and the performance characteristics obtained after the calibration, as well as its demonstration via a field campaign in the spatter deposits of Cerro Gordo volcano in Campos de Calatrava volcanic province in Spain.",Drone,2021
Psychoacoustic analysis of contra-rotating propeller noise for unmanned aerial vehicles.,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies are rapidly advancing due to the unlimited number of applications from parcel delivery to people transportation. As the UAV market expands, community noise impact will become a significant problem for public acceptance. Compact drone architectures based on contra-rotating propellers bring significant benefits in terms of aerodynamic performance and redundancy to ensure vehicle control in case of component failure. However, contra-rotating propellers are severely noisy if not designed appropriately. In the framework of a perception-influenced design approach, this paper investigates the optimal rotor spacing distance configuration to minimise noise annoyance. On the basis of a series of psychoacoustic metrics (i.e., loudness, fluctuation strength, roughness, sharpness, and tonality) and psychoacoustic annoyance (PA) models, the optimal rotor axial separation distance (expressed as a function of propeller blade diameter) is at a range from 0.2 to 0.4. This paper also discusses the performance of currently available psychoacoustic models to predict propeller noise annoyance and defines further work to develop a PA model optimised for rotating systems.",Drone,2021
Autonomous Vision-Based Primary Distribution Systems Porcelain Insulators Inspection Using UAVs,"The early detection of damaged (partially broken) outdoor insulators in primary distribution systems is of paramount importance for continuous electricity supply and public safety. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present a safer, autonomous, and efficient way to examine the power system components without closing the power distribution system. In this work, a novel dataset is designed by capturing real images using UAVs and manually generated images collected to overcome the data insufficiency problem. A deep Laplacian pyramid-based super-resolution network is implemented to reconstruct high-resolution training images. To improve the visibility of low-light images, a low-light image enhancement technique is used for the robust exposure correction of the training images. A different fine-tuning strategy is implemented for fine-tuning the object detection model to increase detection accuracy for the specific faulty insulators. Several flight path strategies are proposed to overcome the shuttering effect of insulators, along with providing a less complex and time- and energy-efficient approach for capturing a video stream of the power system components. The performance of different object detection models is presented for selecting the most suitable one for fine-tuning on the specific faulty insulator dataset. For the detection of damaged insulators, our proposed method achieved an F1-score of 0.81 and 0.77 on two different datasets and presents a simple and more efficient flight strategy. Our approach is based on real aerial inspection of in-service porcelain insulators by extensive evaluation of several video sequences showing robust fault recognition and diagnostic capabilities. Our approach is demonstrated on data acquired by a drone in Swat, Pakistan.",Drone,2021
On the Sizing of the DC-Link Capacitor to Increase the Power Transfer in a Series-Series Inductive Resonant Wireless Charging Station,"Wireless inductive-coupled power transfer is a very appealing technique for the battery recharge of autonomous devices like surveillance drones. The charger design mainly focuses on lightness and fast-charging to improve the drone mission times and reduce the no-flight gaps. The charger secondary circuit mounted on the drone generally consists of a full-bridge rectifier and a second-order filter. The filter cut-off frequency is usually chosen to make the rectifier output voltage constant and so that the battery is charged with continuous quantities. Previous works showed that an increase in power transfer is achieved, if compared to the traditional case, when the second-order filter resonant frequency is close to the double of the wireless charger excitation and the filter works in resonance. This work demonstrates that the condition of resonance is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the power increment. The bridge rectifier diodes must work in discontinuous-mode to improve the power transfer. The paper also investigates the dependence of the power transfer increase on the wireless excitation frequency. It is found the minimum frequency value below which the power transfer gain is not possible. This frequency transition point is calculated, and it is shown that the gain in power transfer is obtained for any battery when its equivalent circuit parameters are known. LTSpice simulations demonstrate that the transferred power can be incremented of around 30%, if compared to the case in which the rectifier works in continuous mode. This achievement is obtained by following the design recommendations proposed at the end of the paper, which trade off the gain in power transfer and the amplitude of the oscillating components of the wireless charger output.",Drone,2021
Miniature drone antenna design for the detection of airliners,"In this paper, the design of a miniature antenna dedicated to the detection of airliners through the demodulation of Automatic Dependence Surveillance-Broadcast system (ADS-B) signals is presented. This antenna is designed for being embedded on the top of a drone in order to detect and avoid collisions with airliners. This antenna consists of an array of Planar Inverted-F Antennas, a quadrature feed network (FN) and a reflector plane (RP). The FN is designed to have output signals with the same amplitude and a 90 degrees phase difference between each other. It achieves circular polarization and maintains the axial ratio of the antenna under -3 dB at the desired frequency (1.09 GHz). The antenna with the FN was manufactured and characterized. It weighs approximately 145 kg with its RP. The measured gain of the proposed antenna is about +3.7 dBi. To validate the design, the manufactured antenna was tested with a Universal Software Radio Peripheral for the processing of ADS-B signals at the French National Microwaves Days 2019 (JNM) student contest. The detection of airliners can reach up to 437 km.",Drone,2021
Simulation and assessment of battery depletion attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles for crisis management infrastructures,"The article discusses the problem of simulation and assessment of battery depletion attacks on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in crisis management systems. These devices operate in security sensitive infrastructures, thus, they are subject to accidental incidents or intentional ones performed by an attacker, such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks or sabotage accidents. The drones are particularly subject to battery depletion attacks, which exploit their autonomy, their physical movements in space, their wire and wireless communication channels, or even all together. The article classifies, first, various battery depletion attacks on an UAV and presents their analysis. Next, we describe how we adapted a Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 to the needs of a crisis management scenario by adding specific hardware control and monitoring units as well as made empirical studies on it. Simulation and experiments allowed us to confirm the feasibility of such attacks in practice, evaluate and compare their effect.",Drone,2021
A Comprehensive Review of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Attacks and Neutralization Techniques,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have revolutionized the aircraft industry in this decade. UAVs are now capable of carrying out remote sensing, remote monitoring, courier delivery, and a lot more. A lot of research is happening on making UAVs more robust using energy harvesting techniques to have a better battery lifetime, network performance and to secure against attackers. UAV networks are many times used for unmanned missions. There have been many attacks on civilian, military, and industrial targets that were carried out using remotely controlled or automated UAVs. This continued misuse has led to research in preventing unauthorized UAVs from causing damage to life and property. In this paper, we present a literature review of UAVs, UAV attacks, and their prevention using anti-UAV techniques. We first discuss the different types of UAVs, the regulatory laws for UAV activities, their use cases, recreational, and military UAV incidents. After understanding their operation, various techniques for monitoring and preventing UAV attacks are described along with case studies.",Drone,2021
Formal approach to thwart against drone discovery attacks: A taxonomy of novel 3D obfuscation mechanisms,"The pervasive capabilities and myriad of mission performance abilities of Unmanned (Combat) Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/UCAVs) have exponentially grown their deployment possibilities in the recent past. Advancements in artificial intelligence, sensing technologies and autonomous guidance, navigation and control capabilities have further fueled wide-scale deployments of UAVs, both for military and commercial applications, ranging from autonomous air taxis and cargo deliveries to intelligence surveillance, reconnaissance, and combat missions. Most of these applications consume Global Nav-igation Satellite System (GNSS) based location information for their services, which is also shared in real-time with ground control stations and centralized service operators, often using insecure communication channels. This limitation has significantly raised the location privacy concerns of aerial vehicles, deployed to conduct user-centric, safety-critical and localization-sensitive operations. A compromise of location privacy of a UAV can pose serious threats, including stalking, theft or damage of UAV/payload or even use of GNSS-guided munitions. These emerging threats call for robust and trust-worthy solutions for preserving the location privacy of aerial vehicles.This paper proposes a novel obfuscation-based mechanism to safeguard location information against privacy attacks. Our proposed solution conceals actual information by transmitting modified location parameters, either after diluting their accuracy or by fabricating deceptive trajectories for a known eavesdropper. Based on these two broad categories, defined as Attenuation and Deception based obfuscation techniques respectively, we also present a novel taxonomy of 3D obfuscation mechanisms, supported by formal descriptions of underlying operators. The operators can be used independently or in conjunction to satisfy diverse mission-specific obfuscation profiles. The proposed operators have been practically implemented and evaluated using a customizable obfuscator deployed over a Global Positioning System (GPS) guided UAV. The field experiments validate the efficacy, security and deployability of the proposed solution against location-privacy threats. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2021
Efficient radar detection of weak manoeuvring targets using a coarse-to-fine strategy,"Detection of weak manoeuvring targets has always been an important yet challenging task for radar signal processing. One primary reason is that target variable motions within a coherent processing interval generate energy migrations across multiple resolution bins, which severely deteriorate the parameter estimation performance. The problem is compounded by an increasingly complex surveillance environment, as well as more affordable and pervasive than ever small targets such as drones. In this work, a coarse-to-fine strategy for the detection of weak manoeuvring targets is designed. First, a coarse estimation of the chirp parameter in an extended unambiguous range using a novel coprime segmented discrete polynomial-phase transform is coherently integrated and derived. Sparse fractional Fourier transform is then employed to refine the coarse estimation at a significantly reduced computational complexity. The proposed scheme achieves an efficient and reliable weak target detection, while requires no a priori knowledge on the motion parameters, which is verified by the simulation results.",Drone,2021
Butterflies fly using efficient propulsive clap mechanism owing to flexible wings,"Butterflies look like no other flying animal, with unusually short, broad and large wings relative to their body size. Previous studies have suggested butterflies use several unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms to boost force production with upstroke wing clap being a prominent feature. When the wings clap together at the end of upstroke the air between the wings is pressed out, creating a jet, pushing the animal in the opposite direction. Although viewed, for the last 50 years, as a crucial mechanism in insect flight, quantitative aerodynamic measurements of the clap in freely flying animals are lacking. Using quantitative flow measurements behind freely flying butterflies during take-off and a mechanical clapper, we provide aerodynamic performance estimates for the wing clap. We show that flexible butterfly wings, forming a cupped shape during the upstroke and clap, thrust the butterfly forwards, while the downstroke is used for weight support. We further show that flexible wings dramatically increase the useful impulse (+22%) and efficiency (+28%) of the clap compared to rigid wings. Combined, our results suggest butterflies evolved a highly effective clap, which provides a mechanistic hypothesis for their unique wing morphology. Furthermore, our findings could aid the design of man-made flapping drones, boosting propulsive performance.",Drone,2021
Police Drones and the Air: Towards a volumetric geopolitics of security,"The paper explores the aerial dimension of policing and surveillance. It does so by drawing upon select results from a large-scale survey conducted in 2017 among professional (public and private) drone users in Switzerland. Focusing in particular on the police, the paper shows that the technology not only generates novel ways of looking down from above, but also of looking up from below, thus instilling a kind of air-mindedness among the police. In making the airspace explicit as an object, and stake of imaginaries, concerns and practices, drones mediate novel ways of relating to the air, understanding it, approaching it and acting in relation to it.",Drone,2021
3-D swimming microdrone powered by acoustic bubbles,"Mobile microrobots that maneuver in liquid environments and navigate inside the human body have drawn a great interest due to their possibility for medical uses serving as an in vivo cargo. For this system, the effective self-propelling method, which should be powered wirelessly and controllable in 3-D space, is of paramount importance. This article describes a bubble-powered swimming microdrone that can navigate in 3-D space in a controlled manner. To enable 3-D propulsion with steering capability, air bubbles of three lengths are trapped in microtubes that are embedded and three-dimensionally aligned inside the drone body using two-photon polymerization. These bubbles can generate on-demand 3-D propulsion through microstreaming when they are selectively excited at their individual resonance frequencies that depend on the bubble sizes. In order to equip the drone with highly stable maneuverability, a non-uniform mass distribution of the drone body is carefully designed to spontaneously restore the drone to the upright position from disturbances. A mathematical model of the restoration mechanism is developed to predict the restoration behavior showing a good agreement with the experimental data. The present swimming microdrone potentially lends itself to a robust 3-D maneuverable microscale mobile cargo navigating in vitro and in vivo for biomedical applications.",Drone,2021
Multiple objects tracking in the UAV system based on hierarchical deep high-resolution network,"Robust and high-performance visual multi-object tracking is a big challenge in computer vision, especially in a drone scenario. In this paper, an online Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) approach in the UAV system is proposed to handle small target detections and class imbalance challenges, which integrates the merits of deep high-resolution representation network and data association method in a unified framework. Specifically, while applying tracking-by-detection architecture to our tracking framework, a Hierarchical Deep High-resolution network (HDHNet) is proposed, which encourages the model to handle different types and scales of targets, and extract more effective and comprehensive features during online learning. After that, the extracted features are fed into different prediction networks for interesting targets recognition. Besides, an adjustable fusion loss function is proposed by combining focal loss and GIoU loss to solve the problems of class imbalance and hard samples. During the tracking process, these detection results are applied to an improved DeepSORT MOT algorithm in each frame, which is available to make full use of the target appearance features to match one by one on a practical basis. The experimental results on the VisDrone2019 MOT benchmark show that the proposed UAV MOT system achieves the highest accuracy and the best robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods.",Drone,2021
Modeling and Design of a Semi-Integrated QEPAS Sensor,"Quartz enhanced photo acoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) has gained a growing interest in recent years for gas sensing technology because of the high sensitivity provided by sharp resonant tuning forks (QTFs) exploited as piezoelectric sound wave detectors; and the modularity, compactness, and robustness of the sensors. The currently used experimental configurations of the QEPAS sensors still rely on free space optics, which are potentially subject to misalignment and require a relatively high space occupation. Here we propose the modelling and the design of a QEPAS sensor with the laser source and optical components for beam delivery bonded together and semi-integrated with the tuning fork. In particular, we propose a configuration in which an optical resonator placed between the prongs of the QTF is coupled with the laser source through a waveguide (OMRSI-QEPAS). For this setup design, COMSOL simulations provided pressure values of the acoustic wavefront comparable with the standard on-beam configuration employing acoustic resonator tubes. Therefore, the design here proposed aims to package the opto-acoustic core of a QEPAS sensor in a single module of few cubic centimeters to definitively address the misalignment issues and pave the way to a further level of miniaturization, integration and deployment for application like mobile and on-drone sensing.",Drone,2021
Optical-Relayed Entanglement Distribution Using Drones as Mobile Nodes,"Entanglement distribution has been accomplished using a flying drone, and this mobile platform can be generalized for multiple mobile nodes with optical relay among them. Here we develop the first optical relay to reshape the wave front of photons for their low diffraction loss in free-space transmission. Using two drones, where one distributes the entangled photons and the other serves as relay node, we achieve entanglement distribution with Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt S parameter of 2.59 +/- 0.11 at 1 km distance. Key components for entangled source, tracking, and relay are developed with high performance and are lightweight, constructing a scalable airborne system for multinode connectio and toward mobile quantum networks.",Drone,2021
DroneCells: Improving spectral efficiency using drone-mounted flying base stations,"We study a networking scenario for 5G and beyond, called DroneCells, where miniaturized base stations (BSs) are mounted on flying drones to serve mobile users. We propose that the drones never stop, and move continuously within the cell in a way that reduces the distance between the BS and the serving users, thus potentially improving the spectral efficiency of the network. By considering the practical mobility constraints of commercial drones, we design drone mobility algorithms to improve the spectral efficiency of DroneCells. We propose a range of practically realizable heuristics with varying complexity and performance. Simulations show that, using the existing consumer drones, the proposed algorithms can readily improve spectral efficiency by 34% and the 5-percentile packet throughput by 50% compared to the scenario, where drones hover over fixed locations. More significant gains can be expected with more agile drones in the future. A surprising outcome is that the drones need to fly only at minimal speeds to achieve these gains, avoiding any negative effect on drone battery lifetime. We further demonstrate that the optimal solution provides only modest improvements over the best heuristic algorithm, which employs Game Theory to make mobility decisions for drone BSs.",Drone,2021
Localization in mobile wireless sensor networks using drones,"Localization is one of the most important aspects of wireless sensor networks. Most of the localization algorithms proposed in the literature, work for static networks. However, the performance of these protocols in the mobile environment still needs to be investigated. Localization in a mobile environment may pose challenges of accuracy and computational complexity due to mobility of the nodes. In this article, we have proposed an algorithm for localization in mobile wireless sensor networks using drones (LMWSND). A drone-based algorithm is proposed to simulate the moving trajectory of the drones. The proposed drone-based algorithm uses the technique of received signal strength between the drone and unknown sensor nodes to find the distance between them. The distance thus obtained is used for localization of the unknown nodes. A new method is used to solve the system of distance equations to restrict the propagation of error. Furthermore, the mathematical analysis of the propagation error in LMWSND proves the superiority of our proposed algorithm in comparison to other algorithms. The results obtained through simulations further strengthen our conclusion that the proposed algorithm reduces the propagation of error. We have also proposed another algorithm to choose the nearby beacon points for better utilization of the network resources and to reduce the computational efforts.",Drone,2021
Mobile sensor patrol path planning in partially observable border regions,"A border surveillance operation requires sophisticated sensor planning, as sensors are usually scarce and cannot cover an entire region simultaneously. Border patrol agents act as moving sensors in a border region, and the border patrol agents' coverage moves around the region dynamically, increasing the chance of approaching a trespassing agent. Typically, the locations of trespassing agents cannot be fully observed due to the size of the border region and obstacles. In addition, intelligent trespassing agents may dynamically adjust their traveling paths so that the border patrol agents cannot predict their locations easily. Trespassing agents are assumed to leave traces that indicate their footprints, providing their estimated locations. Border patrol agents may use the trespassers' footprints as partial information to leverage patrol path planning. We propose an adaptive border patrol process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which an individual border patrol agent's decision is determined dynamically on the basis of trespassing agents' partially observed locations. The observations are shared among individual border patrol agents, allowing the border patrol agents to cooperate. The zoning technique is used to limit the planning scope of an individual border patrol agent, and Monte Carlo simulation is applied to reduce the complexity of the POMDP planning problem. Empirical experiments are conducted by means of simulated agents. The simulation parameters are derived from the interviews with a group of border patrol experts. The results in different scenarios show that the proposed patrol path planning scheme outperforms other patrol path planning schemes in terms of the trespasser detection rate. The simulation results are validated with respect to subject matter experts (SMEs), where SMEs are the same border patrol experts who had given the interviews. The proposed method has potential in border surveillance as an assisting system for human border patrol or an automated guidance system in robots or drones.",Drone,2021
Flounder-Net: An efficient CNN for crowd counting by aerial photography,"Crowd counting on aerial images using the embedded system is a challenging task, due to high-definition images, low computing power, and limited memory. To tackle this task, we propose an efficient deep learning model named Flounder-Net structured like a flounder. In the Flounder-Net, a novel interleaved group convolution is proposed to eliminate the redundancy of network, and a rapid shrink of feature maps is employed to tackle the high-resolution problem. Since we would like to investigate the case of online aerial surveillance, we use the embedded system of a drone to run our algorithm. We also use the vision system of this drone to collect a set of high-definition aerial photographs as a benchmark. Extensive experiments on existing datasets and our aerial dataset show that Flounder-Net achieves FCN-level accuracy with three types of photograph devices: handheld cameras, surveillance cameras, and drone-based cameras. Additionally, Flounder-Net has 17x fewer parameters and 20x faster speed than FCN and allows an input image with arbitrary sizes. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Drone,2021
A Computational Design Analysis of UAV's Rotor Blade in Low-Temperature Conditions for the Defence Applications,"This paper discusses about the critical situations faced by the Defence operations with drones in the area of Siachen Glacier in the Himalayas. The reasons for the structural failures in drone's rotor blades and the low-performance efficiency of the drones at low-temperature conditions are highlighted. A possible solution to the above-mentioned problems has been addressed by introducing a new boundary design in the rotor blades and composite materials. The results which are shown in this paper are obtained by the computational analysis facility located at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, School of Technology, GITAM (Deemed to be University), Hyderabad. By mimicking the Siachen Glacier atmosphere conditions, the proposed rotor blade design has been analysed in CFD.",Drone,2021
Unknown network attack detection based on open-set recognition and active learning in drone network,"With the technical support of 5G, the drone network plays a critical role in the autonomous and digital era. However, due to wireless and autonomy characteristics, the drone network is prone to diverse malicious attacks, so it's vital to deploy network intrusion detection system to detect network attacks. For a real open drone network environment, unknown attacks will occur constantly, but the existing intrusion detection methods are usually designed for a static and closed-set scenario and will fail to recognize the unknown attacks correctly, threatening the security of drone network. Therefore, we design an intrusion detection system to detect unknown network attacks in the drone network. Based on open-set recognition, we propose the Open-CNN model to implement intrusion detection and detect unknown attacks. Further to detect unknown attacks, we also propose an active learning (AL) approach for unknown attacks based on the least confidence query strategy, allowing the intrusion detection model to learn efficiently from the unknown attack instances detected by Open-CNN at small labeling budgets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Open-CNN in detecting unknown attacks, with the accuracy improvement of 9% to 30% over the compared methods, and the proposed AL approach achieves good performance when retraining with only 1% of labeled unknown attack samples.",Drone,2021
Performing thermodynamic analysis by simulating the general characteristics of the two-spool turbojet engine suitable for drone and UAV propulsion,"This study presents determining performance parameters as well as thermodynamic analysis through certain design parameters of a two-spool turbojet engine for utilizing as propulsion equipment in drones and UAVs. The general characteristics of the two-spool turbojet engine and the thermodynamic analysis outcomes that are the subject of the study guide the engine designers, scientists and researchers interested in this subject to measure the available energy level depending on the entropy generation level of the energy conversion system and to determine the exergy destructions in the components defined as sub-systems. The outcomes show that while the thrust of the engine is computed to be 516 daN, the thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) rate and air-fuel ratio corresponding to the 4398.499 kW-fuel energy consumption rate of the designed turbojet engine were determined as 19.706 g kN(-1) s(-1) and 82.604, respectively. When considering the thermodynamic analysis, performance cycle and general characteristics of a two-spool turbojet engine in accordance with the design requirements, the focus should be on the combustion chamber component to improve the first law and second law efficiency ratios. Any innovation in the burner of the two-spool turbojet engine over the course of the design stage may mitigate the exergy generation rate. In particular for designers and researchers, it would be advantageous to optimize parametric engine design metrics with respect to thermodynamic analysis and performance results.",Drone,2021

An Optimal Three-Dimensional Drone Layout Method for Maximum Signal Coverage and Minimum Interference in Complex Pipeline Networks.,"In daily pipeline inspection, it is significant to ensure good network communication and security. With the development of drone technology, it is possible to apply drones as air routers to collect information from pipeline networks and transmit it to pipeline inspectors. It is also crucial to achieve optimal drone deployment in pipeline networks. This article proposes a two-phase evolution optimal 3-D drone layout algorithm to deploy drones in pipeline networks. First, a 3-D pipeline graph model is designed to represent the possible projection position of drones, and the objective function is proposed for optimal drone deployment. Then, in the first phase, based on the features of the 3-D pipeline graph, the drone flight rules and constraint conditions are presented to calculate the number of drones and the initial layout sequence. In the second phase, according to the objective function and the above results, every drone is continuously moved in a small area to achieve a tradeoff between signal coverage and interference. Moreover, the key parameters of the objective function can be discussed to further optimize drone deployment. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithm.",Drone,2021
Dynamic ambient HetNet for hybrid data communication and transmission in IoT networks,"In this manuscript, the Dynamic ambient HetNet for hybrid data communication and transmission in IoT networks is proposed. The lodging of colossal devices and their linkages in and beyond 5th generations (5G) has obtained a great deal of studies from academia and business. In the macro hotspot field, the uses of emerging Device-to-device (D2D), Light Fidelity (LiFi), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and Drones can't simply cross the paths of transient network support prerequisites. Environmental interaction is an optional way to efficiently reduce this problem through the provision of urgent connections among limited-power servers. In addition, the effectiveness of transmission relies on parameters and range from factors like signal form, Radio frequency (RF) origin and the atmosphere, i.e. indoor or outdoor. The proposed Dynamic Ambient HetNet architecture both indoors and outdoors, where a source node is connected to the target node via radio frequency-powered relays to increases network coverage and enhance the efficiency of mobile devices either within the macro hot spot region or during the disaster area like hurricanes. This method can exploit the Wireless interweave down-convert up-convert protocol with energy-collection capacity for simultaneous information and power transfer. During the propagation from the origin node, radio frequency-powered relay can monitor hybrid data broadcasts, owing to its full duplex features. The efficiency assessment in MATLAB demonstrates the traditional models for radio frequency relay in hybrid communication. Moreover, we endow with the challenges in relation to the ambient backscatter communication network. The experimental results proved that the proposed method is better in terms of power factor and throughput gives 90%, ratio for the uplink and down link in terms of cell load has obtained 75%, and packet throughput in terms of speed has the value of 93%.",Drone,2021

Energy Efficient Placement of a Drone Base Station for Minimum Required Transmit Power,"Drone stations (DBSs) can provide wireless coverage on the ground. This letter investigates the optimal DBS deployment to achieve energy efficient wireless coverage. We formulate a problem to minimize the average transmit power of a DBS that serves a set of ground users. We firstly consider a case where the DBS transmits signals to each user with an equal power. In this case, we propose a decoupling-based placement algorithm to obtain the optimal DBS location. For the case without allocating the equal transmit power to each user, we further propose a DBS placement algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Simulation results show that increasing the drone altitude can obtain the line-of-sight (LoS) propagation advantage of the AtG link, which results in the power savings by our proposed algorithms. The case without assuming the equal transmit power to each user enjoys the lowest average transmit power.",Drone,2020
Analyzing Some Elements of Technological Singularity Using Regression Methods,"Technological advancement has contributed immensely to human life and society. Technologies like industrial robots, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are advancing at a rapid pace. While the evolution of Artificial Intelligence has contributed significantly to the development of personal assistants, automated drones, smart home devices, etc., it has also raised questions about the much-anticipated point in the future where machines may develop intelligence that may be equal to or greater than humans, a term that is popularly known as Technological Singularity. Although technological singularity promises great benefits, past research works on Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems going rogue highlight the downside of Technological Singularity and assert that it may lead to catastrophic effects. Thus, there is a need to identify factors that contribute to technological advancement and may ultimately lead to Technological Singularity in the future.

Component identification and defect detection in transmission lines based on deep learning,"Ensuring the stable and safe operation of the power system is an important work of the national power grid companies. The power grid company has established a special power inspection department to troubleshoot transmission line components and replace faulty components in a timely manner. At present, assisted manual inspection by drone inspection has become a trend of power line inspection. Automatically identifying component failures from images of UAV aerial transmission lines is a cutting-edge cross-cutting issue. Based on the above problems, the purpose of this article is to study the component identification and defect detection of transmission lines based on deep learning. This paper expands the dataset by adjusting the size of the convolution kernel of the CNN model and the rotation transformation of the image. The experimental results show that both methods can effectively improve the effectiveness and reliability of component identification and defect detection in transmission line inspection. The recognition and classification experiments were performed using the images collected by the drone. The experimental results show that the effectiveness and reliability of the deep learning method in the identification and defect detection of high-voltage transmission line components are very high. Faster R-CNN performs component identification and defect detection. The detection can reach a recognition speed of nearly 0.17 s per sheet, the recognition rate of the pressure-equalizing ring can reach 96.8%, and the mAP can reach 93.72%.",Drone,2021
"Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in urban search and rescue-methodology, capacity development, and integration.","This paper's purpose is to establish a methodological basis for using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in urban search and rescue (USAR). Modern USAR operations involve the location, rescue (extrication), and initial medical stabilization of individuals trapped in confined spaces or places with complicated access, eg, high structures. As a part of the ongoing modernization process, this paper explores possible options for UAV utilization in USAR operations. Today, UAV are already taking part in support emergency operations all over the world, and possible forms of operation for UAV in USAR environment can be in two primary modes: on-site and logistic chain. The on-site mode includes various capabilities of multilayer UAV array, mostly based on enhanced visual capabilities to create situational awareness and to speed-up search and rescue (SAR) process including using nanodrones for entering into confined places, ventilation ducts, and underground sewer channels can give to rescue teams' opportunities to have eyes within ruins even before initial clearing process. Cargo drones will be able to bring equipment directly to high floors or roadless areas in comparison to wheeled transportation. The advantages of cargo drones operation are the ability of autonomous flight based on GPS or homing beacon and ability to provide logistics supports with-out involving additional personnel and vehicles and with no dependence on road conditions.",Drone,2021
Understanding the Behavior of Data-Driven Inertial Odometry With Kinematics-Mimicking Deep Neural Network,"In navigation, deep learning for inertial odometry (IO) has recently been investigated using data from a low-cost IMU only. The measurement of noise, bias, and some errors from which IO suffers is estimated with a deep neural network (DNN) to achieve more accurate pose estimation. While numerous studies on the subject highlighted the performances of their approach, the behavior of data-driven IO with DNN has not been clarified. Therefore, this paper presents a quantitative analysis of kinematics-mimicking DNN-based IO from various aspects. First, the new network architecture is designed to mimic the kinematics and ensure comprehensive analyses. Next, the hyper-parameters of neural networks that are highly correlated to IO are identified. Besides, their role in the performances is investigated. In the evaluation, the analyses were conducted with publicly-available IO datasets for vehicles and drones. The results are introduced to highlight the remaining problems in IO and are considered a guideline to promote further research.",Drone,2021

Optimizing Sector Ring Histogram of Oriented Gradients for human injured detection from drone images,"Developing a system for emergency response and rescue to find injured people within images has been an interest to many researchers. The key challenge is to define a proper feature to describe the human body's appearance. Various features are often extracted from low-level data, such as texture and colour (Zhang et al., Sensors. 19(5):1005, 2020). One of the strong features is the Sector Ring Histogram of Oriented Gradients (SRHOG) that has been successfully applied to human detection tasks. Despite good accuracy in finding humans, an SRHOG detection method produces a large amount of false-negative labels. Locating an injured body after a disaster in drone images using an imaging camera remained a challenge. This study presents a new extension to SRHOG, so-called AdSRHOG, to reduce the number of false labels. In our approach, the gradient filters used by SRHOG defined adaptively depending on the corresponding pixel location The proposed feature was used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to detect humans on drone images. The experiments showed a significant improvement of up to 54.3% in reducing the false labels. It was also found that the overall accuracy of the human detection process had a notable improvement of 13.1% over a traditional SRHOG detection technique.",Drone,2021
Uniform Dispersal of Cheap Flying Robots in the Presence of Obstacles,"In previous solutions, the authors considered the uniform dispersal problem (or Filling problem) in which inexpensive robots had to disperse in order to cover an a priori not known area, as well as they also examined the possibilities of solving the Filling in two-dimensional regions. The swarm entities had to collectively solve a common task using the simplified cognitive abilities of the robots (i.e., their memory, visibility, and communication capabilities were restricted). In this paper, the authors investigate the possibilities to apply the method for three-dimensional regions. The need for such a solution emerged, as nowadays the number of low-priced flying robots, e.g., quadcopters, drones, has increased heavily. The main research direction is to minimize the hardware requirements of these robots, as doing so is crucial in order to maintain their cost-efficiency. The authors demonstrate that it is still possible to solve the Filling problem in three-dimensional space in the presence of obstacles, while the robots maintain the following hardware requirements: they have a constant amount of memory, minimal visibility, as well as there is no communication between them, and the algorithm terminates in linear runtime. Finally, simulations were carried out to prove the theoretical results.",Drone,2021
Performance Verification of a Target Tracking System With a Laser Rangefinder,"A target tracking system with a laser rangefinder is developed, and the performance of the developed system is verified by a numerical simulation and field tests. To develop the target tracking system, appropriate coordinate systems, motion models, and estimation methods are selected, and a range filter is designed to compensate for the measurement errors of the laser rangefinder. The range filter independently processes the range measurements so that the target filter continuously produces the target information. The entire target tracking system development process is described in detail to facilitate future work of a similar nature. A scenario-based Monte Carlo simulation is performed to compare the performances of various state estimation methods. Experimental tests involving a low-speed fishing boat and a drone are performed to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. A separate performance analysis program with a graphical user interface is developed to analyze the simulation and field test results.",Drone,2021
An Edge Assisted Secure Lightweight Authentication Technique for Safe Communication on the Internet of Drones Network,"Security and privacy are among the most critical challenges on the internet of drones (IoD) network. The communication entities of the IoD network can communicate securely with the use of authenticated key agreement (AKA) based techniques. However, the design of such techniques must balance the tradeoff between security and lightweight features. Recently, Chen et al. proposed an authentication and key sharing scheme for IoD deployment. It is, however, realized after scrutiny that the proposed technique is vulnerable to security attacks under the well-accepted Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary model. Moreover, the scheme applies to the IoD network with only one drones' flying zone. To solve these challenges, this paper proposed a secure lightweight proven authenticated key agreement (SLPAKA) technique for IoD deployment. The technique is free from all the problems identified in the scheme of Chen et al. To ensure the reliability of the SLPAKA, the security of the technique has been assessed from a theoretical method and formal way using the ProVerif cryptographic protocol verification tool. Apart from comparing the performance of SLPAKA with the benchmarking schemes in terms of security, computational cost, and communication cost, the SLPAKA and the technique proposed by Chen et al. are implemented using a python programming language to evaluate and compare their performance in terms of energy consumption and computational time metrics. The results show that the SLPAKA outperforms the technique of Chen et al. and all the other benchmarking techniques in terms of security and lightweight features.",Drone,2021
A Novel Neural Network Model Applied to Modeling of a Tandem-Wing Quadplane Drone,"This research focuses on modeling one of the Quadplane flight phases: a hover state, similar to a regular Quadcopter hovering. The process is highly non-linear, and additionally, there are more phenomena to take into account - it is related to air turbulence around the wings and the fuselage. This work thoroughly studies the effectiveness of various types of neural networks to model the drone using the data recorded from real free-flight experiments. Finally, we introduce a novel type of neural-based model: the Feature-Sequence-To-Sequence (fseq2seq) Recurrent Neural Network Model. The new Model has interesting features: the input-data-driven initialization of RNN's internal states and a simplification of the input layer (significant reduction of used neurons' weights). We demonstrate that the new network outperforms all classic model types.",Drone,2021
Intuitive Robot Teleoperation Through Multi-Sensor Informed Mixed Reality Visual Aids,"Mobile robotic systems have evolved to include sensors capable of truthfully describing robot status and operating environment as accurately and reliably as never before. This possibility is challenged by effective sensor data exploitation, because of the cognitive load an operator is exposed to, due to the large amount of data and time-dependency constraints. This paper addresses this challenge in remote-vehicle teleoperation by proposing an intuitive way to present sensor data to users by means of using mixed reality and visual aids within the user interface. We propose a method for organizing information presentation and a set of visual aids to facilitate visual communication of data in teleoperation control panels. The resulting sensor-information presentation appears coherent and intuitive, making it easier for an operator to catch and comprehend information meaning. This increases situational awareness and speeds up decision-making. Our method is implemented on a real mobile robotic system operating outdoor equipped with on-board internal and external sensors, GPS, and a reconstructed 3D graphical model provided by an assistant drone. Experimentation verified feasibility while intuitive and comprehensive visual communication was confirmed through an assessment, which encourages further developments.",Drone,2021
"Comparative design, hydrodynamic analysis, and physical performance of fish-like robots","Biological aquatic animals are turned to for design inspiration of marine drones because of their efficient long-range performance and high agility in the water. Investigations of body caudal fin biological shapes from the Carangiform, Subcarangiform, and Thunniform categories are compared to widely used symmetric airfoils to determine shape performance. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic results using four solution methods are examined to analyze these hydrofoils at decreasing aspect ratios with a constant wing chord length. This numerical investigation results in the selection of the Subcarangiform hydrofoil to be used in the physical design of a fish-like bio-inspired drone. These hydrodynamic results are utilized to adapt a fish-like aquatic unmanned vehicle from conceptual design to working prototype that is tested in a mission environment. Parameters for buoyancy and stability are then defined to give guidance during the physical design phase. Quantities for weight and volume could be extrapolated and used to determine the need for ballast in the system. The final prototype system is tested in its mission environment. It accomplishes turns at a body length to turn radius ratio of 1:1, at a swim velocity of 1.5 body lengths per second. This system's real-world performance is compared to that of other systems.",Drone,2021
Energy-Efficient and Fast Data Collection in UAV-Aided Wireless Sensor Networks for Hilly Terrains,"Energy-constrained sensor nodes are often deployed in remote, hilly, and hard-to-reach areas for civilian and military purposes. In such wireless sensor networks (WSNs), an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be used to collect data from the sensor nodes. Low-altitude UAVs can be utilized to reduce the energy consumption of WSNs by optimizing the data collection position. In this study, we designed an energy-efficient and fast data collection (EFDC) scheme in UAV-aided WSNs for hilly areas with the help of a UAV as a data mule. First, we proposed a central bias hybrid energy-efficient distributed clustering algorithm for grouping the sensors. Then, we applied a modified tabu search algorithm to optimize the UAV position for collecting data from a cluster. To achieve fast data collection, we developed the traveling salesman problem with the derived data collection positions and solved it by applying a modified genetic algorithm. Based on our simulation results, the proposed EFDC scheme outperforms the conventional ones in terms of energy consumption, scalability, control overhead, delay, and load balancing.",Drone,2021
Feedback Linearized Optimal Control Design for Quadrotor With Multi-Performances,"Design of tracking controller for quadrotor is an important issue for many engineering fields such as COVID-19 epidemic prevention, intelligent agriculture, military photography and rescue nowadays. This study applies the feedback linearized method and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) method using particle swarm optimization (PSO) to analysis and stabilize the highly nonlinear quadrotor system without applying any nonlinear function approximator that includes neural network approach and fuzzy approach. The article proposes a new method based on the firstly proposed convergence rate formula to achieve the optimal weighting matrices of LQR such that the composite controller can reduce the amplitudes of system control inputs. Determination of the LQR tuning parameters is conventionally achieved via trial and error approach. In addition to being very troublesome, it is difficult to find the globally best tuning matrices with LQR method. This article firstly uses the convergence rate formula of the nonlinear system as the fitness function of LQR approach by using PSO to take the place of the trial and error method. The generalities and implications of proposed approach are globally valid, whereas the Jacobian linearized approach is locally valid due to the Taylor expansion theorem. In addition to these two major achievements, the significant innovation of the proposed method is to possess ""simultaneously"" additional performances including the almost disturbance decoupling, input amplitude reduction, tuning parameter optimization and globally exponential stability performances. Comparative examples show that the convergence rate with our proposed optimal controller using the PSO algorithm is larger than the fuzzy method, and better than the singular perturbation method with high-gain feedback.",Drone,2021
LSTM and Filter Based Comparison Analysis for Indoor Global Localization in UAVs,"Deep learning (DL) based localization and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has recently gained considerable attention demonstrating remarkable results. Instead of constructing hand-crafted algorithms through geometric theories, DL based solutions provide a data-driven solution to the problem. Taking advantage of large amounts of training data and computing capacity, these approaches are increasingly developing into a new field that offers accurate and robust localization systems. In this work, the problem of global localization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is analyzed by proposing a sequential, end-to-end, and multimodal deep neural network based monocular visual-inertial localization framework. More specifically, the proposed neural network architecture is three-fold; a visual feature extractor convNet network, a small IMU integrator bi-directional long short-term memory (LSTM), and a global pose regressor bi-directional LSTM network for pose estimation. In addition, by fusing the traditional IMU filtering methods instead of LSTM with the convNet, a more time-efficient deep pose estimation framework is presented. It is worth pointing out that the focus in this study is to evaluate the precision and efficiency of visual-inertial (VI) based localization approaches concerning indoor scenarios. The proposed deep global localization is compared with the various state-of-the-art algorithms on indoor UAV datasets, simulation environments and real-world drone experiments in terms of accuracy and time-efficiency. In addition, the comparison of IMU-LSTM and IMU-Filter based pose estimators is also provided by a detailed analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed filter-based approach combined with a DL approach has promising performance in terms of accuracy and time efficiency in indoor localization of UAVs.",Drone,2021
Flight Model Using Voronoi Tessellation for a Delay-Tolerant Wireless Relay Network Using Drones,"In this article, we consider a wireless relay network using drones as a temporary communication system in a large-scale disaster area. We assume that insufficient drones are present to maintain a wireless connection, and we apply a delay-tolerant network to this system. In this system, information is transmitted by wireless transmission between drones and their movement, and as the delivery delay mainly depends on the latter, the movement pattern of the drones, which we call a flight model, is of great importance. We utilize coverage control to handle the deployment of multiple drones and propose a novel flight model of drones using Voronoi tessellation. In the proposed model, we calculate the Voronoi cell using the predicted positions of some drones, and we associate weights with those positions to utilize the weighted Voronoi cell. Through simulation, we evaluate the relationship among the weight decay method, distribution and movement of drones, and delay characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed flight model achieves better delay characteristics by setting appropriate weights compared to a previous flight model.",Drone,2021
Selecting Informative Data Samples for Model Learning Through Symbolic Regression,"Continual model learning for nonlinear dynamic systems, such as autonomous robots, presents several challenges. First, it tends to be computationally expensive as the amount of data collected by the robot quickly grows in time. Second, the model accuracy is impaired when data from repetitive motions prevail in the training set and outweigh scarcer samples that also capture interesting properties of the system. It is not known in advance which samples will be useful for model learning. Therefore, effective methods need to be employed to select informative training samples from the continuous data stream collected by the robot. Existing literature does not give any guidelines as to which of the available sample-selection methods are suitable for such a task. In this paper, we compare five sample-selection methods, including a novel method using the model prediction error. We integrate these methods into a model learning framework based on symbolic regression, which allows for learning accurate models in the form of analytic equations. Unlike the currently popular data-hungry deep learning methods, symbolic regression is able to build models even from very small training data sets. We demonstrate the approach on two real robots: the TurtleBot mobile robot and the Parrot Bebop drone. The results show that an accurate model can be constructed even from training sets as small as 24 samples. Informed sample-selection techniques based on prediction error and model variance clearly outperform uninformed methods, such as sequential or random selection.",Drone,2021
"Communication and Consensus Co-Design for Distributed, Low-Latency, and Reliable Wireless Systems","Designing distributed, fast, and reliable wireless consensus protocols is instrumental in enabling mission-critical decentralized systems, such as robotic networks in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), drone swarms in rescue missions, and so forth. However, chasing both low-latency and reliability of consensus protocols is a challenging task. The problem is aggravated under wireless connectivity that may be slower and less reliable, compared to wired connections. To tackle this issue, we investigate fundamental relationships between consensus latency and reliability through the lens of wireless connectivity, and co-design communication and consensus protocols for low-latency and reliable decentralized systems. Specifically, we propose a novel communication-efficient distributed consensus protocol, termed random representative consensus (R2C), and show its effectiveness under gossip and broadcast communication protocols. To this end, we derive a closed-form end-to-end (E2E) latency expression of the R2C that guarantees target reliability, and compare it with a baseline consensus protocol, referred to as referendum consensus (RC). The result shows that the R2C is faster compared to the RC and more reliable compared when co-designed with the broadcast protocol compared to that with the gossip protocol.",Drone,2021
Time-Aggregation-Based Lossless Video Encoding for Neuromorphic Vision Sensor Data,"Dynamic vision sensors (DVSs) are emerging neuromorphic visual capturing devices, with great advantages in terms of low-power consumption, wide dynamic range, and high temporal resolution in diverse applications, such as autonomous driving, robotics, tactile sensing, and drones. The capturing method results in lower data rates than conventional video. Still, such data can be further compressed. Recent research has shown great benefits of temporal data aggregation on event-based vision data utilization. According to recent results, time aggregation of DVS data not only reduces the data rate but improves classification and object detection accuracy. In this work, we propose a compression strategy, time-aggregation-based lossless video encoding for neuromorphic vision sensor data (TALVEN), which utilizes temporal data aggregation, arrangement of the data in a specific format and lossless video encoding techniques to achieve high compression ratios. The detailed experimental analysis on outdoor and indoor datasets shows that our proposed strategy achieves superior compression ratios than the best state-of-the-art strategies.",Drone,2021
Fast Depth Prediction and Obstacle Avoidance on a Monocular Drone Using Probabilistic Convolutional Neural Network,"Recent studies employ advanced deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for monocular depth perception, which can hardly run efficiently on small drones that rely on low/middle-grade GPU(e.g. TX2 and 1050Ti) for computation. In addition, the methods which can effectively and efficiently produce probabilistic depth prediction with a measure of model confidence have not been well studied. The lack of such a method could yield erroneous, sometimes fatal, decisions in drone applications (e.g. selecting a waypoint in a region with a large depth yet a low estimation confidence). This paper presents a real-time onboard approach for monocular depth prediction and obstacle avoidance with a lightweight probabilistic CNN (pCNN), which will be ideal for use in a lightweight energy-efficient drone. For each video frame, our pCNN can efficiently predict its depth map and the corresponding confidence. The accuracy of our lightweight pCNN is greatly boosted by integrating sparse depth estimation from a visual odometry into the network for guiding dense depth and confidence inference. The estimated depth map is transformed into Ego Dynamic Space (EDS) by embedding both dynamic motion constraints of a drone and the confidence values into the spatial depth map. Traversable waypoints are automatically computed in EDS based on which appropriate control inputs for the drone are produced. Extensive experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our depth prediction method runs at 12Hz and 45Hz on TX2 and 1050Ti GPU respectively, which is 1.8X similar to 5.6X faster than the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better depth estimation accuracy. We also conducted experiments of obstacle avoidance in both simulated and real environments to demonstrate the superiority of our method to the baseline methods.",Drone,2021
Self-Corrective Sensor Fusion for Drone Positioning in Indoor Facilities,"Drones may be more advantageous than fixed cameras for quality control applications in industrial facilities, since they can be redeployed dynamically and adjusted to production planning. The practical scenario that has motivated this paper, image acquisition with drones in a car manufacturing plant, requires drone positioning accuracy in the order of 5 cm. During repetitive manufacturing processes, it is assumed that quality control imaging drones will follow highly deterministic periodic paths, stop at predefined points to take images and send them to image recognition servers. Therefore, by relying on prior knowledge about production chain schedules, it is possible to optimize the positioning technologies for the drones to stay at all times within the boundaries of their flight plans, which will be composed of stopping points and the paths in between. This involves mitigating issues such as temporary blocking of line-of-sight between the drone and any existing radio beacons; sensor data noise; and the loss of visual references. We present a self-corrective solution for this purpose. It corrects visual odometer readings based on filtered and clustered Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) data, as an alternative to direct Kalman fusion. The approach combines the advantages of these technologies when at least one of them works properly at any measurement spot. It has three method components: independent Kalman filtering, data association by means of stream clustering and mutual correction of sensor readings based on the generation of cumulative correction vectors. The approach is inspired by the observation that UWB positioning works reasonably well at static spots whereas visual odometer measurements reflect straight displacements correctly but can underestimate their length. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the approach in the application scenario over Kalman fusion, in terms of stopping point detection and trajectory estimation error.",Drone,2021
Stability Guarantees for Translational Thrust-Propelled Vehicles Dynamics Through NMPC Designs,"We propose two different nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) schemes (with and without terminal cost and constraints) for stabilizing the translational dynamics of thrust-propelled vehicles. Both approaches make use of an elaborated nonlinear feedback linearization controller and its associated ellipsoidal invariant set under restrictive input constraints, hence guaranteeing the closed-loop asymptotic stability. The terminal constraint set of the corresponding NMPC design is easy to tune due to its clear formulation expressed directly in terms of the tuning variables, while for the NMPC scheme without terminal constraint, the design allows to stabilize the system with a significantly shorter prediction horizon in comparison with the existing method in the literature. Simulation and experimental tests over a nano-drone platform validate the proposed approaches.",Drone,2021
On Analyzing Routing Selection for Aerial Autonomous Vehicles Connected to Mobile Network,"This paper proposes a two-phase algorithm for multi-criteria selection of packet forwarding in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), which communicate with the control station through commercial mobile network. The selection of proper data forwarding in the two radio link: From UAV to the antenna and from the antenna to the control station, are independent but subject to constrains. The proposed approach is independent of the intra-domain forwarding, so it may be useful for a number of different scenarios of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles connectivity (e.g., a swarm of drones). In the implementation developed in this paper, the connection is served by three different mobile network operators in order to ensure reliable connectivity. The proposed algorithm makes use of Machine Learning tools that are properly trained for predicting the behavior of the link connectivity during the flight duration. The results presented in the last section validate the algorithm and the training process of the machines.",Drone,2021
Development of Non Expensive Technologies for Precise Maneuvering of Completely Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In this paper, solutions for precise maneuvering of an autonomous small (e.g., 350-class) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are designed and implemented from smart modifications of non expensive mass market technologies. The considered class of vehicles suffers from light load, and, therefore, only a limited amount of sensors and computing devices can be installed on-board. Then, to make the prototype capable of moving autonomously along a fixed trajectory, a ""cyber-pilot"", able on demand to replace the human operator, has been implemented on an embedded control board. This cyber-pilot overrides the commands thanks to a custom hardware signal mixer. The drone is able to localize itself in the environment without ground assistance by using a camera possibly mounted on a 3 Degrees Of Freedom (DOF) gimbal suspension. A computer vision system elaborates the video stream pointing out land markers with known absolute position and orientation. This information is fused with accelerations from a 6-DOF Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to generate a ""virtual sensor"" which provides refined estimates of the pose, the absolute position, the speed and the angular velocities of the drone. Due to the importance of this sensor, several fusion strategies have been investigated. The resulting data are, finally, fed to a control algorithm featuring a number of uncoupled digital PID controllers which work to bring to zero the displacement from the desired trajectory.",Drone,2021
Analysis and Evaluation of Ramp Metering: From Historical Evolution to the Application of New Algorithms and Engineering Principles,"In the modern era, characterized by intense urbanization and frequent travel between interconnected communities, the constant expansion of cities, associated with high densities and growing need for traveling, has led to a significant increase in road traffic volumes. More than ever, road traffic today requires effort to be managed effectively in order to improve performance and safety conditions, given the greater probability of unpleasant events such as accidents or road congestion with related delays and the increased stress levels of the user and infrastructure. Fortunately, there are already various engineering tools, such as ramp metering, that can be used for this purpose. Ramp metering allows for achieving the aforementioned desired benefits, including improving mobility, reliability, efficiency, and safety, and even reducing environmental impact. It also has been shown to be cost-effective from the existing literature. Further research will be necessary to strengthen the quality, efficacy, and efficiency of ramp metering, especially considering the fast-paced progress in technology (e.g., connected autonomous vehicles and drones used for surveys) and new challenging scenarios (e.g., congested industrial areas and emergency vehicles). This review's scope is to present a general overview of principal ramp metering solutions, focusing on current research studies in the last couple of years and highlighting some of the main algorithms used for this purpose, depending on diverse scenarios. With this article, the authors desire to present the subject of ramp metering, providing a general overview of its story, evolution, and recent analytical models.",Drone,2021
A Self-Diagnosis Method for Detecting UAV Cyber Attacks Based on Analysis of Parameter Changes,"We consider how to protect Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing attacks to provide safe navigation. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used for locating drones and is by far the most popular navigation solution. This is because of the simplicity and relatively low cost of this technology, as well as the accuracy of the transmitted coordinates. Nevertheless, there are many security threats to GPS navigation. These are primarily related to the nature of the GPS signal, as an intruder can jam and spoof the GPS signal. We discuss methods of protection against this type of attack and have developed an experimental stand and conducted scenarios of attacks on a drone's GPS system. Data from the UAV's flight log were collected and analyzed in order to see the attack's impact on sensor readings. From this we identify a new method for detecting UAV anomalies by analyzing changes in internal parameters of the UAV. This self-diagnosis method allows a UAV to independently assess the presence of changes in its own subsystems indicative of cyber attacks.",Drone,2021
Registering Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Videos in the Long Term,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a very popular way of acquiring video within contexts such as remote data acquisition or surveillance. Unfortunately, their viewpoint is often unstable, which tends to impact the automatic processing of their video flux negatively. To counteract the effects of an inconsistent viewpoint, two video processing strategies are classically adopted, namely registration and stabilization, which tend to be affected by distinct issues, namely jitter and drifting. Following our prior work, we suggest that the motion estimators used in both situations can be modeled to take into account their inherent errors. By acknowledging that drifting and jittery errors are of a different nature, we propose a combination that is able to limit their influence and build a hybrid solution for jitter-free video registration. In this work, however, our modeling was restricted to 2D-rigid transforms, which are rather limited in the case of airborne videos. In the present paper, we extend and refine the theoretical ground of our previous work. This addition allows us to show how to practically adapt our previous work to perspective transforms, which our study shows to be much more accurate for this problem. A lightweight implementation enables us to automatically register stationary UAV videos in real time. Our evaluation includes traffic surveillance recordings of up to 2 h and shows the potential of the proposed approach when paired with background subtraction tasks.",Drone,2021
Modeling and Performance Analysis of Opportunistic Link Selection for UAV Communication,"In anticipation of wide implementation of 5G technologies, the scarcity of spectrum resources for the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communication remains one of the major challenges in arranging safe drone operations. Dynamic spectrum management among multiple UAVs as a tool that is able to address this issue, requires integrated solutions with considerations of heterogeneous link types and support of the multi-UAV operations. This paper proposes a synthesized resource allocation and opportunistic link selection (RA-OLS) scheme for the air-to-ground (A2G) UAV communication with dynamic link selections. The link opportunities using link hopping sequences (LHSs) are allocated in the GCSs for alleviating the internal collisions within the UAV network, offloading the on-board computations in the spectrum processing function, and avoiding the contention in the air. In this context, exclusive technical solutions are proposed to form the prototype system. A sub-optimal allocation method based on the greedy algorithm is presented for addressing the resource allocation problem. A mathematical model of the RA-OLS throughput with above propositions is formulated for the spectrum dense and scarce environments. An interference factor is introduced to measure the protection effects on the primary users. The proposed throughput model approximates the simulated communication under requirements of small errors in the spectrum dense environment and the spectrum scarce environment, where the sensitivity analysis is implemented. The proposed RA-OLS outperforms the static communication scheme in terms of the utilization rate by over 50% in case when multiple links are available. It also enables the collaborative communication when the spectral resources are in scarcity. The impacts from diverse parameters on the RA-OLS communication performance are analyzed.",Drone,2021
Analysis of Drone Assisted Network Coded Cooperation for Next Generation Wireless Network,"In this paper, use of drone as a relay node in Network Coded Cooperation (NCC) for upcoming wireless networks is proposed to achieve additional diversity as well as improve throughput. Unlike static relay cases, in drone assisted scenarios, better performance can be achieved simply by changing the position of relay. In order to quantify the network performance in drone assisted NCC, analytical closed form expression of outage probability has been calculated using two approaches namely, Analytical and Semi-analytical. Using a generalized system model, Probability Density Function (PDF) of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the path from source to destination via drone (relay) is derived. Closed form expression for outage probability in absence of direct link is also investigated. By analyzing Analog Network Coding (ANC) noise, statistical parameters of variance of ANC-noise have been obtained. Analytical findings have been verified through extensive simulations using MATLAB. Effects of drone height on system performance is also investigated through simulations. Framework presented here can be useful while analysing networks having resource constraint devices. PDF of SNR of relay path can be utilized for performing diversity calculations. Two outage expressions derived may be useful in determining system parameters for achieving any particular Quality of Service (QoS) in next generation wireless networks. Valuable insights obtained through the analysis of optimum height of drone are conducive while deploying the nodes in deterministic fashion for NCC.",Drone,2021
Applied flight dynamics modeling and stability analysis of a nonlinear time-periodic mono-wing aerial vehicle,"This paper presents fly-ability, trim-ability, stability, and control ability of a mono-wing aerial vehicle as an under-actuated multi-body system. A nonlinear mathematical model of this vehicle with translational and rotational movements is developed. Based on early simulations, a conceptual prototype of the monowing is initially designed and constructed. A comprehensive nonlinear simulation is then performed by modeling aerodynamic forces and moments using the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory. Modeling and simulation are validated against experimental data to satisfy research needs. Twenty-three efficient dynamic parameters of the mono-wing are studied in ninety-seven simulation scenarios. Robustness against external disturbances in various trim conditions is examined. Flight test experiments reveal not only fly-ability but also high attitude stability in hovering-climb flight despite the imprecise model. This vehicle has a complex dynamic behavior that urges precise identification to reach stable flight performance. The model helps to achieve a deeper understanding of the flight characteristics of such vehicles. Wing area and incidence angle, position vectors of the aerodynamic center and rotation center, and the moment of inertia tensors are identified to be the most significant parameters on the flight stability of this vehicle. It is observed that the mono-wing has multiple trim conditions and is robust against external disturbances regardless of the control surfaced deflection, the center of gravity position, or even the wing geometry, because of the rotational stability and aerodynamic performance. Moreover, it is found both by simulation and experiment that although this vehicle is not full-state controllable and observable, it can be stabilized and guided to follow the desired trajectory and perform complex flight maneuvers.

A Global-Local Self-Adaptive Network for Drone-View Object Detection,"Directly benefiting from the deep learning methods, object detection has witnessed a great performance boost in recent years. However, drone-view object detection remains challenging for two main reasons: (1) Objects of tiny-scale with more blurs w.r.t. ground-view objects offer less valuable information towards accurate and robust detection; (2) The unevenly distributed objects make the detection inefficient, especially for regions occupied by crowded objects. Confronting such challenges, we propose an end-to-end global-local self-adaptive network (GLSAN) in this paper. The key components in our GLSAN include a global-local detection network (GLDN), a simple yet efficient self-adaptive region selecting algorithm (SARSA), and a local super-resolution network (LSRN). We integrate a global-local fusion strategy into a progressive scale-varying network to perform more precise detection, where the local fine detector can adaptively refine the target's bounding boxes detected by the global coarse detector via cropping the original images for higher-resolution detection. The SARSA can dynamically crop the crowded regions in the input images, which is unsupervised and can be easily plugged into the networks. Additionally, we train the LSRN to enlarge the cropped images, providing more detailed information for finer-scale feature extraction, helping the detector distinguish foreground and background more easily. The SARSA and LSRN also contribute to data augmentation towards network training, which makes the detector more robust. Extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations on the VisDrone2019-DET benchmark dataset and UAVDT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptivity of our method. Towards an industrial application, our network is also applied to a DroneBolts dataset with proven advantages. Our source codes have been available at https://github.com/dengsutao/glsan.",Drone,2021
A Simulation Framework for Developing Autonomous Drone Navigation Systems,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining popularity in an ever-increasing range of applications, mainly because they are able to navigate autonomously. In this work, we describe a simulation framework that can help engineering students who are starting out in the field of aerial robotics to acquire the necessary competences and skills for the development of autonomous drone navigation systems. In our framework, drone behavior is defined in a graphical way, by means of very intuitive state machines, whereas low-level control details have been abstracted. We show how the framework can be used to develop a navigation system proposal according to the rules of the ""ESII Drone Challenge"" student competition. We also show how the proposal can be evaluated in different test scenarios.",Drone,2021
Fast File Transfers from IoT Devices by Using Multiple Interfaces,"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a modern technological revolution that enables communication amongst a plethora of different devices. To date, about 30 billion devices have been connected to the internet and more than 75 billion devices are probably to be connected worldwide by 2025. These can range from small sensors and actuators to larger devices such as smartphones, drones or even buildings and interconnected cars. Devices are often mobile and battery powered thus their communication requires fast and energy efficient solutions. To this end, this paper studies the use of multi-interface communication for fast and energy efficient communication. In particular, we consider the basic operation of data transfer between smartphones in the form of files. This task can be performed for backup purposes, and hence it represents a useful and frequent operation that users perform. Our aim is to provide a new and easy means that optimises file transfers with respect to time and energy consumption. In particular, as smartphones are endowed with various connecting interfaces like Bluetooth, WiFi and 4G, we conduct experimental studies by varying different parameters in order to understand the best setting, including which interface is more appropriate to accomplish file transfer. To this respect, we also implemented an innovative and light app that allows the use of two or more interfaces concurrently. The experimental results show how the coupling of some interfaces might be effective in terms of time, while consuming a negligible amount of energy. Actually, such results become more and more interesting as the size of the file to be transferred grows. The best combination experienced is by making use of WiFi at 5 GHz concurrently with 4G, whereas WiFi at 2.4 GHz caused interference complications.",Drone,2021
Position Tracking Techniques Using Multiple Receivers for Anti-Drone Systems,"The need for drone traffic control management has emerged as the demand for drones increased. Particularly, in order to control unauthorized drones, the systems to detect and track drones have to be developed. In this paper, we propose the drone position tracking system using multiple Bluetooth low energy (BLE) receivers. The proposed system first estimates the target's location, which consists of the distance and angle, while using the received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals at four BLE receivers and gradually tracks the target based on the estimated distance and angle. We propose two tracking algorithms, depending on the estimation method and also apply the memory process, improving the tracking performance by using stored previous movement information. We evaluate the proposed system's performance in terms of the average number of movements that are required to track and the tracking success rate.",Drone,2021
Occlusion detection and drift-avoidance framework for 2D visual object tracking,"This paper presents a long-term 2D tracking framework for the coverage of live outdoor (e.g., sports) events that is suitable for embedded system application (e.g. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). This application scenario requires 2D target (e.g., athlete, ball, bicycle, boat) tracking for visually assisting the UAV pilot (or cameraman) to maintain proper target framing, or even for actual 3D target following/localization when the drone flies autonomously. In these cases, it should be expected that the target to be tracked/followed, may disappear from the UAV camera field of view, due to fast 3D target motion, illumination changes, or due to visual target occlusions by obstacles, even if the actual UAV continues following it (either autonomously, by exploiting alternative target localization sensors, or by pilot maneuvering). Therefore, the 2D tracker should be able to recover from such situations. The proposed framework solves exactly this problem. Target occlusions are detected from the 2D tracker responses. Depending on the occlusion immensity, the proposed framework decides whether to not update the tracking model, or to employ target re-detection in a broader window. As a result, the proposed framework allows continued target tracking once the target re-appears in the video stream, without tracker re-initialization.",Drone,2021
Feedback Linearization with Zero Dynamics Stabilization for Quadrotor Control,"A control solution for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle encapsulating a nonlinear inner-loop based on the application of feedback linearization to the attitude and altitude dynamics is proposed in this paper. Linear quadratic controllers with integrative action are implemented not only to the resulting inner-loop chain of integrators, but also to the outer-loop, that controls the horizontal movement and, consequently, stabilizes the zero-dynamics. The required full state-feedback relies on measurements from motion sensors and on-flight estimates provided by Kalman filters and a nonlinear attitude filter. In simulation, the capacity of trajectory tracking and withstanding significant deviations of the mass and inertia values of the proposed control structure are evaluated while considering saturation and noisy measurements. The simulations results were experimentally validated using a commercially available drone. The modeling and control system architecture are validated by the experimental results. Additionally, a comparison with the results achieved with a linear control solution developed in a previous work is drawn.",Drone,2021
An innovative bio-inspired flight controller for quad-rotor drones: Quad-rotor drone learning to fly using reinforcement learning,"Animals learn to master their capabilities by trial and error, and with out having any knowledge about their dynamics model and mathematical or physical rules. They use their maximum capabilities in an optimized way. This is the result of millions of years of evolution where the best of different possibilities are kept, and makes us rethink How does the nature perform things?, particularly when natural systems outperform our rigid systems. In this study, inspired by the nature, we developed an innovative algorithm by enhancing an existing reinforcement learning algorithm (proximal policy optimization (PPO)). Our algorithm is capable of learning to control a quad-rotor drone in order to fly. This new algorithm called Bio-inspired Flight Controller (BFC) does not use any conventional controller such as PID or MPC to control the quad-rotor drone. The goal of BFC is to completely replace the conventional controller with a controller that acts in a similar way to the animals where they learn to control their movements. It is capable of stabilizing a quad-copter in a desired point, and following way points. We implemented our algorithm in an AscTec Hummingbird quad-copter simulated in Gazebo, and tested it using different scenarios to fully measure its capabilities. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

CODA: Mobile interface for enabling safer navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles in real-world settings,"Recent legislation opening commercial operations to small drones, also known as Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) under 55 lbs, is leading to increased use across many facets of society including first responders, news agencies, commercial entities, and hobbyists. However, the widespread use of such systems will be limited unless a few key hurdles are overcome, namely improved usability and support for safe operation in dynamic environments. To this end, we present the Collision and Obstacle Detection and Alerting (CODA) display, a novel interface that enables safe piloting of MAVs with a mobile device in obstacle-dense real-world settings. We describe the system design, architecture, and development. In addition, we present observations from a proof-of-concept technical demonstration and an empirical study with minimally-trained users. Results showed that CODA reduced colli-sions and improved operator awareness of obstacle proximity, confidence going around corners and perceived performance in avoiding walls and obstacles.",Drone,2021
Temporal Siamese Networks for Clutter Mitigation Applied to Vision-Based Quadcopter Formation Control,"Convolutional neural networks applied to video streams often suffer from short-lived misclassifications or false alarms from clutter and noise. We introduce a novel network training method based on the Siamese Networks technique that mitigates false alarms in an Hourglass CNN that segments out quadcopters in a live video stream. To demonstrate this method in a real-world application in real-time, we implement it as part of a quadcopter tracker for vision-based formation control. Quadcopter drone formation control is an important capability for fields like area surveillance, search and rescue, agriculture, and reconnaissance. Of particular interest is formation control in environments where wireless communications and/or GPS may be either denied or not sufficiently accurate for the desired application. Using vision to guide the quadcopters addresses these situations, but computer vision algorithms are often computationally expensive and suffer from high false detection rates. Our novel Siamese networks-based clutter mitigation technique is a good way to mitigate this clutter without added computational complexity at run-time. We run our real-time implementation on an ODROID XU4 with a standard webcam mounted to a quadcopter drone. Flight tests in a motion capture volume demonstrate successful formation control with two quadcopters in a leader-follower setup.",Drone,2021
Remote Warfare and the Retooling of American Primacy,"This paper argues for the utility of remote warfare as a means of analysing the geopolitics of American primacy. Through the use of new technologies and surrogate forces to address security challenges with a minimal military footprint, remote warfare (re)imposes political distance between the United States and the sites of its military interventions. Its constitutive modalities of intervention range from drones and Special Operations Forces to Private Military Security Companies, security cooperation programmes and emerging technologies associated with Artificial Intelligence. As public support for large-scale overseas interventions has dwindled and strategic competition with China has intensified, remote warfare represents a means of 'retooling' US primacy, which is both a structural condition and a strategic orientation. As a strategic approach to the use of force, remote warfare enables the American state to project military power in a more flexible and sustainable manner. This has supported the maintenance of US primacy as Washington's strategic focus has shifted from counterterrorism towards a renewed emphasis on great power competition.",Drone,2020
Drones tracking based on robust Cubature Kalman-TBD-Multi-Bernoulli filter.,"The problem of nonlinear tracking and detection of small unmanned aerial vehicles and micro-drone targets is very challenging and has received great attention recently. Recently, the Cubature Kalman-multi-Bernoulli filter which employs a third-degree spherical-radical cubature rule has been presented to handle the nonlinear models. The Cubature Kalman filter is more principled and accurate in mathematical terms. In addition, a recent multi-Bernoulli filter based on variational Bayesian approximation has been presented with the estimation the fluctuation of variances of measurement. However, Cubature Kalman and variational Bayesian-Multi-Bernoulli filters are unsuitable for tracking the micro-drones because of the unknown probability of detection. As we known, the track-before-detect (TBD) schemes was an effective method for tracking the small objects. In this work, a novel robust Cubature Kalman-Multi-Bernoulli filter with variational Bayesian-TBD is proposed jointing with estimate the fluctuated variances of measurement. The improved filter is an effective method to solve the problem of detection profile estimation for micro-drones. A novel implementation with a non-linear Cubature Kalman Gaussian mixture and Inverse Gamma approximation is presented to estimate a hybrid kinematic state of micro-drones. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",Drone,2020
A revisit of the tonal noise of small rotors,"In this study, asymptotic analysis of the frequency-domain formulation to compute the tonal noise of the small rotors in the now ubiquitously multi-rotor powered drones is conducted. Simple scaling laws are proposed to evaluate the impacts of the influential parameters such as blade number, flow speed, rotation speed, unsteady motion, thrust and observer angle on the tonal noise. The rate of noise increment with thrust (or rotational speed) is determined by orders of blade passing frequency harmonics and the unsteady motion. The axial mean flow influence can be approximated by quadratic functions. At given thrust, the sound decreases rapidly with the radius and blade number as the surface pressure becomes less intensive. The higher tonal harmonics are significantly increased if unsteady motions, although of small-amplitude, are existed, as indicated by the defined sensitivity function, emphasizing that the unsteady motions should be avoided for quiet rotor designs. The scaling laws are examined by comparing with the full computations of the rotor noise using the frequency-domain method, the implementation of which has been validated by comparing with experiments. Good data collapse is obtained when the proposed scaling laws, which highlights the dominant influence of the design parameters, are incorporated.",Drone,2020
Sound quality factors influencing annoyance from hovering UAV,"This study investigates psychoacoustic aspects of the noise of multi-rotor type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Two psychoacoustic experiments were performed for a dual purpose: to examine the difference of annoyance induced by the noise from three types of UAVs and a civil aircraft and also to identify the acoustic factors influencing the annoyance from UAV noise. In the first experiment, the annoyance of each stimulus was quantified from psychoacoustic tests and compared with each other. The psychoacoustic tests confirms that UAV noise generally causes more annoyance than civil aircraft noise at the same loudness level. The physical and psychoacoustic indices of the stimuli were analyzed statistically using principal component analysis and regression. The loudness, sharpness and fluctuation strength were derived as significant factors that affect the annoyance of UAV noise. In the second experiment, six new sound samples were created by modifying the sharpness and the fluctuation strength of one representative UAV noise to check the results of the first experiment. Regressions of the test results reaffirmed that the sharpness and fluctuation strength are significant in the annoyance of UAV noise. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Drone,2020
Comparison of tropospheric parameters from Meteodrone measurements with GNSS estimates from ground-based stations,"This study presents a comparison of tropospheric parameters, namely zenith tropospheric delay and total refractivity calculated using meteorological measurements from a Meteodrone and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations. A Meteodrone is a unique Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) originally designed for automatic measurements of meteorological parameters in vertical profiles (up to 3 km above ground) for the assimilation into numerical weather prediction models. One profile measured with both ascending and descending drone takes approximately 20 min, and there are multiple flights possible during one night. The measurements for this campaign have been conducted in March 2019, in Marbach, Switzerland. We have collected pressure, temperature and humidity profiles from nine flights. From the measured meteorological parameters, we have calculated the refractivity and zenith tropospheric delays (ZTDs). The parameters are compared with models calculated from 32 neighboring GNSS stations interpolated using the in-house developed least-squares collocation software COMEDIE (COllocation of MEteorological Data for Interpretation and Estimation of tropospheric path delays). The comparisons between the Meteodrones and the GNSS-derived models show a good agreement with an average absolute bias of 2.4 mm with 1.5 mm standard deviation for ZTD and 2.7 ppm with 1.7 ppm standard deviation for the comparison of the refractivity. The bias is a result of local changes of meteorological conditions captured by the drone, but not by the interpolation model. (c) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Turbojet direct-thrust control scheme for full-envelope fuel consumption minimization,"Purpose - Reducing fuel consumption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during transient operation is a cornerstone to achieve environment-friendly operations. The purpose of this paper is to develop a control scheme that improves the fuel economy of a turbojet in its full operating envelope.Design/methodology/approach - A novel direct-thrust linear quadratic integral (LQI) approach, comprised by an optimal observer/controller satisfying specified performance parameters, is presented. The thrust estimator, based in a Wiener model, is validated with the experimental data of a micro-turbojet. Model uncertainty is characterized by analyzing variations between the identified model and measured data. The resulting uncertainty range is used to verify closed-loop stability with the circle criterion. The proposed controller provides stable responses with the specified performance in the whole operating range, even with after considering plant nonlinearities. Finally, the direct-thrust LQI is compared with a standard thrust controller to assess fuel economy and performance.Findings - The direct-thrust LQI approach reduced the fuel consumption by 2.1090% in the most realistic scenario. The controllers were also evaluated using the environmental effect parameter (EEP) and transient-thrust-specific fuel consumption (T-TSFC). These novel metrics are proposed to evaluate the environmental impact during transient-thrust operations. The direct-thrust LQI approach has a more efficient fuel consumption according to these metrics. The results also show that isolating the thrust dynamics within the feedback loop has an important impact in fuel economy. Controllers were also evaluated using the EEP and T-TSFC. These novel metrics are proposed to evaluate the environmental impact during transient-thrust operations. The direct-thrust LQI approach has a more efficient fuel consumption according to these metrics. The results also show that isolating the thrust dynamics within the feedback loop has an important impact in fuel economy.Originality/value - This study shows the design of an effective direct-thrust control approach that minimizes fuel consumption, ensures stable responses for the full operation range, allows isolating the thrust dynamics when designing the controller and is compatible with classical robustness and performance metrics. Finally, the study shows that a simple controller can reduce the fuel consumption of the turbojet during transient operation in scenarios that approximate realistic operatingconditions.",Drone,2020
Environmental chemical sensing using small drones: A review,"Recent advances in miniaturization of chemical instrumentation and in low-cost small drones are catalyzing exponential growth in the use of such platforms for environmental chemical sensing applications. The versatility of chemically sensitive drones is reflected by their rapid adoption in scientific, industrial, and regulatory domains, such as in atmospheric research studies, industrial emission monitoring, and in enforcement of environmental regulations. As a result of this interdisciplinarity, progress to date has been reported across a broad spread of scientific and non-scientific databases, including scientific journals, press releases, company websites, and field reports. The aim of this paper is to assemble all of these pieces of information into a comprehensive, structured and updated review of the field of chemical sensing using small drones. We exhaustively review current and emerging applications of this technology, as well as sensing platforms and algorithms developed by research groups and companies for tasks such as gas concentration mapping, source localization, and flux estimation.

Parallel Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention CNN-Based Motor Imagery Classification for BCI,"Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is an important part of the brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing people with mobility problems to communicate with the outside world via assistive devices. However, EEG decoding is a challenging task because of its complexity, dynamic nature, and low signal-to-noise ratio. Designing an end-to-end framework that fully extracts the high-level features of EEG signals remains a challenge. In this study, we present a parallel spatial-temporal self-attention-based convolutional neural network for four-class MI EEG signal classification. This study is the first to define a new spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG signals that uses the self-attention mechanism to extract distinguishable spatial-temporal features. Specifically, we use the spatial self-attention module to capture the spatial dependencies between the channels of MI EEG signals. This module updates each channel by aggregating features over all channels with a weighted summation, thus improving the classification accuracy and eliminating the artifacts caused by manual channel selection. Furthermore, the temporal self-attention module encodes the global temporal information into features for each sampling time step, so that the high-level temporal features of the MI EEG signals can be extracted in the time domain. Quantitative analysis shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for intra-subject and inter-subject classification, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. In terms of qualitative analysis, we perform a visual inspection of the new spatial-temporal representation estimated from the learned architecture. Finally, the proposed method is employed to realize control of drones based on EEG signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications.",Drone,2020
A performance-aware routing mechanism for flying ad hoc networks,"Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are visioned to unlock the potential of the Internet of Drones in various application scenarios like surveillance, agriculture, health care, disaster management, and rescue operations. As the unmanned aerial vehicles possess fast movements and frequent topological variations, selection of the next hop, self-adaptation, and avoidance of dissemination loops have proven to be the challenging issues that have a considerable impact on the performance of a FANET. We propose a performance-aware routing mechanism, G-OLSR, for efficient communication and collaboration among the unmanned aerial vehicles in a FANET environment. The self-adaptation of the network in case of any topological changes is considered in the proposed mechanism. Moreover, the proposed mechanism avoids the dissemination loops and it, consequently, improves the performance of the network. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism performs better in terms of delay, message overhead, packet delivery ratio, and throughput than Optimized Link State Routing.",Drone,2021
"A survey on cellular-connected UAVs: Design challenges, enabling 5G/B5G innovations, and experimental advancements","As an emerging field of aerial robotics, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant research interest within the wireless networking research community. As soon as national legislations allow UAVs to fly autonomously, we will see swarms of UAV populating the sky of our smart cities to accomplish different missions: parcel delivery, infrastructure monitoring, event filming, surveillance, tracking, etc. The UAV ecosystem can benefit from 5G/B5G cellular networks, which can be exploited in different ways to enhance UAV communications. Because of the inherent characteristics of UAV pertaining to flexible mobility in 3D space, autonomous operation and intelligent placement, these smart devices cater to wide range of wireless applications and use cases. This work aims at presenting an in-depth exploration of integration synergies between 5G/B5G cellular systems and UAV technology, where the UAV is integrated as a new aerial User Equipment (UE) to already deployed cellular networks. In this integration, the UAVs perform the role of flying users within cellular coverage, thus they are termed as cellular-connected UAVs. The main focus of this work is to present an extensive study of integration challenges along with key 5G/B5G technological innovations and ongoing efforts in design prototyping and field trials corroborating cellular-connected UAVs.

Applications of drones for safety inspection in the Gulf Cooperation Council construction,"Purpose construction industry in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member countries is at the peak as the region is in the stage of developing its infrastructures. Apart from some positive sign of this boost, several other issues have also been developed in the region. One of such issues is the safety of workers at the construction sites. This article, based on a variety of applications of drones in other industrial sectors, considers the use of drones for construction safety improvement in the GCC countries. This article aimed to investigate the safety-related applications of drones considering technical features and barriers and enablers for safety-related tasks. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods was adopted to achieve the aims and objectives of this research. Data were collected through a systematic literature review, semistructured interviews and using a structured questionnaire. A total of 37 relevant research items and 10 interviews were held with construction safety professionals, and 92 responses collected from the safety managers through a structured questionnaire was used to derive the conclusion of this research. The collected data were processed and analyzed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) program. Descriptive analyses were carried out in which means and importance factors were calculated. Findings 25.92% of participants confirmed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. The most common application of drones reported by the respondents was photography for marketing purposes followed by surveying application and quality inspections. The camera movability was the top-rated technical feature required for safety-related inspections. Similarly, ""Working near the corner or edge of unprotected opening"" was the top-rated application of drone for safety-related tasks. The safety concerns of using drones at job sites were rated as the most important barrier by the participants. Technical challenges associated with the use of drones for safety improvement was rated as the second most important barrier by the participants. Research limitations/implications Although, the research presented in this article is based on the GCC construction industry, however, since the data collected through systematic review and semistructured interviews are not a regional base, therefore the finding of this research could also be useful in other regions. Further research however, needs to be conducted to reduce the implications of the barriers identified in this paper so that the drone can be effectively used for safety improvement in construction not only in the GCC region but also in other countries. Practical implications Once the GCC construction industry will be able to overcome the challenges associated with the application of drones in safety improvement, the safety managers will be able to monitor the site more effectively which could be helpful to improve the safety performance of the construction organization. Social implications Improved safety performance in not only in the greater interest of the construction organizations as they can reduce the costs associated with poor safety but can also avoid the delay caused by construction accidents. Similarly, improved safety performance reduces the accidents at construction sites, and thus reduces injuries and disabilities caused by such accidents, making the construction workers a useful part of the society.The application of drones in safety-related tasks is one of the key solutions that can lead us to improved safety performance. Originality/value Although, the use of drone technology has revolutionized a number of industrial sectors due to its variety of applications, the application in construction particularly in the GCC region is still very limited. As noted in the results of this research, only 21 participants (25.92%) expressed that they or their company had used the drone in different activates. This means that the industry is not getting the full advantage of the available drone technology. The results of this research will enable construction industry stakeholders to know the challenges associated with the application of drones for safety improvement and to develop strategies to overcome these challenges.",Drone,2020
Mimicking nature's flyers: a review of insect-inspired flying robots,"Insects have attracted much interest from scientists and engineers as they offer an endless source of inspiration for creating innovative engineering designs. By mimicking flying insects, it may be possible to create highly efficient biomimetic drones. In this paper, we provide an overview on how the principles of insect flight, including large stroke amplitudes and wing rotations, the clap-and-fling effect and flight control have been implemented to successfully demonstrate untethered, controlled free-flight in the insect-inspired flying robots.

Experimentally Analyzing Diverse Antenna Placements and Orientations for UAV Communications,"A vast array of potential applications is emerging for drones and other devices to collaborate from disaster relief and search and rescue missions to smart agriculture and IoT systems. As drones move across multiple altitudes, they must have the ability to communicate across any direction in a three-dimensional (3D) space. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of the drone body and its interaction with the mounted antennas, different antenna positions on the drone can result in variations in the radiation pattern. While there have been a fair number of airborne communication works, few consider the role that antenna positioning has on the resulting transmission along the azimuth and elevation planes. In this work, we study the effects of the drone body and various antenna placements on the radiation pattern and fading of drone-based channels. Through systematic anechoic chamber and in-field measurements, we show that the drone body alters the radiation pattern of the mounted antennas, rendering the common assumption of a constant azimuth radiation pattern invalid. In addition, the body increases polarization mixing of drone-based channels, resulting in significant degradation of the cross-polarization discrimination (XPD). Hence, we propose using effective radiation pattern and XPD values instead of relying on measurements and/or assumptions that disregard drone-antenna interaction. We then analyze the shadowing and losses associated with the drone body for many antenna setups at various elevation angles and show that when mounted on the opposite side from the ground transmitter, shadowing increases with relatively-higher drone elevations. To account for these body-induced effects, we introduce rotational loss that results in better prediction results of the large-scale fading behavior compared to conventional models that neglect these body effects. Then, we analyze the small-scale fading for various antenna setups and show that the Rician K-factor is strongly dependent on elevation for polarization-matched vertical links, while it is approximately flat for cross-polarized links. To do so, we conduct a set of drone-to-drone (DtD) experiments at high altitudes with no surrounding reflectors and compare results to those obtained by our ground-to-drone (GtD) measurements. We find that, while at low elevations the ground can reduce the K-factor by 10 dB, at higher elevations, small-scale fading is dominated by the antennas, not the ground.",Drone,2020
Achieving Robust and Efficient Consensus for Large-Scale Drone Swarm,"Achieving consensus is a crucial problem for large scale drone swam to perform collaboration tasks. There are some critical issues for the consensus of large-scale drone swarms, such as limited-time convergence and high robustness against drone failure due to stringent requirements of mission cycle and hostile environment. Note that traditional consensus cannot guarantee limited-time convergence and a robust consensus against node failure. Existing finite-time consensus faces challenges of strict prerequisites and high complexity. Moreover, leaderless and leader-follower consensus adopts different models respectively. Toward these ends, a unified consensus model for both leaderless and leader-follower modes is proposed. It achieves limited-time convergence by using distributed energy minimization. A dynamic spanning tree algorithm is designed to ensure consensus under dynamic topology. Furthermore, a robust method against node failure is proposed by combining grey prediction, average consensus, and Molly-Reed criterion. Simulation results show that the proposed methods can be adopted in both leaderless and leader-follower situations with advantages of limited-time convergence and high robustness.",Drone,2020
An FSO-Based Drone Charging System for Emergency Communications,"In a disaster struck area (DSA), macro base stations (MBSs) are usually damaged, and thus the wireless network becomes dysfunctional. To efficiently recover the communications, drone mounted base stations (DBSs) are deployed to relay data between the mobile users (MUs) in a DSA and working MBSs in the proximity of the DSA. However, a DBS may be deployed far away from a working MBS, thus limiting the backhaul link capacity between the DBS and the MBS. Also, the hovering time of current drones is limited, and thus caps the usage of DBSs. In order to increase the backhaul link capacity and prolong the hovering time of a DBS, we propose to apply free space optics to enable an MBS to simultaneously transmit data streams and energy to a DBS with high efficiency. The problem of jointly optimizing the DBS placement as well as the access link bandwidth allocation is formulated to maximize the hovering time of a DBS and guarantee the data rate requirements of the MUs. The joint bandwidth allocation DBS placement (TWIST) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The performance of TWIST is demonstrated through simulations.",Drone,2020
A Novel Drone's Height Control Algorithm for Throughput Optimization in Disaster Resilient Network,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles) networks using unmanned aerial vehicles called UAVs have been studied as one of the means for constructing temporary wireless communication networks in the event of a disaster. In this paper, we investigate a drone network using a rotor UAV called a drone that can be hovered and easy to construct a network. On the other hand, it is expected that the distribution of communication terminals on the ground will be uneven because people concentrate in specific places such as evacuation centers in the actual disaster area. Traffic concentrates on specific drones covering the area where terrestrial terminals are dense, then throughput per terminal decreases. In order to solve this problem, we propose a method to control the height of drone according to the traffic and to select the transmission method by link adaptation, well-known in wireless LAN and cellular systems. By computer simulation, the average throughputs per ground terminal for the heights of the drones are shown quantitatively, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is clarified.",Drone,2020
Designing efficient communication infrastructure in post-disaster situations with limited availability of network resources,"In the aftermath of a large-scale disaster, such as an earthquake, existing telecommunication (e.g., cellular towers) and other public infrastructures (e.g., power lines, roads, etc.) are often severely damaged. This prevents the seamless exchange of situational awareness and rescue/relief based information between the volunteers, shelter points, and the coordination center. A temporary communication infrastructure utilizing smartphones, communication towers, drones, smart badges, etc., commonly referred to as network resources, can be formed, which promises to bridge the communication gap between various stakeholders in the disaster area and enable timely information exchange between them. However, the efficacy of such networks is often challenged by the limited availability of network resources in the disaster area. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose to design, develop, and test a novel strategy that intelligently deploys the limited network resources in the disaster area, and thus, creates an efficient temporary communication infrastructure in such resource-constrained post-disaster situations. We formulate the network resource deployment (ResDep) problem as an integer linear programming optimization problem and show that it is NP-Hard. Next, we propose a near-optimal polynomial-time heuristic solution for solving it. Our extensive simulation study on top of ONE simulator and proof-of-concept pilot deployment study, both based on our university, National Institute of Technology - Durgapur, India, reveal that the proposed heuristic performs nearly as well as that of the optimal solution (computed using Gurobi optimizer), and outperforms its variant and baseline approaches when compared in terms of end-to-end network latency and message delivery.",Drone,2020
"Fast Beamforming for Dynamic, Randomly Configured Antenna Arrays and Metamaterials","We propose methods to determine beam-forming excitation phase profiles for arbitrarily oriented arrays of antennas and scatterers, made of arbitrarily polarized elements. Our generalized analytical phasing (GAP) method provides rapid near-optimal phasing, enabling real-time beam steering with high-element-count, and dynamically configured arrays. In addition, we propose a reduced-order numerical phasing (RONP) method that converts an N-dimensional unknown parameter space (the N unknown phases) to a 2-D space (the optimal beam polarization). Though not as fast as the GAP, this method introduces no reduction in phasing accuracy. Both methods are suitable for a wide range of antenna array and metasurface designs.",Drone,2020
SecAuthUAV: A Novel Authentication Scheme for UAV-Ground Station and UAV-UAV Communication,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming very popular nowadays due to the emergence of application areas such as the Internet of Drones (IoD). They are finding wide applicability in areas ranging from package delivery systems to automated military applications. Nevertheless, communication security between a UAV and its ground station (GS) is critical for completing its task without leaking sensitive information either to the adversaries or to unauthenticated users. UAVs are especially vulnerable to physical capture and node tampering attacks. Further, since UAV devices are generally equipped with small batteries and limited memory storage, lightweight security techniques are best suited for them. Addressing these issues, a lightweight mutual authentication scheme based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for UAV-GS authentication is presented in this paper. The UAV-GS authentication scheme is extended further to support UAV-UAV authentication. We present a formal security analysis as well as old-fashioned cryptanalysis and show that our protocol provides various security features such as mutual authentication, user anonymity, etc, and is resilient against many security attacks such as masquerade, replay, node tampering, and cloning attacks, etc. We also compare the performance of our protocol with state-of-the-art authentication protocols for UAVs, based on computation, communication, and memory storage cost.",Drone,2020
Digitising the Virtual: Movement and Relations in Drone Warfare,"This article offers a relational analysis of the use of armed drones in the 'war on terror'. Drawing from Erin Manning's writings on movement, relations, and the posthuman, I explore how bodies and spaces are read as digitised data in the processes of the drone assemblage, reducing movement to displacement and undoing relations of becoming. The drone's violence lies in its crippling of bodies' capacity to respond to their immediate environments and relations. The point of departure for this article is the concept of the 'virtual' as drawn out by Manning: the indeterminate potential of movement which moves bodies and relations. My analysis revisits the transcripts of Uruzgan drone attack in Afghanistan in 2010, a case that has been extensively studied in the critical literature on drones to offer conceptions of what it means for the drone to be a posthuman entity. Instead of situating the drone as a posthuman object, I examine it from a posthuman methodology where the focus is on relations, rather than determinate actors or outcomes. My intervention here is twofold: to propose a framework for understanding the drone's violence in its processes of disrupting and undoing relations, and relatedly to argue for the methodological and theoretical value of the posthuman.Numeriser le virtuel: Mouvement et relations dans la guerre des drones",Drone,2020
Performance Evaluation of UAV-Enabled Cellular Networks With Battery-Limited Drones,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as flying base stations (BSs) to offload Macro-BSs in hotspots. However, due to the limited battery on-board, UAVs can typically stay in operation for less than 1.5 hours. Afterward, the UAV has to fly back to a dedicated charging station that recharges/replaces the UAV's battery. In this letter, we study the performance of a UAV-enabled cellular network while capturing the influence of the spatial distribution of the charging stations. In particular, we use tools from stochastic geometry to derive the coverage probability of a UAV-enabled cellular network as a function of the battery size, the density of the charging stations, and the time required for recharging/replacing the battery.",Drone,2020
A Drone Fitted With a Magnetometer Detects Landmines,"Many antipersonnel (AP) and antitank (AT) mines remain in the ground across South Korea; some are partially exposed and remain visible. We used a drone fit with a magnetometer to detect landmines. The magnetic characteristics of landmines were measured, and altitude and flight conditions (altitude < 1 m) required for successful landmine detection were derived. Metallic AP and AT mines, and low metal content AT mines were detected in field tests under the proposed conditions. The drone can be used to aid in the demining of South Korea.",Drone,2020
Ultra-Wideband Air-to-Ground Propagation Channel Characterization in an Open Area,"This article studies the air-to-ground ultra-wideband channel through propagation measurements between 3.1 to 4.8 GHz using unmanned-aerial-vehicles (UAVs). Different line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed-LOS scenarios and two antenna orientations were used in the experiments. Multipath channel statistics for different propagation scenarios were obtained, and the Saleh-Valenzuela model was found to provide a good fit for the statistical channel model. An analytical path loss model based on antenna gains in the elevation plane is provided for unobstructed UAV hovering and moving (in a circular path) propagation scenarios.",Drone,2020
Hover or Perch: Comparing Capacity of Airborne and Landed Millimeter-Wave UAV Cells,"On-demand deployments of millimeter-wave (mmWave) access points (APs) carried by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered today as a potential solution to enhance the performance of 5G+ networks. The battery lifetime of modern UAVs, though, limits the flight times in such systems. In this letter, we evaluate a feasible deployment alternative for temporary capacity boosting in the areas with highly fluctuating user demands. The approach is to land UAV-based mmWave APs on the nearby buildings instead of hovering over the area. Within the developed mathematical framework, we compare the system-level performance of airborne and landed deployments by taking into account the full operation cycle of the employed drones. Our numerical results demonstrate that the choice of the UAV deployment option is determined by an interplay of the separation distance between the service area and the UAV charging station, drone battery lifetime, and the number of aerial APs in use. The presented methodology and results can support efficient on-demand deployments of UAV-based mmWave APs in prospective 5G+ networks.",Drone,2020
A Directional Gamma-Ray Spectrometer With Microcontroller-Embedded Machine Learning,"The enhancement of a compact gamma-ray detection module for spectroscopy and imaging with machine learning for directional sensitivity is presented. In particular this development is targeted towards drone-based localization of radioactive sources in the environment. The unit is composed of a cylindrical monolithic scintillator crystal (3 '' x 3 '' LaBr3(Ce3++Sr2+)), read by an array of 144 solid-state SiPM detectors whose signals are conditioned by an integrated front-end. In addition to state-of-the-art energy resolution (2.6% at 662keV) and sub-centimeter spatial resolution in the reconstruction of the photon interaction point projected on the base, this portable unit enables the 2D angular localization of gamma sources on a plane parallel to the detectors array as a function of the reconstructed interaction point distribution, thanks to a decision tree. The classifier is compared with other techniques (k-NN, PCA) and optimized with 1000 splits. It runs in a 32-bit ARM micro-controller for real-time operation with a processing time of 2.75 mu s per event, compatible with high gamma-ray counting rate (100kcps) operation. Despite the absence of a collimator, classification is correct within +/- 30 degrees for a single photon. Angular resolution of 0.5 degrees and accuracy better than 2 degrees are experimentally demonstrated (along with 0.8W power consumption and 3kg weight), showing potential for identification of sources in the field.",Drone,2020
Real-Time Object Processing and Routing for Intelligent Drones: A Novel Approach,We propose a real-time object-processing and smart-routing system using an unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted camera and an object-recognition algorithm to determine the image coordinates of object locations to calculate the shortest route between coordinates.

Aerial Base Station Deployment in 6G Cellular Networks Using Tethered Drones: The Mobility and Endurance Tradeoff,"Airborne base stations (BSs) (carried by drones) have a great potential to enhance the coverage and capacity of 6G cellular networks. However, one of the main challenges facing the deployment of airborne BSs is the limited available energy at the drone, which curtails the flight time. In fact, most current unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can only operate for a maximum of 1 h. The need to frequently visit the ground station (GS) to recharge limits the performance of the UAV-enabled cellular network and leaves the UAV?s coverage area temporarily out of service. In this article, we propose a UAV-enabled cellular network setup based on tethered UAVs (tUAVs). In the proposed setup, the tUAV is connected to a GS through a tether, which provides the tUAV with both energy and data. This enables a flight that can last for days. We describe in detail the components of the proposed system. Furthermore, we list the main advantages of a tUAV-enabled cellular network compared to typical untethered UAVs (uUAVs). Next, we discuss the potential applications and use cases for tUAVs. We also provide Monte Carlo simulations to compare the performance of tUAVs and uUAVs in terms of coverage probability. For instance, for a uUAV that is available 70% of the time (while unavailable because of charging or changing the battery 30% of the time), the simulation results show that tUAVs with a 120-m tether length can provide up to a 30% increase in coverage probability compared to uUAVs. Finally, we discuss the challenges, design considerations, and future research directions to realize the proposed setup.",Drone,2020
Sky Monitoring System for Flying Object Detection Using 4K Resolution Camera,"The use of drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles has expanded rapidly in recent years. These devices are expected to enter practical use in various fields, such as taking measurements through aerial photography and transporting small and lightweight objects. Simultaneously, concerns over these devices being misused for terrorism or other criminal activities have increased. In response, several sensor systems have been developed to monitor drone flights. In particular, with the recent progress of deep neural network technology, the monitoring of systems using image processing has been proposed. This study developed a monitoring system for flying objects using a 4K camera and a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model to achieve real-time processing. We installed a monitoring system in a high-rise building in an urban area during this study and evaluated the precision with which it could detect flying objects at different distances under different weather conditions. The results obtained provide important information for determining the accuracy of monitoring systems with image processing in practice.",Drone,2020
Scan Pattern Characterization of Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar Sensor for UAS Laser Scanning,"Many lightweight lidar sensors employed for UAS lidar mapping feature a fan-style laser emitter-detector configuration which results in a non-uniform pattern of laser pulse returns. As the role of UAS lidar mapping grows in both research and industry, it is imperative to understand the behavior of the fan-style lidar sensor to ensure proper mission planning. This study introduces sensor modeling software for scanning simulation and analytical equations developed in-house to characterize the non-uniform return density (i.e., scan pattern) of the fan-style sensor, with special focus given to a popular fan-style sensor, the Velodyne VLP-16 laser scanner. The results indicate that, despite the high pulse frequency of modern scanners, areas of poor laser pulse coverage are often present along the scanning path under typical mission parameters. These areas of poor coverage appear in a variety of shapes and sizes which do not necessarily correspond to the forward speed of the scanner or the height of the scanner above the ground, highlighting the importance of scan simulation for proper mission planning when using a fan-style sensor.",Drone,2020
A Review on Auditory Perception for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Although a significant amount of work has been carried out for visual perception in the context of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), not so much has been done regarding auditory perception. The latter can complement the observation of the environment that surrounds a UAV by providing additional information that can be used to detect, classify, and localize audio sources of interest. Motivated by the usefulness of auditory perception for UAVs, we present a literature review that discusses the audio techniques and microphone configurations reported in the literature. A categorization of techniques is proposed based on the role a UAV plays in the auditory perception (is it the one being perceived or is it the perceiver?), as well as a set of objectives that are more popularly aimed to be accomplished in the current literature (detection, classification, and localization). This literature review aims to provide a concise landscape of the most relevant works on auditory perception in the context of UAVs to date and provides insights into future avenues of research as a guide to those who are beginning to work in this field.",Drone,2020
Gathering Big Data in Wireless Sensor Networks by Drone (dagger),"The benefits of using mobile sinks or data mules for data collection in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) have been studied in several works. However, most of them consider only the WSN limitations and sensor nodes having no more than one data packet to transmit. This paper considers each sensor node having a relatively larger volume of data stored in its memory. That is, they have several data packets to send to sink. We also consider a drone with hovering capability, such as a quad-copter, as a mobile sink to gather this data. Hence, the mobile collector eventually has to hover to guarantee that all data will be received. Drones, however, have a limited power supply that restricts their flying time. Hence, the drone's energy cost must also be considered to increase the amount of collected data from the WSN. This work investigates the problem of determining the best drone tour for big data gathering in a WSN. We focus on minimizing the overall drone flight time needed to collect all data from the WSN. We propose an algorithm to create a subset of sensor nodes to send data to the drone during its movement and, consequently, reduce its hovering time. The proposed algorithm guarantees that the drone will stay a minimum time inside every sensor node's radio range. Our experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm surpasses, by up to 30%, the state-of-the-art heuristics' performance in finding drone tours in this type of scenario.",Drone,2020
Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Automate Aircraft Maintenance Visual Inspection,"Convolutional Neural Networks combined with autonomous drones are increasingly seen as enablers of partially automating the aircraft maintenance visual inspection process. Such an innovative concept can have a significant impact on aircraft operations. Though supporting aircraft maintenance engineers detect and classify a wide range of defects, the time spent on inspection can significantly be reduced. Examples of defects that can be automatically detected include aircraft dents, paint defects, cracks and holes, and lightning strike damage. Additionally, this concept could also increase the accuracy of damage detection and reduce the number of aircraft inspection incidents related to human factors like fatigue and time pressure. In our previous work, we have applied a recent Convolutional Neural Network architecture known by MASK R-CNN to detect aircraft dents. MASK-RCNN was chosen because it enables the detection of multiple objects in an image while simultaneously generating a segmentation mask for each instance. The previously obtained F-1 and F-2 scores were 62.67% and 59.35%, respectively. This paper extends the previous work by applying different techniques to improve and evaluate prediction performance experimentally. The approach uses include (1) Balancing the original dataset by adding images without dents; (2) Increasing data homogeneity by focusing on wing images only; (3) Exploring the potential of three augmentation techniques in improving model performance namely flipping, rotating, and blurring; and (4) using a pre-classifier in combination with MASK R-CNN. The results show that a hybrid approach combining MASK R-CNN and augmentation techniques leads to an improved performance with an F-1 score of (67.50%) and F-2 score of (66.37%).",Drone,2020
Flying object detection system using an omnidirectional camera,"While the effective utilization of drones is expected to grow in a wide range of fields, there are concerns over new threats related to the exploitation of drones that have not been considered thus far. From the perspective of surveillance, the remarkable ability of drones to fly in any arbitrary direction imposes the need for wider range sensing than ever. Cameras are commonly used as surveillance devices; however, traditional cameras capture a limited field of view and, although the output can have a spatially dense resolution, there are significant blind spots. Omnidirectional cameras are emerging as devices that can capture almost all directions simultaneously with one device. In this paper, we present a drone detection system that uses an omnidirectional camera. We use system modularization to improve the detection accuracy for small objects through a combination of image dividing and state-of-the-art object detection algorithms. Three-dimensional direction of detected objects is visualized by our system using the well-calibrated intrinsic/extrinsic parameters of the omnidirectional camera. Our system was evaluated using a dataset for actual flying drones recorded using an omnidirectional camera. Our quantitative evaluation indicates that our system achieved an at-best average precision and average recall of over 0.8 for small objects represented as 10-20 pixel squares in the original image.

Using Deep Learning for Visual Navigation of Drone with Respect to 3D Ground Objects,"In the paper, visual navigation of a drone is considered. The drone navigation problem consists of two parts. The first part is finding the real position and orientation of the drone. The second part is finding the difference between desirable and real position and orientation of the drone and creation of the correspondent control signal for decreasing the difference. For the first part of the drone navigation problem, the paper presents a method for determining the coordinates of the drone camera with respect to known three-dimensional (3D) ground objects using deep learning. The algorithm has two stages. It causes the algorithm to be easy for interpretation by artificial neural network (ANN) and consequently increases its accuracy. At the first stage, we use the first ANN to find coordinates of the object origin projection. At the second stage, we use the second ANN to find the drone camera position and orientation. The algorithm has high accuracy (these errors were found for the validation set of images as differences between positions and orientations, obtained from a pretrained artificial neural network, and known positions and orientations), it is not sensitive to interference associated with changes in lighting, the appearance of external moving objects and the other phenomena where other methods of visual navigation are not effective. For the second part of the drone navigation problem, the paper presents a method for stabilization of drone flight controlled by autopilot with time delay. Indeed, image processing for navigation demands a lot of time and results in a time delay. However, the proposed method allows to get stable control in the presence of this time delay.",Drone,2020
Using Diffusion Map for Visual Navigation of a Ground Robot,"This paper presents the visual navigation method for determining the position and orientation of a ground robot using a diffusion map of robot images (obtained from a camera in an upper position-e.g., tower, drone) and for investigating robot stability with respect to desirable paths and control with time delay. The time delay appears because of image processing for visual navigation. We consider a diffusion map as a possible alternative to the currently popular deep learning, comparing the possibilities of these two methods for visual navigation of ground robots. The diffusion map projects an image (described by a point in multidimensional space) to a low-dimensional manifold preserving the mutual relationships between the data. We find the ground robot's position and orientation as a function of coordinates of the robot image on the low-dimensional manifold obtained from the diffusion map. We compare these coordinates with coordinates obtained from deep learning. The algorithm has higher accuracy and is not sensitive to changes in lighting, the appearance of external moving objects, and other phenomena. However, the diffusion map needs a larger calculation time than deep learning. We consider possible future steps for reducing this calculation time.",Drone,2020
Object Detection in Aerial Navigation using Wavelet Transform and Convolutional Neural Networks: A First Approach,"This paper proposes a first approach based on wavelet analysis inside image processing for object detection with a repetitive pattern and binary classification in the image plane, in particular for navigation in simulated environments. To date, it has become common to use algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process images obtained from the on-board camera of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the spatial domain, being useful in detection and classification tasks. CNN architecture can receive images without pre-processing, as input in the training stage. This advantage allows us to extract the characteristic features of the image. Nevertheless, in this work, we argue that characteristics at different frequencies, low and high, also affect the performance of CNN during training. Thus, we propose a CNN architecture complemented by the 2D discrete wavelet transform, which is a feature extraction method. Wavelet analysis allows us to use time-frequency information through a multiresolution analysis. Therefore, we have investigated the combination of multiresolution analysis, via wavelets, in conjunction with CNN architectures, to use the information in the wavelet domain as input to the training stage. The information improves the learning capacity, eliminates the overfitting, and achieves a better efficiency in the detection of a target. Also, our learning model was evaluated in the aerial navigation of a drone.",Drone,2020
"Self-damping of the relaxation oscillations in miniature pulsed transmitter for sub-nanosecond-precision, long-distance LIDAR","Peak power is a critical factor for sub-nanosecond-pulsed transmitters utilizing laser diodes (LD) and applied to long distance LIDARs (light detection and ranging) for drones and automotive applications. Receiver speed is not anymore a limiting factor thanks to replacing linear (typically avalanche) detectors and a broad-band amplifier with a single photon avalanche detector (SPAD). Consequently the transmitters become the bottle neck in the resolution and ranging. The simplest and lowest-possible-cost transmitter consists of a switch, an LD, a storage capacitor C, and unavoidable parasitic loop inductance L. In the resulting resonant circuit, the principal problem consists of suppressing relaxation oscillations. Traditional way of oscillation damping reduce peak current and increase the pulse width. Here we show that specific transient properties of a Si avalanche switch solves the problem automatically provided the inductance is sufficiently low. This finding advances the state-of-the-art by reaching 90 W/1ns/200 kHz pulses from a miniature low-cost transmitter based on Si avalanching bipolar junction transistor (ABJT). Besides, the same self-damping effect may be realized in other switches maintaining significant residual voltage despite of fast current reduction.",Drone,2020
IoD swarms collision avoidance via improved particle swarm optimization,"Drones flights have been investigated widely. In the presence of high density and complex missions, collision avoidance among swarm of drones and with environment obstacles becomes a challenging task and indispensable. This paper aims to enhance the optimality and rapidity of three dimensional IoD path generation by improving the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The improvements include using chaos map logic to initialize the population of PSO. Also, adaptive mutation is utilized to balance local and global search. Then, the inactive particles are replaced by new fresh particles to push the solution toward global optimal. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulation is carried out and the results are compared with slandered PSO and with recent work CIPSO. The results exhibit significant improvement in convergence speed as well as optimal solution which prove the ability of proposed method to generate safety path for IoD formation without collision with terrain obstacle and among drones.",Drone,2020
Threat modeling of a multi-UAV system,"As Multi-UAV systems are still in early design stages, threat modeling can play a crucial role in attaining the ""secure by design"" notion in such complex cyber-physical systems (CPS).

The proposed threat tree is meant to provide a holistic perspective of threats impacting an IoD system.",Drone,2020
Deep learning-based object detection in low-altitude UAV datasets: A survey,"Deep learning-based object detection solutions emerged from computer vision has captivated full attention in recent years. The growing UAV market trends and interest in potential applications such as surveillance, visual navigation, object detection, and sensors-based obstacle avoidance planning have been holding good promises in the area of deep learning. Object detection algorithms implemented in deep learning framework have rapidly became a method for processing of moving images captured from drones. The primary objective of the paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art deep learning based object detection algorithms and analyze recent contributions of these algorithms to low altitude UAV datasets. The core focus of the studies is low-altitude UAV datasets because relatively less contribution was seen in the literature when compared with standard or remote-sensing based datasets. The paper discusses the following algorithms: Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN, R-FCN etc. into two-stage, YOLO and its variants, SSD, RetinaNet into one-stage and CornerNet, Objects as Point etc. under advanced stages in deep learning based detectors. Further, one-two and advanced stages of detectors are studied in detail focusing on low-altitude UAV datasets. The paper provides a broad summary of low altitude datasets along with their respective literature in detection algorithms for the potential use of researchers.

First Results From Drone-Based Transient Electromagnetic Survey to Map and Detect Unexploded Ordnance,"Unexploded ordnance (UXO), which causes many civilian casualties every year, has become a serious environmental problem. To deal with the problem, we have developed a new drone-based transient electromagnetic (TEM) system, which was designed for the UXO detection through very low altitude measurements. Drone-based TEM system uses the rotorcraft equipped with central loop TEM device to realize the UXO detection. The system was more safe and efficient than a ground-based TEM system in UXO detection. Compared with the airborne magnetic method or helicopter-borne TEM system, it has the advantages of low cost, flight safety, and so on. In this letter, the system characteristics are introduced in detail, providing the theoretical analysis of the system in UXO detection and verification of model data.

A fuzzy-based framework to support multicriteria design of mechatronic systems,"Designing a mechatronic system is a complex task since it deals with a high number of system components with multidisciplinary nature in the presence of interacting design objectives. Currently, the sequential design is widely used by designers in industries that deal with different domains and their corresponding design objectives separately leading to a functional but not necessarily an optimal result. Consequently, the need for a systematic and multiobjective design methodology arises. A new conceptual design approach based on a multicriteria profile for mechatronic systems has been previously presented by the authors, which uses a series of nonlinear fuzzy-based aggregation functions to facilitate decision-making for design evaluation in the presence of interacting criteria. Choquet fuzzy integrals are one of the most expressive and reliable preference models used in decision theory for multicriteria decision-making. They perform a weighted aggregation by the means of fuzzy measures assigning a weight to any coalition of criteria. This enables the designers to model importance and also interactions among criteria, thus covering an important range of possible decision outcomes. However, specification of the fuzzy measures involves many parameters and is very difficult when only relying on the designer's intuition. In this paper, we discuss three different methods of fuzzy measure identification tailored for mechatronic design process and exemplified by a case study of designing a vision-guided quadrotor drone. The results obtained from each method are discussed in the end.",Drone,2020
"Continuous Monitoring of TATP Using Ultrasensitive, Low-Power Sensors","There is a growing need for a continuous monitoring system that can detect explosives such as triacetone triperoxide (TATP) in the vapor phase at trace levels. TATP is an energetic material commonly used by terrorists in improvised explosive devices both as the initiator and the energetic material itself. TATP is still going largely undetected in many densely populated venues such as train stations and airports. No electronic trace detection system currently exists that is capable of continuously monitoring TATP, or its precursors, in the vapor phase. Recently, we developed a thermodynamic sensor that can detect TATP and other nitrogen-based explosives in the vapor phase at the ppb level. These ultrathin sensors showed unparalleled sensitivity and could even be operated at low enough powers to enable them to be deployed on drones. The sensor relies on specific oxidation-reduction reactions between the energetic molecules and metal oxide catalysts. Here, catalyst coated microheaters measure the heat effects associated with redox reactions occurring on the surface of the metal oxide catalyst. Enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were achieved through implementation of ultrathin (8 mu m thick) yttria-stabilized-zirconia (YSZ) as the substrate for the sensor platform. This reduction in the thermal mass combined with the catalytic amplification associated with Pd microheaters and optimized catalyst porosity enabled us to detect TATP in the vapor phase at unprecedented levels.",Drone,2020
EUD-MARS: End-user development of model-driven adaptive robotics software systems,"Empowering end-users to program robots is becoming more significant. Introducing software engineering principles into end-user programming could improve the quality of the developed software applications. For example, model-driven development improves technology independence and adaptive systems act upon changes in their context of use. However, end-users need to apply such principles in a non-daunting manner and without incurring a steep learning curve. This paper presents EUD-MARS that aims to provide end-users with a simple approach for developing model-driven adaptive robotics software. End-users include people like hobbyists and students who are not professional programmers but are interested in programming robots. EUD-MARS supports robots like hobby drones and educational humanoids that are available for end-users. It offers a tool for software developers and another one for end-users. We evaluated EUD-MARS from three perspectives. First, we used EUD-MARS to program different types of robots and assessed its visual programming language against existing design principles. Second, we asked software developers to use EUD-MARS to configure robots and obtained their feedback on strengths and points for improvement. Third, we observed how end-users explain and develop EUD-MARS programs, and obtained their feedback mainly on understandability, ease of programming, and desirability. These evaluations yielded positive indications of EUD-MARS. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Fusion Kalman and Weighted UFIR State Estimator With Improved Accuracy,"In this article, estimates of the Kalman filter (KF) and weighted unbiased finite impulse response (UFIR) filter are fused in discrete time-varying state-space to improve the robustness in uncertain environments associated with industrial applications. The weighted UFIR filter is derived using the Frobenius norm and termed as Frobenius finite impulse response (FFIR) filter. It is confirmed that the FFIR filter has better performance under the uncertainties and errors in the noise statistics, while the KF filter is best when the model and noise are exactly known. Based on a numerical example of a hover system, we show that the FFIR filter is able to outperform the UFIR filter and that the fusion KF/FFIR filter is able to outperform both of them. An experimental verification provided for the drone velocity estimation under the hover operation conditions has proved a better accuracy and robustness of the proposed fusion KF/FFIR filter.",Drone,2020
Who's prone to drone? A global time-series analysis of armed uninhabited aerial vehicle proliferation,"What determines whether countries pursue and obtain armed drones? Using an original time-series dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of armed drone proliferation from 1994 to 2019. We theorize and find evidence that security threats-like terrorism-are not the only factors driving proliferation. Regime type also has a significant effect, but it varies over time. From 1994 to 2010 regime type had no significant effect. However, non-democracies became significantly more likely to pursue and obtain armed drones from 2011 to 2019 owing to China's entrance into the drone export market, which asymmetrically eased supply-side constraints for non-democracies. We also find that status-seeking states are more likely to pursue armed drones. Our results contribute to the broader academic literature on proliferation by demonstrating how supply shocks can lead to changes in proliferation trends over time and lending further credence to the importance of prestige in international politics.",Drone,2020
Weight optimization of hydrogen storage vessels for quadcopter UAV using genetic algorithm,"Multicopter is relatively easy to control and is used in various fields. Typical multicopter drones use batteries as a power source, but it has limitations in flight time. The aim of this study is to contribute to the increase of flight time through the use of hydrogen fuel cells and weight reduction of drones. In this study, the weight of hydrogen storage vessel is optimized using a genetic algorithm and a numerical analysis based on the Tsai-Wu failure theory. As a result, the vessel weight was reduced by more than 23.79% compared to the initial weight in the algorithm iteration. To confirm that the weight optimization and using hydrogen fuel cell improved flight time, the hovering times are calculated. Consequently, the hovering time when using the hydrogen fuel cell is increased by 37.85% than using the batteries. And the hovering time increased by 17.73% with optimized vessel weight.

Extension of a PID control theory to Lie groups applied to synchronising satellites and drones,"The authors tackle time synchronisation of two (possibly non-identical) second-order dynamical systems whose state space possess the structure of a Lie group. Synchronisation is treated as a non-linear control problem on Lie groups. They present a control theory inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) regulation principle. The resulting L-PID control scheme is applied to sync the rotational component of motions in physical systems. A model-dependent version of the L-PID, equipped with a dynamics-cancelling component, is theoretically proven to converge to zero control error by a Lyapunov stability analysis. Furthermore, they present Lie-group-tailored numerical techniques to implement the devised PID regulation theory and test such numerical schemes on two dynamical systems, namely, a gyrostat satellite and a quadrotor drone. As a further extension, they present an empirical translational synchronisation algorithm for two drones based on a pair of concurring L-PID and projected-PID controllers.",Drone,2020
Search and rescue with airborne optical sectioning,"Autonomous drones can help find injured or missing people when a large or hard to traverse area has to be searched, but their view can be obscured in dense forests. David Schedl and colleagues have developed a method to reveal humans in thermal imaging recordings, even in the presence of dense foliage.In the future, rescuing lost, ill or injured persons will increasingly be carried out by autonomous drones. However, discovering humans in densely forested terrain is challenging because of occlusion, and robust detection mechanisms are required. We show that automated person detection under occlusion conditions can be notably improved by combining multi-perspective images before classification. Here, we employ image integration by airborne optical sectioning (AOS)-a synthetic aperture imaging technique that uses camera drones to capture unstructured thermal light fields-to achieve this with a precision and recall of 96% and 93%, respectively. Finding lost or injured people in dense forests is not generally feasible with thermal recordings, but becomes practical with the use of AOS integral images. Our findings lay the foundation for effective future search-and-rescue technologies that can be applied in combination with autonomous or manned aircraft. They can also be beneficial for other fields that currently suffer from inaccurate classification of partially occluded people, animals or objects.",Drone,2020
Assembling Israeli drone warfare: Loitering surveillance and operational sustainability,"This article examines how unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones as they are more popularly known, have changed practices of Israeli warfare. In order to do so, the article proceeds in three steps. First, it traces the emergence and development of the Israeli UAV programme. Second, it examines the main factors that have enabled its expansion. Third, it turns to some of the main implications of UAVs for the way in which the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) wages war. The article argues that the combined tactical use of UAVs employed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) tasks has amounted to a strategic effect: by dramatically enhancing the field of perception, UAVs have enabled the IDF to better control the battle rhythm. UAVs in the Israeli context have enhanced the IDF's operational sustainability, since one's own casualties have been virtually eliminated and civilian casualties have been stretched out over, rather than concentrated in, time. Throughout the article, the changing character of the UAV is emphasized. To capture this change and to unravel the interactions among technology, warfare and broader societal forces, the article draws on actor-network theory.",Drone,2020
NLFM pulse radar for drone detection using predistortion technique,"The development of radar technology for the detection of small drones is getting attention of researchers. In this work, the detection of drones using Ku-band radar system has been discussed. We have utilized the advantage of nonlinear frequency modulation (NLFM) waveform for the suppression of range sidelobes. The performance and sensitivity of a radar system can be related with the linearity of system response. Here, we have made an effort to minimize non-linearity in the radar system response by using digital predistortion method. In this method, amplitude weighting coefficients have been calculated based on the received data. We have used FPGA-based transceiver for intermediate frequency (IF) signal generation and data acquisition, along with Ku-band up-down converters. The radar system was first calibrated for desired frequency band using amplitude predistortion method. In this article, experiment results for the detection of single drone and two drones using NLFM pulse signal are presented.",Drone,2021
How Photogrammetric Software Works: A Perspective Based on UAV's Exterior Orientation Parameters,"Earlier conventional photogrammetric techniques were used in the topographic mapping using a large format digital camera known as aerial photogrammetry. Recent advancements in UAV technology for photogrammetric purposes have provided a necessity of state-of-the-art photogrammetric software for processing images acquired using UAV. These so-called drones come with an inbuilt GPS and IMU system to geotag the image at the time of acquisition. This information is saved as EXIF data inside the image. There are software programs that provide an end-to-end solution for processing photogrammetric data (UAV-acquired images). This software has the capability of processing data with or without EXIF data. The study provides information related to various camera calibration parameters inside the UAV, and if an externally installed RTK could be useful in generating more accurate deliverables using photogrammetric processing. In UAVs, exterior orientation or EO are saved in both aircraft as well as in gimbal, so through this research, it was tried to look into in-depth of all the black box processes that are going on in the software. This study also provides a solution to the accuracy problems with the UAV-based photogrammetric survey methods.",Drone,2020
Energy-efficient and fault-tolerant drone-BS placement in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks,"This paper introduces a distributed and energy-aware algorithm, called Minimum Drone Placement (MDP) algorithm, to determine the minimum number of base stations mounted on resource-rich Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV-BS), commonly referred to as drone-BS, and their possible locations to provide fault tolerance with high network connectivity in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. This heterogeneous model consists of resource-rich UAV-BSs, acting as gateways of data, as well as ordinary sensor nodes that are supposed to be connected to the UAV-BSs via multi-hop paths. Previous efforts on fault tolerance in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks attempt to determine transmission radii of the sensor nodes based on the already deployed base station positions. They assume that the base stations are stationary and arbitrarily deployed regardless of the position of the sensor nodes. Our proposed MDP algorithm takes into account the desired degree of fault tolerance and the position of ordinary sensor nodes to determine the optimal number of UAV-BSs and their locations. The MDP algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, each sensor node chooses low-cost pairwise disjoint paths to a subset of candidate UAV-BSs, using an optimization based on the well-known set-packing problem. In the last step, depending on the desired degree of fault tolerance, MDP chooses a subset of these UAV-BS candidates using a novel optimization based on the well-known set-cover problem. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the MDP achieves up to 40% improvement in UAV-connected lifetimes compared to a random and uniform distribution of UAV-BSs.",Drone,2021
IMOC: Optimization Technique for Drone-Assisted VANET (DAV) Based on Moth Flame Optimization,"Technology advancement in the field of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) improves smart transportation along with its many other applications. Routing in VANETs is difficult as compared to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs); topological constraints such as high mobility, node density, and frequent path failure make the VANET routing more challenging. To scale complex routing problems, where static and dynamic routings do not work well, AI-based clustering techniques are introduced. Evolutionary algorithm-based clustering techniques are used to solve such routing problems; moth flame optimization is one of them. In this work, an intelligent moth flame optimization-based clustering (IMOC) for a drone-assisted vehicular network is proposed. This technique is used to provide maximum coverage for the vehicular node with minimum cluster heads (CHs) required for routing. Delivering optimal route by providing end-to-end connectivity with minimum overhead is the core issue addressed in this article. Node density, grid size, and transmission ranges are the performance metrics used for comparative analysis. These parameters were varied during simulations for each algorithm, and the results were recorded. A comparison was done with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms for routing such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO), and Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO). Experimental outcomes for IMOC consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art techniques for each scenario. A framework is also proposed with the support of a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to improve routing by minimizing path creation overhead in VANETs. UAV support for clustering improved end-to-end connectivity by keeping the routing cost constant for intercluster communication in the same grid.",Drone,2020
Complete capillary electrophoresis process on a drone: towards a flying micro-lab,"Hazardous remote places exist in the world. Why should health or life be risked sending a scientist to the investigation site, as the remote analytical instrumentation exists? Different scientific fields require instruments that could be used on-site (in situ), therefore the purpose of this work was to design a fully automated chemical analysis system small enough to be mountable on a drone. Here we show an autonomous analytical system with sampling capability on a drone. The system is suited for the remote and autonomous analysis of volatile and non-volatile chemicals in the air. The designed system weighs less than 800 g. Data are transmitted wirelessly. Collected substances are separated automatically without the intervention of the operator using the method of capillary zone electrophoresis. The analytes are detected using a miniaturized contactless conductivity detector quantifying them down to less than 1 mu M. In this work, we demonstrated sampling and separation of volatile amines (triethylamine and diethylamine) and organic acids (acetic and formic acids), non-volatile inorganic cations (K+, Ca2+, Na+), and protein (bovine serum albumin) in the aerosol state. It was shown that the capillary electrophoretic analysis can be performed on a hovering drone. We anticipate our work to be a starting point for more sophisticated, autonomous complex sample analysis. We believe that our designed instrument will enable the investigation of hazardous places in different research fields.",Drone,2020
Auto Neural Architecture Generator for UAV-Based Geospatial Surveillance for Aerial Crisis Mapping in Dark,"Natural disasters such as flood, tsunami, earthquake and cyclones usually influence the microspaces and in urban areas, thereby causing the problem to rescuers to make way to the victims. Rescue operations in these situations are also hampered due to darkness caused by power cut and unavailability of other light sources to rescue people in peril or to even carry out evacuation operations. Therefore, we need solution to map all the essential large-scale feature spaces in dark to avail safety and saving numerous lives in disaster environments. This study presents a soft framework for crisis mapping in dark to map aerial view of geo-specific terrain in disaster struck areas so that effective map of debris and localization of victims can be achieved to enable strategic planning of rescue operations.",Drone,2020
An Adaptive Technique to Detect and Remove Shadow from Drone Data,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)/drones are used to capture and monitor real-time data for various applications. Different sensors may be mounted on the UAV like 4K RGB camera, RedEdge-M and many others. 4K camera is used to capture an image in RGB bands, and RedEdge-M captures an image in five bands namely Blue, Green, Red, RedEdge and Near Infrared having a center wavelength of 475, 560, 668, 717 and 840 nm, respectively. Quality of an image can be judged with its basic two properties, i.e., spatial and spectral information. The images obtained by these sensors are useful for monitoring various targets. One of the most important challenges for any UAV sensor image is a shadow that affects a lot the quality of an image. A shadow can hinder the identification of the target and also affect the vegetation parameters which highly depend on the band values. Huge change in the class labels has been identified during classification because of shadow. Band values can highly suffer from shadow, and thus, it is required to minimize the shadow effect without compromising the image quality. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt has been made to minimize the shadow effect by proposing an algorithm that is based on spatial distribution of neighboring pixels and is compared with other known techniques. The study area chosen is an agriculture field nearby Roorkee region, which lies in the northern part of India having central latitude-longitude as 29.9457 degrees N, 78.1642 degrees E. The images were captured using DJI Phantom 3 pro at an altitude of 100 m which provides a spatial of 0.05 m. It is observed that the proposed method shows better results as compared to others.",Drone,2020
Development of an Open-Source Tool for UAV Photogrammetric Data Processing,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are lightly weighted platforms with numerous advantages and can acquire very high-resolution data rapidly with less expenditure. However, the processing of very high-resolution data acquired through the sensors mounted on the UAV platform is a major challenge, and the commercial UAV data processing software is expensive. These software packages require high-configuration hardware and follow the general workflow of conventional photogrammetric approach for image alignment, point cloud generation, mesh generation, DSM, and ortho-mosaic generation. The integration of computer vision algorithms into digital photogrammetric techniques has made it possible to process the high-resolution datasets quickly. A wide variety of open-source software utilities are available that can perform these tasks individually; however, an integrated solution is always desirable. An attempt is made to develop an open-source tool for photogrammetric processing of UAV data using open-source libraries in Python. The software provides a complete workflow for photogrammetric processing of UAV data ranging from camera calibration, point cloud generation from selective frames based on B/H ratio, direct georeferencing of generated point cloud and digital elevation model (DEM) generation. The developed software is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems and low configuration hardware.",Drone,2020
Design and assessment of octocopter drones with improved aerodynamic efficiency and performance,"This paper summarizes the development of a hybrid approach that integrates textbook methods, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and verification experiments to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency and performance of octocopter drones, which can operate in the low-speed subsonic regime. To rectify the drawbacks of conventional octocopters with monolayer and coaxial configurations, a new octocopter configuration is proposed based on a preliminary aerodynamic consideration of theoretical analysis and a summary of experience. To achieve a systematic and accurate aerodynamic analysis, model analytics are conducted with five different octocopter drone models with three different configurations, including a conventional configuration, a coaxial configuration, and a new configuration. A study is conducted with CFD simulations to investigate the effects of rotor blade size, wind and the interference between rotors on the performance and efficiency of multirotor systems. The new configuration is applied to a realistic vehicle to demonstrate its efficiency. An experiment is carried out to verify the feasibility and technical difficulties of the new configuration octocopter with a traditional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. This research proposes a new configuration octocopter drone with a hybrid method that can create 41.5% more thrust than a coaxially configured octocopter drone with the same rotor blade size and 71% more thrust than a conventionally configured octocopter drone with the same fuselage arm length, where the configuration has no higher standard for the flight control system. The developed configuration can serve as a basis for more detailed, aerodynamic, and performance-enhanced studies in the future with regard to multirotor drones. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Investigation of small-scale propellers under non-axial inflow conditions,"Small-scale propellers, especially those used on conventional multicopter configurations or in the context of urban air mobility, may experience high inflow angles. In order to improve their aerodynamic efficiency, a better understanding of the flow-fields that occur under non-axial inflow conditions is required. Therefore, both isolated and ducted small-scale fixed-pitch propellers are analyzed at a range of inflow angles from zero to 180 degrees, to investigate their steady and temporal resolved loads. Furthermore, the influence of the inflow angle on the flow field is investigated. The load data is also used to simulate the efficiency of different configurative propulsion concepts. The aerodynamics coefficients obtained experimentally, as well as the flow field analysis by particle image velocimetry (PIV), are in close agreement with the unsteady numerical results obtained by URANS calculations.

Versatile implementation of a hardware-software architecture for development and testing of brain-computer interfaces,"Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) have been focused on improving people's lifestyles with motor or communication disabilities. However, the utilization of this technology has found news applications, such as increasing human capacities. Nowadays, several researchers are working on probing human capabilities to control several robotic devices simultaneously. The design of BCI is an intricate work that needs a long time to its implementation. For this reason, an architecture to design and implement different types of BCIs is presented in this article. The architecture has a modular design capable of reading various electroencephalography (EEG) sensors and controlling several robotic devices similar to the plug-and-play paradigm. To test the proposed architecture, a BCI was able to manage a hexapod robot and a drone was implemented. Firstly, a mobile robotic platform was designed and implemented. The BCI is based on eye blinking, where a single blinking represents a robot command. The command orders the robot to initiate or stops their locomotion for the hexapod robot. For the drone, a blink represents the takeoff or landing order. The blinking signals are obtained from the prefrontal and frontal regions of the head by EEG sensors. The signals are then filtered using temporal filters, with cutoff frequencies based on delta, theta, alpha, and beta waves. The filtered signals were labeled and used to train a classifier based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. To generate the robot command, the proposal BCI used two models of MLP to ensure the classifier prediction. So, when the two classifiers make the same prediction, within a defined time interval, send the signal to the robot to start or stop its movement. The obtained results show that it is possible to get high precision to control the hexapod robot with a precision of 91.7% and an average of 81.4%.",Drone,2020
Communication-Efficient Massive UAV Online Path Control: Federated Learning Meets Mean-Field Game Theory,"This paper investigates the control of a massive population of UAVs such as drones. The straightforward method of control of UAVs by considering the interactions among them to make a flock requires a huge inter-UAV communication which is impossible to implement in real-time applications. One method of control is to apply the mean field game (MFG) framework which substantially reduces communications among the UAVs. However, to realize this framework, powerful processors are required to obtain the control laws at different UAVs. This requirement limits the usage of the MFG framework for real-time applications such as massive UAV control. Thus, a function approximator based on neural networks (NN) is utilized to approximate the solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equations. Nevertheless, using an approximate solution can violate the conditions for convergence of the MFG framework. Therefore, the federated learning (FL) approach which can share the model parameters of NNs at drones, is proposed with NN based MFG to satisfy the required conditions. The stability analysis of the NN based MFG approach is presented and the performance of the proposed FL-MFG is elaborated by the simulations.",Drone,2020
Drone-aided routing: A literature review,"The interest in using drones in various applications has grown significantly in recent years. The reasons are related to the continuous advances in technology, especially the advent of fast mi-croprocessors, which support intelligent autonomous control of several systems. Photography, construction, and monitoring and surveillance are only some of the areas in which the use of drones is becoming common. Among these, last-mile delivery is one of the most promising areas. In this work we focus on routing problems with drones, mostly in the context of parcel delivery. We survey and classify the existing works and we provide perspectives for future research.",Drone,2020
An Efficient Privacy-Preserving Authenticated Key Agreement Scheme for Edge-Assisted Internet of Drones,"There has been a a significant increase in the popularity of using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, in several applications. In many application scenarios, UAVs are deployed in missions where sensitive data is collected, such as monitoring critical infrastructure, industrial facilities, crops, and public safety. Due to the sensitive and/or safety critical nature of the data collected in these applications, it is imperative to consider the security, and privacy aspects of the UAVs used in these scenarios. In this article, we propose an efficient privacy aware authenticated key agreement scheme for edge-assisted UAVs (Internet of Drones). Unlike the existing security solutions for UAVs, the proposed scheme does not need to store any secret keys in the devices but still can provide the desired security features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where physical security of the UAV has been taken into account. The proposed system allows third-party communication, and mobile edge computing service providers to authenticate the UAVs without any loss of provacy, and outperforms existing methods in terms of computational complexity.",Drone,2020
Performance Analysis and Cell Association Design for Drone-Assisted Heterogeneous Networks,"Equipped with base station hardware, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can act as drone small cells (DSCs) to complement the traditional terrestrial small cells (TSCs) in providing ubiquitous connectivity for a wide range of applications. Although the performance of drone-assisted heterogeneous networks has been investigated, the state-of-the-art adopts simplified channel models that are not applicable to practical network scenarios. To make an accurate analysis on the network performance, and provide guidelines for the practical design of cell association and network deployment strategy, in this work, we consider a drone-assisted heterogeneous network that employs a flexible biased cell association policy and adopts a more general channel model that incorporates line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) components for both air-to-ground (ATG) and ground-to-ground (GTG) transmissions. We develop a unifying analytical framework to evaluate the network performance in terms of coverage probability, area spectral efficiency (ASE) and user throughput. Our results show that 1) deploying DSCs to complement traditional TSCs can only deteriorate the network performance within the ultra-dense network region, 2) by optimally setting the bias factor for cell association policy, the network performance can be further enhanced.",Drone,2020
Deep Learning for Optimal Deployment of UAVs With Visible Light Communications,"In this paper, the problem of dynamical deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with visible light communication (VLC) capabilities for optimizing the energy efficiency of UAV-enabled networks is studied. In the studied model, the UAVs can simultaneously provide communications and illumination to service ground users. Since ambient illumination increases the interference over VLC links while reducing the illumination threshold of the UAVs, it is necessary to consider the illumination distribution of the target area for UAV deployment optimization. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes UAV deployment, user association, and power efficiency while meeting the illumination and communication requirements of users. To solve this problem, an algorithm that combines the machine learning framework of gated recurrent units (GRUs) with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed. Using GRUs and CNNs, the UAVs can model the long-term historical illumination distribution and predict the future illumination distribution. Given the prediction of illumination distribution, the original nonconvex optimization problem can be divided into two sub-problems and is then solved using a low-complexity, iterative algorithm. Then, the proposed algorithm enables UAVs to determine the their deployment and user association to minimize the total transmit power. Simulation results using real data from the Earth observations group (EOG) at NOAA/NCEI show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 68.9% reduction in total transmit power compared to a conventional optimal UAV deployment that does not consider the illumination distribution and user association.",Drone,2020
Trajectory Design and Power Allocation for Drone-Assisted NR-V2X Network With Dynamic NOMA/OMA,"In this paper, we find trajectory planning and power allocation for a vehicular network in which an unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) is considered as a relay to extend coverage for two disconnected far vehicles. We show that in a two-user network with an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay, non-orthogonal-multiple-access (NOMA) always has better or equal sum-rate in comparison to orthogonal-multiple-access (OMA) at high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. However, for the cases where i) base station (BS)-to-relay link is weak, or ii) two users have similar links, or iii) BS-to-relay link is similar to relay-to-weak user link, applying NOMA has negligible sum-rate gain. Hence, due to the complexity of successive-interference-cancellation (SIC) decoding in NOMA, we propose a dynamic NOMA/OMA scheme in which OMA mode is selected for transmission when applying NOMA has only negligible gain. Also, we show that OMA always has better min-rate than NOMA at high SNR regime. Further, we formulate two optimization problems which maximize the sum-rate and min-rate of the two vehicles. These problems are non-convex, and hence we propose an iterative algorithm based on alternating-optimization (AO) method which solves trajectory and power allocation sub-problems by successive-convex-approximation (SCA) and difference-of-convex (DC) methods, respectively. Finally, the above-mentioned performance is confirmed by simulations.",Drone,2020
Wireless Networks With Cache-Enabled and Backhaul-Limited Aerial Base Stations,"Use of aerial base stations (ABSs) is a promising approach to enhance the agility and flexibility of future wireless networks. ABSs can improve the coverage and/or capacity of a network by moving supply towards demand. Deploying ABSs in a network presents several challenges such as finding an efficient 3D-placement of ABSs that takes network objectives into account. Another challenge is the limited wireless backhaul capacity of ABSs and consequently, potentially higher latency incurred. Content caching is proposed to alleviate the backhaul congestion and decrease the latency. We consider a limited backhaul capacity for ABSs due to varying position-dependent path loss values and define two groups of users (delay-tolerant and delay-sensitive) with different data rate requirements. We study the problem of jointly determining backhaul-aware 3D placement for ABSs, user-BS associations and corresponding bandwidth allocations while minimizing total downlink transmit power. Proposed iterative algorithm applies a decomposition method. First, the 3D locations of ABSs are found using semi-definite relaxation and coordinate descent methods, and then user-BS associations and bandwidth allocations are optimized. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and provide insights about the impact of traffic distribution and content caching on transmit power and backhaul usage of ABSs.",Drone,2020
Always-On 674 mu W@4GOP/s Error Resilient Binary Neural Networks With Aggressive SRAM Voltage Scaling on a 22-nm IoT End-Node,"Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have been shown to be robust to random bit-level noise, making aggressive voltage scaling attractive as a power-saving technique for both logic and SRAMs. In this work, we introduce the first fully programmable IoT end-node system-on-chip (SoC) capable of executing software-defined, hardware-accelerated BNNs at ultra-low voltage. Our SoC exploits a hybrid memory scheme where error-vulnerable SRAMs are complemented by reliable standard-cell memories to safely store critical data under aggressive voltage scaling. On a prototype in 22nm FDX technology, we demonstrate that both the logic and SRAM voltage can be dropped to 0.5V without any accuracy penalty on a BNN trained for the CIFAR-10 dataset, improving energy efficiency by 2.2X w.r. t. nominal conditions. Furthermore, we show that the supply voltage can be dropped to 0.42V (50% of nominal) while keeping more than 99% of the nominal accuracy (with a bit error rate similar to 1/1000). In this operating point, our prototype performs 4Gop/ s (15.4 Inference/s on the CIFAR-10 dataset) by computing up to 13 binary ops per pJ, achieving 22.8 Inference/s/mW while keeping within a peak power envelope of 674uW - low enough to enable always-on operation in ultra-low power smart cameras, long-lifetime environmental sensors, and insect-sized pico-drones.",Drone,2020
Vehicle path reconstruction using Recursively Ensembled Low-pass filter (RELP) and adaptive tri-cubic kernel smoother,"Accurate information of path followed by vehicles at several real-life scenarios is essential for modeling and testing the optimal path for autonomous vehicles, analyzing the lateral dynamics such as lane-changing and overtaking, vehicle dynamics at the horizontal curves, intersections, and roundabouts. Recently, the availability of such data is plenty, thanks to the advancements in drone and computer-vision technologies. Nevertheless, extracting useful information from the observed data requires certain pre-processing that can handle the noises added at several stages of the data collection. The adequacy of the existing off-the-shelf smoothing techniques (e.g., Moving average, Savitzky-Golay, Kalman filter) for denoising the trajectory data of the modern era is certainly a question. The motivation for the present study is twofold. Firstly, the challenges of contemporary trajectory data collection and associated error patterns are relatively unknown, and thus an appropriate denoising technique needs to be developed. Secondly, many of the existing smoothing techniques have chosen invariant parameters across all the vehicle paths, even though the error patterns are dissimilar across the vehicles and, in the longitudinal and lateral directions. Thus, an adaptive smoothing needs to be applied for each observed vehicle path and its components. The present study proposes an adaptive, and data-driven path smoothing technique that can be universally applied to the video-based path data obtained from any camera platform (either drone or fixed camera setup). The proposed reconstruction framework works in three-stages; in the first stage, the data is prepared by resampling any missing data. Also, any outlier in the observed path data is identified and removed at this stage. In the second stage, a Recursively Ensembled Low-Pass (RELP) filter is proposed to handle the 'heavily tailed' noise found in the video-processing based trajectory data, particularly for drone videos. A robust adaptive Gaussian kernel smoothing is applied in the third stage to have a localized reconstruction. For Kernel smoothing, the smoothing parameters such as the optimal bandwidth and polynomial order are estimated using the proposed grid-search algorithm. The parameter estimation process ensures that the bias and variance are perfectly traded-off to achieve a smooth vehicle path. The performance evaluation of the proposed method shows an internally and physically consistent trajectory reconstruction.",Drone,2020
Degradation and Dependence Analysis of a Lithium-Ion Battery Pack in the Unbalanced State,"Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in the energy field due to their high efficiency and clean characteristics. They provide more possibilities for electric vehicles, drones, and other applications, and they can provide the higher requirements necessary for the reliability of battery pack systems. However, it is easy for a battery pack to be unbalanced because of the dependence between the cells. The unbalanced state will make the degradation process more complex and cause abnormal discharge parameters, which brings challenges in the analysis of the state of health (SOH) of battery packs. In order to study the degradation process in the unbalanced condition, in this study, a degradation test of four different configurations of battery packs was designed and implemented, and the degradation process was primarily studied from the perspective of dependence. First, the degradation characteristics and dependency degree of different configurations of the unbalanced state were discussed. Second, a hypothesis test and a linear regression analysis were used to analyze the degradation process and the acceleration effect of a battery pack in the unbalanced state. Finally, partial least squares regression was used to establish the dependence model of battery packs in the unbalanced state. A high regression coefficient (R-2 > 0.9) and low p-value < 0.0001 indicated that the correlation of the degradation process was effectively quantified. The results provide a reference for optimizing a consistent design of battery packs and managing the SOH of battery packs.",Drone,2020
Quantum-Like Interdependence Theory Advances Autonomous Human-Machine Teams (A-HMTs),"As humanity grapples with the concept of autonomy for human-machine teams (A-HMTs), unresolved is the necessity for the control of autonomy that instills trust. For non-autonomous systems in states with a high degree of certainty, rational approaches exist to solve, model or control stable interactions; e.g., game theory, scale-free network theory, multi-agent systems, drone swarms. As an example, guided by artificial intelligence (AI, including machine learning, ML) or by human operators, swarms of drones have made spectacular gains in applications too numerous to list (e.g., crop management; mapping, surveillance and fire-fighting systems; weapon systems). But under states of uncertainty or where conflict exists, rational models fail, exactly where interdependence theory thrives. Large, coupled physical or information systems can also experience synergism or dysergism from interdependence. Synergistically, the best human teams are not only highly interdependent, but they also exploit interdependence to reduce uncertainty, the focus of this work-in-progress and roadmap. We have long argued that interdependence is fundamental to human autonomy in teams. But for A-HMTs, no mathematics exists to build from rational theory or social science for their design nor safe or effective operation, a severe weakness. Compared to the rational and traditional social theory, we hope to advance interdependence theory first by mapping similarities between quantum theory and our prior findings; e.g., to maintain interdependence, we previously established that boundaries reduce dysergic effects to allow teams to function (akin to blocking interference to prevent quantum decoherence). Second, we extend our prior findings with case studies to predict with interdependence theory that as uncertainty increases in non-factorable situations for humans, the duality in two-sided beliefs serves debaters who explore alternatives with tradeoffs in the search for the best path going forward. Third, applied to autonomous teams, we conclude that a machine in an A-HMT must be able to express itself to its human teammates in causal language however imperfectly.",Drone,2020
Automated Sustainable Multi-Object Segmentation and Recognition via Modified Sampling Consensus and Kernel Sliding Perceptron,"Object recognition in depth images is challenging and persistent task in machine vision, robotics, and automation of sustainability. Object recognition tasks are a challenging part of various multimedia technologies for video surveillance, human-computer interaction, robotic navigation, drone targeting, tourist guidance, and medical diagnostics. However, the symmetry that exists in real-world objects plays a significant role in perception and recognition of objects in both humans and machines. With advances in depth sensor technology, numerous researchers have recently proposed RGB-D object recognition techniques. In this paper, we introduce a sustainable object recognition framework that is consistent despite any change in the environment, and can recognize and analyze RGB-D objects in complex indoor scenarios. Firstly, after acquiring a depth image, the point cloud and the depth maps are extracted to obtain the planes. Then, the plane fitting model and the proposed modified maximum likelihood estimation sampling consensus (MMLESAC) are applied as a segmentation process. Then, depth kernel descriptors (DKDES) over segmented objects are computed for single and multiple object scenarios separately. These DKDES are subsequently carried forward to isometric mapping (IsoMap) for feature space reduction. Finally, the reduced feature vector is forwarded to a kernel sliding perceptron (KSP) for the recognition of objects. Three datasets are used to evaluate four different experiments by employing a cross-validation scheme to validate the proposed model. The experimental results over RGB-D object, RGB-D scene, and NYUDv1 datasets demonstrate overall accuracies of 92.2%, 88.5%, and 90.5% respectively. These results outperform existing state-of-the-art methods and verify the suitability of the method.",Drone,2020
Non-Uniform Discretization-based Ordinal Regression for Monocular Depth Estimation of an Indoor Drone,"At present, the main methods of solving the monocular depth estimation for indoor drones are the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm and the deep learning algorithm. SLAM requires the construction of a depth map of the unknown environment, which is slow to calculate and generally requires expensive sensors, whereas current deep learning algorithms are mostly based on binary classification or regression. The output of the binary classification model gives the decision algorithm relatively rough control over the unmanned aerial vehicle. The regression model solves the problem of the binary classification, but it carries out the same processing for long and short distances, resulting in a decline in short-range prediction performance. In order to solve the above problems, according to the characteristics of the strong order correlation of the distance value, we propose a non-uniform spacing-increasing discretization-based ordinal regression algorithm (NSIDORA) to solve the monocular depth estimation for indoor drone tasks. According to the security requirements of this task, the distance label of the data set is discretized into three major areas-the dangerous area, decision area, and safety area-and the decision area is discretized based on spacing-increasing discretization. Considering the inconsistency of ordinal regression, a new distance decoder is produced. Experimental evaluation shows that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of NSIDORA in the decision area is 33.5% lower than that of non-uniform discretization (NUD)-based ordinal regression methods. Although it is higher overall than that of the state-of-the-art two-stream regression algorithm, the RMSE of the NSIDORA in the top 10 categories of the decision area is 21.8% lower than that of the two-stream regression algorithm. The inference speed of NSIDORA is 3.4 times faster than that of two-stream ordinal regression. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the decoder has been proved through ablation experiments.",Drone,2020
Optrone: Maximizing Performance and Energy Resources of Drone Batteries,"The optimal use of batteries in drones is a critical issue for achieving both reliable operation and maximum flight time. The key is to acquire accurate information about the state of charge (SoC) of the battery in runtime. Drones typically employ series-connected lithium-ion polymer (Li-Po) battery cells, whose SoC is affected by many environmental factors as well as flight patterns. In this article, we propose a scheme, called Optrone, which maximizes the flight time of a drone while safely using the battery. Understanding the implications of the factors affecting the SoC of the drone's battery pack, we propose a three-level SoC, which is a metric for representing the SoC of a battery in runtime. We also provide various operating policies to users to improve the safety and efficiency of operating the drone. We implemented the prototype hardware and software for Optrone, and validated its operation in controlled and real environments. The experimental results in a controlled environment showed that the proposed three-level SoC poses less than 3% error and the operating policies achieved a flight time gain of 19.4%, while guaranteeing battery safety. We also observed a flight time gain of about 10% in real outdoor experiments, where the user rightly adheres to the advised Optrone policy.",Drone,2020
FFAU-Framework for Fully Autonomous UAVs,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), although hardly a new technology, have recently gained a prominent role in many industries being widely used not only among enthusiastic consumers, but also in high demanding professional situations, and will have a massive societal impact over the coming years. However, the operation of UAVs is fraught with serious safety risks, such as collisions with dynamic obstacles (birds, other UAVs, or randomly thrown objects). These collision scenarios are complex to analyze in real-time, sometimes being computationally impossible to solve with existing State of the Art (SoA) algorithms, making the use of UAVs an operational hazard and therefore significantly reducing their commercial applicability in urban environments. In this work, a conceptual framework for both stand-alone and swarm (networked) UAVs is introduced, with a focus on the architectural requirements of the collision avoidance subsystem to achieve acceptable levels of safety and reliability. The SoA principles for collision avoidance against stationary objects are reviewed and a novel approach is described, using deep learning techniques to solve the computational intensive problem of real-time collision avoidance with dynamic objects. The proposed framework includes a web-interface allowing the full control of UAVs as remote clients with a supervisor cloud-based platform. The feasibility of the proposed approach was demonstrated through experimental tests using a UAV, developed from scratch using the proposed framework. Test flight results are presented for an autonomous UAV monitored from multiple countries across the world.",Drone,2020
"A comprehensive review of energy sources for unmanned aerial vehicles, their shortfalls and opportunities for improvements.","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles were first introduced almost 40 years ago and their applications have increased and diversified substantially since then, in both commercial and private use. One of the UAVs main issues when it comes to mobility is that the power sources available are inadequate, this highlights an area for improvement as the interest in drones is on the increase. There exist many different types of power supplies applied to UAVs, however each has their own limitations and strengths that pertain to weight contributions, charging and discharging times, size, payload capabilities, energy density and power density. The aim of this paper is to review the main power sources available for UAVs, determine their shortfalls, compare the power sources with each other and offer suggestions as to how they can be improved - hence identifying where the gap lies for developing better alternative power sources.",Drone,2020
Spoofing Attack on Ultrasonic Distance Sensors Using a Continuous Signal,"Ultrasonic distance sensors use an ultrasonic pulse's time of flight to calculate the distance to the reflecting object. Widely used in industry, these sensors are an important component in autonomous vehicles, where they are used for such tasks as object avoidance and altitude measurement. The proper operation of such autonomous vehicles relies on sensor measurements; therefore, an adversary that has the ability to undermine the sensor's reliability can pose a major risk to the vehicle. Previous attempts to alter the measurements of this sensor using an external signal succeeded in performing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, in which the sensor's reading showed a constant value, and a spoofing attack, in which the attacker could control the measurement to some extent. However, these attacks require precise knowledge of the sensor and its operation (e.g., timing of the ultrasonic pulse sent by the sensor). In this paper, we present an attack on ultrasonic distance sensors in which the measured distance can be altered (i.e., spoofing attack). The attack exploits a vulnerability discovered in the ultrasonic sensor's receiver that results in a fake pulse that is produced by a constant noise in the input. A major advantage of the proposed attack is that, unlike previous attacks, a constant signal is used, and therefore, no prior knowledge of the sensor's relative location or its timing behavior is required. We demonstrate the attack in both a lab setup (testbed) and a real setup involving a drone to demonstrate its feasibility. Our experiments show that the attack can interfere with the proper operation of the vehicle. In addition to the risk that the attack poses to autonomous vehicles, it can also be used as an effective defensive tool for restricting the movement of unauthorized autonomous vehicles within a protected area.",Drone,2020
FerroElectronics for Edge Intelligence,"The future data-centric world demands edge intelligence (EI) - the ability to analyze data locally and to decide on a course of action autonomously. Challenges with Moore's Law scaling and limitations of von Neumann computing architectures are limiting the performance and energy efficiency of conventional electronics. Promising new discoveries of advanced CMOS-compatible HfO2-based ferroelectric devices open the door for FerroElectronics; electronics based on ferroelectric building blocks integrated on advanced CMOS technology nodes. It will enable much needed improvement in computing capabilities making EI a reality. In-memory computing in data-flow architectures is at the core of FerroElectronics. This approach will enable building 1000X more compute-energy-efficient small-system AI engines needed for EI. Smart edge intelligent IoT devices enable new applications, for example, micro Drones(uDrones), that demand higher performance to support local embedded intelligence, real-time learning, and autonomy. They will drive the next phase of growth in the semiconductor industry.",Drone,2020
CFD analysis of the aerodynamic effects on the stability of the flight of a quadcopter UAV in the proximity of walls and ground,"Quadcopters are attracting a growing interest in many applications such as cargo delivery or surfaces inspection. These applications are often subjected to flights in the proximity of walls or ground that generate external forces and torques on the vehicle due to aerodynamic effects, because of what strong safety guarantees are required. In this research a methodology based on dynamic meshes was developed and applied to computational simulations to reproduce the flight of the drone over an obstacle. Thus, the effect of the ground proximity on the drone performance was assessed, and also its combination with the flow around the body at different translational velocities. The results shown a decrease of the drag force, and an increase of the lift and forward pitch moment due to the presence of the ground. These effects are magnified by the translational velocity, which also deviates the flow generated by the propellers and delays the interaction with the obstacle. Both in the approaching and leaving to the obstacle, increases of up to 60% in the pitch moment are observed. This sudden variations must be properly counteracted to guarantee the stability and safety of the drone operation.",Drone,2020
Geometric and constrained control for a string of tethered drones,"In this study, we present a novel concept of a multi tethered drone system. The system includes an arbitrary number of drones connected serially to an active ground station. The considered drones are of quadrotor type. Utilizing a unique pulley-gimbal mechanism, each drone can freely move along the tether, and its state is measured with respect to the ground station without the use of standard onboard inertial sensors or GPS. The proposed system can be thought of as a robotic arm where each tether section acts as a variable-length link and each drone is a joint actuator. We model the coupled behavior of the ground station and the string, taking into account an arbitrary number of drones. Then, a controller that combines tools from geometric-control and Model Predictive Control is suggested. The developed model and control approach are also applicable for other swarm applications where the position of agents is to be controlled to a string-like form. Finally, the concept is demonstrated using numerical simulations and an initial experiment, which illustrate its potential effectiveness. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Autonomous drone race: A computationally efficient vision-based navigation and control strategy,"Drone racing is becoming a popular sport where human pilots have to control their drones to fly at high speed through complex environments and pass a number of gates in a pre-defined sequence. In this paper, we develop an autonomous system for drones to race fully autonomously using only onboard resources. Instead of commonly used visual navigation methods, such as simultaneous localization and mapping and visual inertial odometry, which are computationally expensive for micro aerial vehicles (MAVs), we developed the highly efficient snake gate detection algorithm for visual navigation, which can detect the gate at 20 HZ on a Parrot Bebop drone. Then, with the gate detection result, we developed a robust pose estimation algorithm which has better tolerance to detection noise than a state-of-the-art perspective-n-point method. During the race, sometimes the gates are not in the drone's field of view. For this case, a state prediction-based feed-forward control strategy is developed to steer the drone to fly to the next gate. Experiments show that the drone can fly a half-circle with 1.5 m radius within 2 s with only 30 cm error at the end of the circle without any position feedback. Finally, the whole system is tested in a complex environment (a showroom in the faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft). The result shows that the drone can complete the track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5 m/s which is faster than the speeds exhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.

An Experimental Analysis on Propeller Performance in a Climate-controlled Facility,"Despite many commercial applications make extensive use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), there is still lack of published data about their performance under unconventional weather conditions. In the last years, multirotors and fixed wing vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, have been studied in wind environments so that stability and controllability have been improved. However, other important weather variables have impact on UAS performance and they should be properly investigated for a deeper understanding of such vehicles. The primary objective of our study is the preliminary characterization of a propeller in a climate-controlled chamber. Mechanical and electrical data have been measured while testing the propeller at low pressure and cold temperatures. Test results point out that thrust and electric power are strongly affected by air density. A comparison between the experimental data and the results of the Blade Element Theory is carried out to assess the theory capability to estimate thrust in unconventional environments. The overlap between experimental data and theory computation is appropriate despite geometrical uncertainties and corroborate the need of a reliable aerodynamic database. Propeller performance data under unconventional atmospheres will be leveraged to improve UAS design, propulsion system modelling as well as provide guidelines to certify operations in extreme environments.",Drone,2020

The drone threat to just war theory: responding to Braun,"In this response to Christian Braun's essay in this journal, I argue that the rise of drone warfare against terrorism suggests the necessity of the presumption against war (not its limit) and use the issue to advance this broader debate within just war theory at a pivotal moment in the tradition.",Drone,2020
Surface temperature effects of solar panels of fixed-wing drones on drag reduction and energy consumption,"In this paper, the thermal effects of solar panels are investigated experimentally and computationally on the efficiency of an Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) in laminar and turbulent flows. At first, the impact of temperature on output power and efficiency of an eFlex 30 Wp solar panel is studied. Then, the surface temperature and output voltage of two different types of solar panels, a flexible and a solid panel, are measured under a heat lamp. The heat lamp provides the radiation and raises the temperature of the solar panels. A thermal camera and laser thermometer are used to measure the surface temperature of the solar panels. Considering a tilt-rotor UAV as a case study, an energy balance is modeled for the wing of UAV, which is assumed as a flat plate. Applying the Blasius boundary layer for laminar flow and 1/5 power law for turbulent flow, it is shown that there is skin friction drag changes on the top surface of the solar panel due to its dark blue color. In order to validate the results of the proposed model, a thermal-fluid study is carried out on the NACA 2412 airfoil through COMSOL to see whether changing the surface temperature on the solar panel relates to skin drag reduction. The results indicate that an increase in the surface temperature of the solar panel will decrease the output power and efficiency to a maximum of 8%; while this increase in temperature reduces drag by up to 10% in laminar flow. This research shows that despite the reduction of efficiency and generated power by solar panels with increasing the surface temperature on top of a UAV, the aerodynamic efficiency can be improved with drag reduction in laminar flow.",Drone,2021
Bioinspired wing and tail morphing extends drone flight capabilities,"The aerodynamic designs of winged drones are optimized for specific flight regimes. Large lifting surfaces provide maneuverability and agility but result in larger power consumption, and thus lower range, when flying fast compared with small lifting surfaces. Birds like the northern goshawk meet these opposing aerodynamic requirements of aggressive flight in dense forests and fast cruising in the open terrain by adapting wing and tail areas. Here, we show that this morphing strategy and the synergy of the two morphing surfaces can notably improve the agility, maneuverability, stability, flight speed range, and required power of a drone in different flight regimes by means of an avian-inspired drone. We characterize the drone's flight capabilities for different morphing configurations in wind tunnel tests, optimization studies, and outdoor flight tests. These results shed light on the avian use of wings and tails and offer an alternative design principle for drones with adaptive flight capabilities.",Drone,2020
A FPGA-based accelerated architecture for the Continuous GRASP,"This work proposes a FPGA-based architecture for accelerating the Continuous GRASP (C-GRASP), a prominent metaheuristic for solving continuous optimization problems. Although FPGA implementations have been proposed for other metaheuristics, nothing has been done for C-GRASP. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on well-known hard test problems, and compare our FPGA architecture with C-GRASP implementations running on four other architectures: a single-core ARM Cortex A9-based, a single-core Intel i7-based, a multi-core Intel i7-based, and a GPU-based. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms the others in terms of performance-to-power-efficiency. For instance, it is on average 3x faster and 15x less power consuming than the single-core Intel i7-based implementation. Moreover, we introduce a model-based method that helps designers with little experience in FPGA development to use our high-performance architecture to optimize their problem. Our solution is a very interesting option for the emerging technology of FPGA-based data centers (e.g, Microsoft's Catapult project), and also for resource-constrained embedded systems (e.g., drones).",Drone,2020
Detection of REEs with lightweight UAV-based hyperspectral imaging,"Rare earth elements (REEs) supply is important to ensure the energy transition, e-mobility and ultimately to achieve the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Conventional exploration techniques usually rely on substantial geological field work including dense in-situ sampling with long delays until provision of analytical results. However, this approach is limited by land accessibility, financial status, climate and public opposition. Efficient and innovative methods are required to mitigate these limitations. The use of lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provides a unique opportunity to conduct rapid and non-invasive exploration even in socially sensitive areas and in relatively inaccessible locations. We employ drones with hyperspectral sensors to detect REEs at the earth's surface and thus contribute to a rapidly evolving field at the cutting edge of exploration technologies. We showcase for the first time the direct mapping of REEs with lightweight hyperspectral UAV platforms. Our solution has the advantage of quick turn-around times (< 1 d), low detection limits (< 200 ppm for Nd) and is ideally suited to support exploration campaigns. This procedure was successfully tested and validated in two areas: Marinkas Quellen, Namibia, and Siilinjarvi, Finland. This strategy should invigorate the use of drones in exploration and for the monitoring of mining activities.",Drone,2020
Generation of tunable linearly chirped signals with long temporal duration in the photonic time-stretched coherent radar,"Linearly chirped signals with long temporal duration are generated by adding a dispersive loop in the photonic time-stretched coherent radar. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation of the optical pulse recirculation is analyzed and simulated to evaluate the multiple extension of temporal duration. The achievable temporal duration is confined by the dispersion and the amplified spontaneous emission noise accumulation. The experimental results verify the SNR variation of the optical pulse recirculation. Moreover, tunable linearly chirped signals with temporal duration of 100 ns and a bandwidth of 4 GHz at X or Ku band are generated. With the improvement of the time-bandwidth product, a drone can be successfully observed. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America",Drone,2020
Bidirectional Core Sandwich Structure of Reduced Graphene Oxide and Spinnable Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding Effectiveness,"Thin and flexible electromagnetic shielding materials have recently emerged because of their promising applications in drones, portable electronics, military defense facilities, etc. This research develops an electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding material by a bidirectional lattice sandwich structure (BLSS), which is formed by liquid crystalline graphene oxide (LCGO) and an orthogonal pattern of spinnable multiwalled (OPSM) nanotubes in consideration of the movement of electromagnetic waves. The average EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the developed material with 0.5 wt % reduced LCGO (r-LCGO) and an OPSM nanotube composed of 64 layers was approximately 66.1 dB in the X-band frequency range (8.2-12.4 GHz, wavelength: 3.5-2.5 cm), which corresponds to a shielding efficiency of 99.9999%. Also, its absorption effectiveness is 99.7% of the total EMI SE, indicating that it has a remarkable ability to prevent secondary damage induced by EM reflection. The specific EMI SE (SSE/t) of the composite material considering the contribution of thickness (t) ranged from 21 953 to 2259 dB cm(2)/g.",Drone,2020
Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Cognitive Map-Based Flight Control System for Quadcopters,"In this paper, we propose a novel Interval Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM)-based flight control system to solve the altitude, attitude and position control problems of quadcopters. The proposed IT2-FCM encompasses all concepts related to drone for a satisfactory path-tracking and stabilizing control performance. The degree of mutual influences of the concepts is designed with opinions of three experts that take account the dynamics of drone and rules governing proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. To model the inter-uncertainty of the experts' opinions, IT2 fuzzy logic systems are utilized as they are powerful tools to model high level of uncertainties. Thus, the proposed IT2-FCM has a qualitative representation as it merges the advantages of IT2 fuzzy logic systems and FCMs. We present comparative simulations results in presence of uncertainties where the superiority of the proposed IT2-FCM-based flight control system is shown in comparison with its type-1 fuzzy counterpart.",Drone,2020
Object Detection from the Video Taken by Drone via Convolutional Neural Networks,"The aim of this research is to show the implementation of object detection on drone videos using TensorFlow object detection API. The function of the research is the recognition effect and performance of the popular target detection algorithm and feature extractor for recognizing people, trees, cars, and buildings from real-world video frames taken by drones. The study found that using different target detection algorithms on the ""normal"" image (an ordinary camera) has different performance effects on the number of instances, detection accuracy, and performance consumption of the target and the application of the algorithm to the image data acquired by the drone is different. Object detection is a key part of the realization of any robot's complete autonomy, while unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a very active area of this field. In order to explore the performance of the most advanced target detection algorithm in the image data captured by UAV, we have done a lot of experiments to solve our functional problems and compared two different types of representative of the most advanced convolution target detection systems, such as SSD and Faster R-CNN, with MobileNet, GoogleNet/Inception, and ResNet50 base feature extractors.",Drone,2020
CNN-based single object detection and tracking in videos and its application to drone detection,"This paper presents convolutional neural network (CNN)-based single object detection and tracking algorithms. CNN-based object detection methods are directly applicable to static images, but not to videos. On the other hand, model-free visual object tracking methods cannot detect an object until a ground truth bounding box of the target is provided. Moreover, many annotated video datasets of the target object are required to train both the object detectors and visual trackers. In this work, three simple yet effective object detection and tracking algorithms for videos are proposed to efficiently combine a state-of-the-art object detector and visual tracker for circumstances in which only a few static images of the target are available for training. The proposed algorithms are tested using a drone detection task and the experimental results demonstrated their effectiveness.",Drone,2020
A survey on recent optimal techniques for securingunmanned aerial vehiclesapplications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or Drones technology has a huge potential for supporting different efficient solutions for the smart applications in our world. The applications include smart things, smart transportation, smart cities, smart healthcare, smart personal care, smart house, smart industries, and so on. Due to the sensitive applications of UAVs, the security has become a major concern, and therefore, efficient techniques are required to protect captured data from hackers and the fictitious activities from illegitimate users. Machine learning (ML) techniques play a vital role in improving UAVs' security intelligently, while blockchain is recent technology for decentralized UAVs and security. Furthermore, watermarking guarantees digital media to be authenticated, protected, and copyright. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive survey of optimal techniques, which are used for securing UAVs applications in terms of blockchain, ML, and watermarking. Furthermore, we introduce each technique with the advantages and suitably used for securing UAVs collaboration applications. This survey contributes to a better understanding of the blockchain, ML, and watermarking techniques for securing UAVs and sheds new light on challenges and opportunities on subject applications.",Drone,2020
Modeling and Predicting Trust Dynamics in Human-Robot Teaming: A Bayesian Inference Approach,"Trust in automation, or more recently trust in autonomy, has received extensive research attention in the past three decades. The majority of prior literature adopted a ""snapshot"" view of trust and typically evaluated trust through questionnaires administered at the end of an experiment. This ""snapshot"" view, however, does not acknowledge that trust is a dynamic variable that can strengthen or decay over time. To fill the research gap, the present study aims to model trust dynamics when a human interacts with a robotic agent over time. The underlying premise of the study is that by interacting with a robotic agent and observing its performance over time, a rational human agent will update his/her trust in the robotic agent accordingly. Based on this premise, we develop a personalized trust prediction model and learn its parameters using Bayesian inference. Our proposed model adheres to three properties of trust dynamics characterizing human agents' trust development processde factoand thus guarantees high model explicability and generalizability. We tested the proposed method using an existing dataset involving 39 human participants interacting with four drones in a simulated surveillance mission. The proposed method obtained a root mean square error of 0.072, significantly outperforming existing prediction methods. Moreover, we identified three distinct types of trust dynamics, the Bayesian decision maker, the oscillator, and the disbeliever, respectively. This prediction model can be used for the design of individualized and adaptive technologies.",Drone,2020

We highlight these far-reaching consequences and provide a rich future research trajectory aimed to further theory development on the emerging phenomenon of drones.",Drone,2020
Experimental investigation of fuel cell usage on an air Vehicle's hybrid propulsion system,"Today, drones are offering a key solution and being preferable more and more by governments and companies for military and commercial usage. One of the biggest handicaps to the more widespread usage of drones is insufficient flight time and weight issues.

In this experimental study, a hybrid propulsion system is designed using fuel cell and battery to increase the flight time of a quadcopter. This hybrid propulsion system mainly consists of 30 W polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), compressed hydrogen tank, lithium-polymer battery and 4 brushless motors that drive propeller. As a result of the test flights done in flight route, some parameters like endurance, energy consumption and hydrogen consumption are analyzed; by the way obtained results are graphed comparatively. Consequently, when the fuel cell is used, an improvement of approximately 2 min in total 12 flight tests is achieved. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

New Approach of UAV Movement Detection and Characterization Using Advanced Signal Processing Methods Based on UWB Sensing,"In the last years, the commercial drone/unmanned aerial vehicles market has grown due to their technological performances (provided by the multiple onboard available sensors), low price, and ease of use.

An Investigation of Rotary Drone HERM Line Spectrum under Manoeuvering Conditions,"Detecting and identifying drones is of great interest due to the proliferation of highly manoeuverable drones with on-board sensors of increasing sensing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the use of radars for tackling this problem. In particular, we focus on the problem of detecting rotary drones and distinguishing between single-propeller and multi-propeller drones using a micro-Doppler analysis. Two different radars were used, an ultra wideband (UWB) continuous wave (CW) C-band radar and an automotive frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) W-band radar, to collect micro-Doppler signatures of the drones. By taking a closer look at HElicopter Rotor Modulation (HERM) lines, the spool and chopping lines are identified for the first time in the context of drones to determine the number of propeller blades. Furthermore, a new multi-frequency analysis method using HERM lines is developed, which allows the detection of propeller rotation rates (spool and chopping frequencies) of single and multi-propeller drones. Therefore, the presented method is a promising technique to aid in the classification of drones.",Drone,2020
"RGIM: An Integrated Approach to Improve QoS in AODV, DSR and DSDV Routing Protocols for FANETS Using the Chain Mobility Model","Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are a collection of unmanned aerial vehicles that communicate without any predefined infrastructure. FANET, being one of the most researched topics nowadays, finds its scope in many complex applications like drones used for military applications, border surveillance systems and other systems like civil applications in traffic monitoring and disaster management. Quality of service (QoS) performance parameters for routing e.g. delay, packet delivery ratio, jitter and throughput in FANETs are quite difficult to improve. Mobility models play an important role in evaluating the performance of the routing protocols. In this paper, the integration of two selected mobility models, i.e. random waypoint and Gauss-Markov model, is implemented. As a result, the random Gauss integrated model is proposed for evaluating the performance of AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector), DSR (dynamic source routing) and DSDV (destination-Sequenced distance vector) routing protocols. The simulation is done with an NS2 simulator for various scenarios by varying the number of nodes and taking low- and high-node speeds of 50 and 500, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed model improves the QoS performance parameters of AODV, DSR and DSDV protocol.",Drone,2020
Drone swarm patrolling with uneven coverage requirements,"Swarms of drones are being more and more used in many practical scenarios, such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, search and rescue in hardly-accessible areas and so on. While a single drone can be guided by a human operator, the deployment of a swarm of multiple drones requires proper algorithms for automatic task-oriented control. In this study, the authors focus on visual coverage optimisation with drone-mounted camera sensors. In particular, they consider the specific case in which the coverage requirements are uneven, meaning that different parts of the environment have different coverage priorities. They model these coverage requirements with relevance maps and propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to guide the swarm. This study first defines a proper learning model for a single drone, and then extends it to the case of multiple drones both with greedy and cooperative strategies. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method, also compared with a standard patrolling algorithm.",Drone,2020
AirNet: Energy-Aware Deployment and Scheduling of Aerial Networks,"Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) promise resilient and perpetual connectivity after unexpected events such as natural disasters. However, the deployment and scheduling of ABSs introduce several algorithmic challenges. In particular, on-demand communication can change over time and be hard to accurately predict, so it needs to be handled in an online manner, accounting also for battery consumption constraints. This paper presents AirNet, an efficient software-based solution to operate ABSs whichmeet these requirements. AirNet is based on an efficient placement algorithm for ABSs which maximizes the number of covered users, and a scheduler which navigates and recharges ABSs in an energy-aware manner. To this end, we propose an energy-aware deployment algorithm and use an energy model to analyze the power consumption and thereby, improve the flight endurance. In addition, we evaluate a novel scheduling mechanism that efficiently manages the ABSs' operations. Our simulations indicate that our approach can significantly improve the flight endurance and user coverage compared to a recent state-of-the-art approach.",Drone,2020
A Novel Distributed Algorithm for Phase Synchronization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In this letter, the problem of phase synchronization for a group of drones acting as relays to build a connection between a base station (BS) and a ground receiver (GR) is investigated. The received signal strength (RSS) of the GR significantly degrades due to phase-mismatch caused by mobility of the drones. To tackle this challenge, a distributed synchronization algorithm that utilizes a few feedbacks is proposed and its convergence is proved for a specified bound on the frequency deviation. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the received signal strength (RSS) of the GR is presented assuming different deviation frequencies and number of drones. Provided simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of synchronizing the drones' phases for all the considered deviation frequencies and number of drones. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the existing cumulative positive one-bit feedback based approaches in terms of convergence speed and RSS, which renders the proposed algorithm viable for practical deployment.",Drone,2020
Improving the performance of lightweight CNNs for binary classification using quadratic mutual information regularization,"In this paper, we propose regularized lightweight deep convolutional neural network models, capable of effectively operating in real-time on-drone for high-resolution video input. Furthermore, we study the impact of hinge loss against the cross entropy loss on the classification performance, mainly in binary classification problems. Finally, we propose a novel regularization method motivated by the Quadratic Mutual Information, in order to improve the generalization ability of the utilized models. Extensive experiments on various binary classification problems involved in autonomous systems are performed, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed models. The experimental evaluation on four datasets indicates that hinge loss is the optimal choice for binary classification problems, considering lightweight deep models. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed regularizer in enhancing the generalization ability of the proposed models is also validated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Area-Efficient Vision-Based Feature Tracker for Autonomous Hovering of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"In this paper, we propose a vision-based feature tracker for the autonomous hovering of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and present an area-efficient hardware architecture for its integration into a flight control system-on-chip, which is essential for small UAVs. The proposed feature tracker is based on the Shi-Tomasi algorithm for feature detection and the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade (PLK) algorithm for feature tracking. By applying an efficient hardware structure that leverages the common computations between the Shi-Tomasi and PLK algorithms, the proposed feature tracker offers good tracking performance with fewer hardware resources than existing feature tracker implementations. To evaluate the tracking performance of the proposed feature tracker, we compared it with the GPS-based trajectories of a drone in various flight environments, such as lawn, asphalt, and sidewalk blocks. The proposed tracker exhibited an average accuracy of 0.039 in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE). The proposed feature tracker was designed using the Verilog hardware description language and implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed feature tracker has 2744 slices, 25 DSPs, and 93 Kbit memory and can support the real-time processing at 417 FPS and an operating frequency of 130 MHz for 640 x 480 VGA images.",Drone,2020
FTRM: A Cache-Based Fault Tolerant Recovery Mechanism for Multi-Channel Flash Devices,"Flash memory prevalence has reached greater extents with its performance and compactness capabilities. This enables it to be easily adopted as storage media in various portable devices which includes smart watches, cell-phones, drones, and in-vehicle infotainment systems to mention but a few. To support large flash storage in such portable devices, existing flash translation layers (FTLs) employ a cache mapping table (CMT), which contains a small portion of logical page number to physical page number (LPN-PPN) mappings. For robustness, it is of importance to consider the CMT reconstruction mechanisms during system recovery. Currently, existing approaches cannot overcome the performance penalty after experiencing unexpected power failure. This is due to the disregard of the delay caused by inconsistencies between the cached page-mapping entries in RAM and their corresponding mapping pages in flash storage. Furthermore, how to select proper pages for reconstructing the CMT when rebooting a device needs to be revisited. In this study we address these problems and propose a fault tolerant power-failure recovery mechanism (FTRM) for flash memory storage systems. Our empirical study shows that FTRM is an efficient recovery and robust protocol.",Drone,2020
Variable Pitch Propeller for UAV-Experimental Tests,"Growth in application fields of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and an increase in their total number are followed by higher and higher expectations imposed on improvements in UAV propulsion and energy management systems. Most commercial vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAVs employ a constant pitch propeller that forces a mission execution tradeoff in the majority of cases. An alternative solution, presented here, consists of the use of a variable pitch propeller. The paper summarizes experimental measurements of the propulsion system equipped with an innovative variable pitch rotor. The investigations incorporated characteristics of the rotor for no wind conditions and a new approach to optimize pitch settings in hover flight as a function of UAV weight and energy consumption. As UAV battery capacity is always limited, efficient energy management is the only way to increase UAV mission performance. The study shows that use of a variable pitch propeller can increase the maximal takeoff weight of the aircraft and improve power efficiency in hover, especially if load varies for different missions. The maximal thrust measured was 31% higher with respect to the original blade settings. The coefficient of thrust during hover showed an increase of 2.6% up to 7.5% for various pitch angles with respect to the original fixed propeller.",Drone,2020
Managing the drone revolution: A systematic literature review into the current use of airborne drones and future strategic directions for their effective control,"Commercial and private deployment of airborne drones is revolutionising many ecosystems. To identify critical issues and research gaps, our systematic literature review findings suggest that historic issues such as privacy, acceptance and security are increasingly replaced by operational considerations including interaction with and impacts on other airspace users. Recent incidents show that unrestricted drone use can inflict problems on other airspace users like airports and emergency services. Our review of current regulatory approaches shows a need for further policy and management response to both manage rapid and efficient drone usage growth, and facilitate innovation (e.g. intraurban package delivery), with one promising strategic response being low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems for all drone use cases.",Drone,2020
Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of Radar Micro-Doppler Signature Modulated by Rotating Blades of Drones,"Radar signatures contributed by rotating blades of drones usually refer to the kinematical micro-Doppler phenomenon on spectrograms. Here, theoretical analysis indicates that when sampling time is short enough that this signature becomes instant micro-Doppler signatures with scattering characteristics, appearing as ""blade flash"" in the time domain and rotor blade modulation (RBM) feature in the spectrum. In an anechoic chamber, we track this instant micro-Doppler signature by using a dynamic measurement system composed of a network analyzer and a high-speed camera to collect high-resolution range profile of a consumer drone, DJI Phantom 3 Vision within S-band, X-band, and Ku-band. The experimental results demonstrate that rotating blades do cause signal fluctuation of ""blade flash"" and register the RBM feature in the spectrum, and the modulation effects are weak within S-band, strong within X-band, and stronger within Ku-band. This instant micro-Doppler with scattering characteristic establishes a mapping between radar signature and the rotation structure component of the drone and enables us to distinguish a drone from other nonblades objects in the air, especially with little radar observation time.",Drone,2020
Teach-Repeat-Replan: A Complete and Robust System for Aggressive Flight in Complex Environments,"In this article, we propose a complete and robust system for the aggressive flight of autonomous quadrotors. The proposed system is built upon on the classical teach-and-repeat framework, which is widely adopted in infrastructure inspection, aerial transportation, and search-and-rescue. For these applications, a human's intention is essential for deciding the topological structure of the flight trajectory of the drone. However, poor teaching trajectories and changing environments prevent a simple teach-and-repeat system from being applied flexibly and robustly. In this article, instead of commanding the drone to precisely follow a teaching trajectory, we propose a method to automatically convert a human-piloted trajectory, which can be arbitrarily jerky, to a topologically equivalent one. The generated trajectory is guaranteed to be smooth, safe, and dynamically feasible, with a human preferable aggressiveness. Also, to avoid unmapped or moving obstacles during flights, a fast local perception method and a sliding-windowed replanning method are integrated into our system, to generate safe and dynamically feasible local trajectories onboard. We name our system as teach-repeat-replan. It can capture users' intention of a flight mission, convert an arbitrarily jerky teaching path to a smooth repeating trajectory, and generate safe local replans to avoid unexpected collisions. The proposed planning system is integrated into a complete autonomous quadrotor with global and local perception and localization submodules. Our system is validated by performing aggressive flights in challenging indoor/outdoor environments. We release all components in our quadrotor system as open-source ros packages.",Drone,2020
General-Purpose Object-Oriented Framework for Vorticity-Dominated Flow Simulation,"This paper describes the development of a computational framework for aerodynamic simulations based on the unsteady vortex lattice method under the object-oriented programming paradigm. The effort aims to fulfill the fluid-dynamics portion of the fluid-structure interaction problem in the multiphysics field. The construction and implementation of an object-oriented model is introduced along with its analysis and design stages, focusing on the generality and versatility. The overall class organization is presented, and the main classes' characteristics are discussed. The software validation indicates that the transient and the steady-state aerodynamics for the impulsively started motion of a body are accurately captured by the simulations. In addition, comparisons against experimental results show that rotors in hover flight are acceptably represented for small angles of attack of the blades, within the limitations of the flat-plate representation and the inviscid hypothesis of the model. Regarding applications, six different models are analyzed: 1) a single propeller rotor, 2) a small-scale quadcopter drone, 3) a flying-wing drone, 4) a joined-wing aircraft, 5) a drag-reduction system for cars, and, 6) a flapping-wing insect. In all cases, the results indicate that a well-tuned simulation based on vorticity-dominated flows is widely suitable for the aerodynamic study of several cases. All simulations expose the main advantages of a modular object-oriented program: the ability to change the case of analysis with minimal reprogramming, and the flexibility to link with different models in a co-simulation strategy.",Drone,2020
TiltDrone: A Fully-Actuated Tilting Quadrotor Platform,"Multi-directional aerial platforms can fly in almost any orientation and direction, often maneuvering in ways their underactuated counterparts cannot match. A subset of multi-directional platforms is fully-actuated multirotors, where all six degrees of freedom are independently controlled without redundancies. Fully-actuated multirotors possess much greater freedom of movement than conventional multirotor drones, allowing them to perform complex sensing and manipulation tasks. While there has been comprehensive research on multi-directional multirotor control systems, the spectrum of hardware designs remains fragmented. This letter sets out the hardware design architecture of a fully-actuated quadrotor and its associated control framework. Following the novel platform design, a prototype was built to validate the control scheme and characterize the flight performance. The resulting quadrotor was shown in operation to be capable of holding a stationary hover at 30 degrees incline, and track position commands by thrust vectoring [Video attachment: https://youtu.be/8HOQl_77CVg].",Drone,2020
AOA-based drone localization using wireless sensor-doublets,"In this paper, we introduce a method to estimate the drone location in a wireless sensor field (SF). The sensors are assumed to be installed in a field in a doublets form (i.e., each two sensors are combined to form a doublet). Each doublet in the near drone location can be used to estimate the angle between the doublet axis and the line connecting the drone to doublet's vertex. The locus of this angle will form a cone. Using six sets of different doublets, one can locate the drone by considering the intersection of the corresponding six cones. Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is derived for the proposed estimator. Also, simulation results are provided to illustrate the estimator's performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Coverage Optimization with a Dynamic Network of Drone Relays,"The integration of aerial base stations carried by drones in cellular networks offers promising opportunities to enhance the connectivity enjoyed by ground users. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the 3-D placement and repositioning of a fleet of drones with a realistic inter-drone interference model and drone connectivity constraints. We show how to maximize network coverage by means of an extremal-optimization algorithm. The design of our algorithm is based on a mixed-integer non-convex program formulation for a coverage problem that is NP-Complete, as we prove in the paper. We not only optimize drone positions in a 3-D space in polynomial time, but also assign flight routes solving an assignment problem and using a strong geometrical tool, namely Bezier curves, which are extremely useful for non-uniform and realistic topologies. Specifically, we propose to fly drones following Bezier curves to seek the chance of approaching to clusters of ground users. This enhances coverage over time while users and drones move. We assess the performance of our proposal for synthetic scenarios as well as realistic maps extracted from the topology of a capital city. We demonstrate that our framework is near-optimal and using Bezier curves increases coverage up to 47 percent while drones move.",Drone,2020
MEMS triaxial gyroscope using surface and sidewall doping piezoresistors,"This paper describes a MEMS triaxial gyroscope utilizing three-dimensional piezoresistive elements. MEMS gyroscopes are widely used for robot motion control, drones, mobile phones and so on. Although a piezoresistive sensing element has the potential for high sensitivity to angular velocity via vibrations that occur due to the Coriolis force, a commonly used piezoresistor, which is formed on a device surface, is not suitable to measure in-plane deformations. Thus, it is difficult to realize a sensing element for a triaxial gyroscope with conventional piezoresistors, especially an element for the detection of vertical axis angular velocity. Here, we propose a triaxial gyroscope utilizing surface and sidewall doping piezoresistors as the sensing element. The surface and sidewall doping piezoresistors detect out-of-plane and in-plane vibrations due to the corresponding three-dimensional Coriolis forces, respectively. As a result, the triaxial angular velocity becomes measurable. The experimental results show that the fabricated gyroscope responds to three-dimensional angular velocities with low crosstalk. Therefore, the proposed gyroscope is suitable for practical angular velocity measurement applications.",Drone,2020
Safe and optimal navigation for autonomous multi-rotor aerial vehicle in a dynamic known environment by a decomposition-coordination method,"In this paper, we present a new solution for the Autonomous navigation problem, using a Decomposition-Coordination Method (DCM) 1. The main purpose of this work is to compute an optimal and safe path for the multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a dynamic environment, moving from an initial location to the desired state. We assume that the flight environment is totally known to a supervisory unit, and the positions and trajectories of dynamic obstacles could be known in real-time, thus to perform in such environment a high reactivity is required as well as good connectivity with the supervisory unit that provides the safe path, each time one obstacle or more are detected on the road, so that the UAV could autonomously diverts from the unsafe path to the new safe one, and avoid the potential collisions. First and foremost, we choose a generalized nonlinear model for the multi-rotors in view of the rotational and translational dynamics of the UAV. We then associate that model with the objective functions. After that, we proceed to the resolution of the multi-objective optimization problem using our approach of decomposition-coordination. The principle of this method consists in decomposing the system into several smaller subsystems to simplify the treatment. Then we achieve the coordination afterward using Lagrange multipliers. To prove the convergence and stability of our method we make use of a Lyapunov function chosen particularly for this system. In the last section we present the simulation results, to confirm the reliability of our method. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Drone,2020
Acoustic Source Localization From Multirotor UAVs,"In this article, we address the problem of acoustic source localization using a microphone array mounted on multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Conventional localization beamforming techniques are especially challenging in these specific conditions, due to the nature and intensity of the disturbances affecting the recorded acoustic signals. The principal disturbances are related to the high-frequency, narrowband noise originated by the electrical engines, and to the broadband aerodynamic noise induced by the propellers. A solution to this problem is proposed, which adopts an efficient beamforming technique for the direction of arrival estimation of an acoustic source and a circular array detached from the multirotor vehicle body in order to reduce the effects of noise generated by the propellers. The approach used to localize the source relies on a diagonal unloading beamforming with a novel norm transform frequency fusion. The proposed algorithm is tested on a multirotor UAV equipped with a compact uniform circular array of eight microphones, placed on the bottom of the drone to localize the target acoustic source placed on the ground while the quadcopter is hovering at different altitudes. The experimental results conducted in outdoor hovering conditions are illustrated, and the localization performances are reported under various recording conditions and source characteristics.",Drone,2020
Path Following Control of Quadrotor UAV With Continuous Fractional-Order Super Twisting Sliding Mode,"Quadrotors are highly maneuverable drones, which are susceptible to the parameter uncertainties such as the mass, drag coefficients, and moment of inertia. Whose nonlinearities, aerodynamic disturbances, and higher coupling between the rotational and the translational dynamics stand for a problem that demands a robust controller. In the present paper, a fractional order (FO) improved super twisting proportional-integral-derivative sliding-mode control (STPIDSMC) is proposed for the quadrotor system. To improve the speed tracking performance, a FOPIDSM surface is designed. Moreover, the proposed FO control approach ensures fast convergence, high precision, good robustness against stochastic perturbations and uncertainties. Finally, the performance of the FOSTPIDSMC is investigated under different scenarios. The simulation results clearly show the high control performance, efficiency and high disturbance rejection capacity of the controller strategy proposed in this work in comparison with the nonlinear internal model control (NLIMC) and FO backstepping sliding mode control (FOBSMC) strategies.",Drone,2020
The promising future of drones in prehospital medical care and its application to battlefield medicine,"Unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly referred to as drones, have been made widely available in recent years leading to an exponential growth in their roles and applications. The rapidly developing field of medical drones is on the verge of revolutionizing prehospital medicine enabling advanced health care delivery to once-inaccessible patients. The aim of this review is to clarify the basic technical properties of currently available medical drones and review recent advances and their usefulness in military and civilian health care missions. A thorough search was conducted using conventional medical literature databases and nonmedical popular search engines. The results indicate increasingly rapid incorporation of unmanned aerial vehicles into search and rescue missions, telemedicine assignments, medical supply routes, public health surveillance, and disaster management. Medical drones appear to be of great benefit for improving survivability of deployed forces on and off the battlefield. The emerging aerial medical delivery systems appear to provide particularly promising solutions for bridging some of the many serious gaps between third world health care systems and their western counterparts and between major metropolitan centers and distant rural communities. The global nature of drone-based health care delivery needs points to a need for an international effort between collaborating civilian and military medical forces to harness the currently available resources and novel emerging technologies for broader lifesaving capabilities.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Level V.",Drone,2019
Stability of Cloud-Based UAV Systems Supporting Big Data Acquisition and Processing,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has been widely applied in both military and civilian applications. Recent researches on UAV systems feature in the dramatic augment of the variety and number of equipped sensors, which results in such an issue that multiple UAVs cannot afford to handle the big data generated by a range of sensors in the air. Considering this practical problem, in this paper, we propose a cloud-based UAV system which incorporates the computing capability of the terrestrial cloud into the UAV systems. Relying on proposed cloud-based UAV system, one critical theoretic issue is how to acquire the big data generated by the sensors while guaranteeing a stable operation state of the system. First, we analyze the cloud-based system's on-demand service ability as well as its impact on UAVs' control procedure. Second, the UAV cloud control system is modeled as a network control system. Moreover, the stable condition of the UAV cloud control system is derived, which reveals the relationship between the acquisition rate of sensor data and the stability of the cloud-based UAV system. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our theoretical analysis.",Drone,2019
SwarmTouch: Guiding a Swarm of Micro-Quadrotors With Impedance Control Using a Wearable Tactile Interface,"To achieve a smooth and safe guiding of a drone formation by a human operator, we propose a novel interaction strategy for a human-swarm communication, which combines impedance control and vibrotactile feedback. The presented approach takes into account the human hand velocity and changes the formation shape and dynamics accordingly using impedance interlinks simulated between quadrotors, which helps to achieve a natural swarm behavior. Several tactile patterns representing static and dynamic parameters of the swarm are proposed. The user feels the state of the swarm at the fingertips and receives valuable information to improve the controllability of the complex formation. A user study revealed the patterns with high recognition rates. A flight experiment demonstrated the possibility to accurately navigate the formation in a cluttered environment using only tactile feedback. Subjects stated that tactile sensation allows guiding the drone formation through obstacles and makes the human-swarm communication more interactive. The proposed technology can potentially have a strong impact on the human-swarm interaction, providing a higher level of awareness during the swarm navigation.",Drone,2019
"Aerial-Underwater Systems, a New Paradigm in Unmanned Vehicles","Unmanned Aerial-Underwater Vehicles (UAUVs) arise as a new kind of unmanned system capable of performing equally well in multiple mediums and seamlessly transitioning between them. This work focuses in the modeling and trajectory tracking control of a special class of air-underwater vehicle with full torque actuation and a single thrust force directed along the vehicle's vertical axis. In particular, a singularity-free representation is required in order to orient the vehicle in any direction, which becomes critical underwater in order to direct the thrust force in the direction of motion and effectively overcome the increased drag and buoyancy forces. A quaternion based representation is used for this purpose. A hierarchical controller is proposed, where trajectory tracking is accomplished by a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller with compensation of the restoring forces. The outer trajectory tracking control loop provides the thrust force and desired orientation. The latter is fed to the inner attitude control loop, where a nonlinear quaternion feedback is employed. A gain scheduling strategy is used to deal with the drastic change in medium density during transitions. The proposed scheme is studied through numerical simulations, while real time experiments validate the good performance of the system.",Drone,2019
Predictive geographic multicast routing protocol in flying ad hoc networks,"In the past decades, the unmanned aerial systems have been utilized only for military operations. However, recently, the potential uses and applicability of unmanned aerial vehicles (commonly known as drones) in civilian application domains are becoming a fast-growing phenomenon. A flying ad hoc network is a wireless ad hoc network specifically designed for the communication of unmanned aerial vehicles. Multicast routing is one of the vital aspects in wireless ad hoc networks. Using multicast transmission approaches, flying ad hoc network applications may need to send the same message to a specific group of flying nodes. The multicast communication approaches can benefit flying ad hoc network applications in conserving the scarce resources of flying nodes. Research works have been proposed to tackle the challenges in multicast routing with multi-hop communication in ad hoc network environments. Nevertheless, the conventional multicast routing mechanisms incur excessive control message overhead when a large number of nodes experience frequent topological changes. A scalable geographic multicast routing mechanism, which specially require localized operation and reduced control packet overhead, is necessary. Multicast routing in flying ad hoc networks is extremely challenging because of the dynamic topology changes and network disconnection resulted from frequent mobility of nodes. In this article, we present and implement a scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc networks. In uniform and random deployment scenarios, the MATLAB-based evaluation result has revealed that when the communication range increases, the probability of finding one-hop predicted forwarders to reach multicast destinations also increases. The implementation of scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc network is done using Optimizing Network Engineering Tools Modeler 16.0. We have added the scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc network as a new routing scheme in the Mobile Ad hoc Network routing protocol groups of the Optimizing Network Engineering Tools Modeler. Then, the performance of scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc network is compared with two of the existing Mobile Ad hoc Network routing protocols (Geographic Routing Protocol and Dynamic Source Routing). Eventually, we present two instance scenarios regarding the integration of scalable and predictive geographic multicast routing mechanism in flying ad hoc network scheme in the Internet of Things platform.",Drone,2019
Application specific drone simulators: Recent advances and challenges,"Over the past two decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, have gained a lot of attention, and are rapidly becoming ubiquitous because of their diverse applications such as surveillance, disaster management, pollution monitoring, film-making, and military reconnaissance. However, incidents such as fatal system failures, malicious attacks, and disastrous misuses have raised concerns in the recent past. Security and viability concerns in drone-based applications are growing at an alarming rate. Besides, UAV networks (UAVNets) are distinctive from other ad-hoc networks. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues to ensure proper functioning of these UAVs while keeping their uniqueness in mind. Furthermore, adequate security and functionality require the consideration of many parameters that may include an accurate cognizance of the working mechanism of vehicles, geographical and weather conditions, and UAVNet communication. This is achievable by creating a simulator that includes these aspects. A performance evaluation through relevant drone simulator becomes indispensable procedure to test features, configurations, and designs to demonstrate superiority to comparative schemes and suitability. Thus, it becomes of paramount importance to establish the credibility of simulation results by investigating the merits and limitations of each simulator prior to selection. Based on this motivation, we present a comprehensive survey of current drone simulators. In addition, open research issues and research challenges are discussed and presented.",Drone,2019
Design and Experimental Demonstration of Coaxially Folded All-reflective Imaging System,"With slimmer, lighter and all-reflective imaging systems in high demand for consumer and military applications, coaxially folded optical image systems are widely considered because they can extend focal length and reduce track length.

Simulating unmanned aerial vehicle flight control and collision detection.,"An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a small, fast aircraft with many useful features. It is widely used in military reconnaissance, aerial photography, searches, and other fields; it also has very good practical-application and development prospects. Since the UAV's flight orientation is easily changeable, its orientation and flight path are difficult to control, leading to its high damage rate. Therefore, UAV flight-control technology has become the focus of attention. This study focuses on simulating a UAV's flight and orientation control, and detecting collisions between a UAV and objects in a complex virtual environment. The proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm is used to control the orientation and position of the UAV in a virtual environment.

Trajectory Optimization in a Cooperative Aerial Reconnaissance Model,"In recent years, the use of modern technology in military operations has become standard practice. Unmanned systems play an important role in operations such as reconnaissance and surveillance. This article examines a model for planning aerial reconnaissance using a fleet of mutually cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles to increase the effectiveness of the task. The model deploys a number of waypoints such that, when every waypoint is visited by any vehicle in the fleet, the area of interest is fully explored. The deployment of waypoints must meet the conditions arising from the technical parameters of the sensory systems used and tactical requirements of the task at hand. This paper proposes an improvement of the model by optimizing the number and position of waypoints deployed in the area of interest, the effect of which is to improve the trajectories of individual unmanned systems, and thus increase the efficiency of the operation. To achieve this optimization, a modified simulated annealing algorithm is proposed. The improvement of the model is verified by several experiments. Two sets of benchmark problems were designed: (a) benchmark problems for verifying the proposed algorithm for optimizing waypoints, and (b) benchmark problems based on typical reconnaissance scenarios in the real environment to prove the increased effectiveness of the reconnaissance operation. Moreover, an experiment in the SteelBeast simulation system was also conducted.",Drone,2019
Wavelet transform based modulation classification for 5G and UAV communication in multipath fading channel,"Nowadays, fifth generation (5G) network and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) are more and more important in the civil and military field. Only communicating correctly in 5G network and between UAVs, they can play a role in real world. Modulation classification is the premise to ensure communication in 5G network and between UAVs correctly. However, the effects of multipath fading always exists in the 5G communication environment and UAV communication channel, which leads to severe modulation classification performance and communication performance degradation. In order to resolve this problem, we proposed a novel modulation classification algorithm that can classify signals without priori information in multipath channel. The proposed algorithm makes the mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis of wavelet transform as the feature set, then uses principal component analysis (PCA) for feature subset selection, in the end neural network is used as classifier to classify signals. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the much better classification accuracy than the existing methods in multipath fading channels. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Innovation-Technological Breakthroughs: Influence on the Arms Control,"In the context of intensive innovation-digital developments for the provision of the deterrence in the interests of international security and strategic stability, the registration of technological factors of the defense systems development takes on greater and greater importance. Important aspects of the evolving or, better to say, ""digital-technological"" race, which influence strategic stability, may have a profound effect on the character, model, scales, instruments of arms deterrence, and on the perspectives of the arms control system as a whole. The main hypothesis of the work is as follows. High dynamics of the innovation-digital development is one of the key factors which determine the inevitability of the appearance of a new conceptual approach to the arms control and new forms of deterrence. The last, for an example, may be called a hybrid deterrence, including asymmetric threats deterrence, cyber deterrence, deterrence in space and deterrence by denial. The necessity to consider revolutionary and incremental innovations as important elements of national military power and international security is noted. Special attention is given to the perspectives of development and use of Big Data, automation, quantum computers, artificial intelligence, including such transforming, so-called ""traditional"" (incremental) technologies as hypersonic vehicles (for example). Interactions and integrations of the revolutionary and evolutional technologies in their influence on strategic stability and different sorts of arms deterrence are on the rise. It is suggested that such circumstances, with increasing complexity and a systemic character of the strategic deterrence environment, may lead to formation of the united universal arms deterrence in the future. The main characters of this universal system would be the eroding borders between different deterrence types and transfer of tasks between them: for instance, between nuclear and conventional weapons.",Drone,2019
A Hierarchical Mission Planning Method for Simultaneous Arrival of Multi-UAV Coalition,"Featured ApplicationCooperative task allocation and path planning problems of multi-UAV are becoming more and more important. The proposed mission planning method can be easily applied to some civilian scenarios, such as multi-UAV cooperative forest fire fighting and some military scenarios.Abstract A hierarchical mission planning method was proposed to solve a simultaneous attack mission planning problem for multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The method consisted of three phases aiming to decouple and solve the mission planning problem. In the first phase, the Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curve was used in the path estimation process for each UAV, which also served as the input for the task allocation process. In the second phase, a task allocation algorithm based on a negotiation mechanism was proposed to assign the targets. Considering the resource requirement, time-dependent value of targets and resource consumption of UAVs, the proposed task allocation algorithm can generate a feasible allocation strategy and get the maximum system utility. In the last phase, a path planning method was proposed to generate a simultaneous arrival PH path for each UAV considering UAV's kinematic constraint and collision avoidance with obstacles. The comparison simulations showed that the path estimation process using the PH curve and the proposed task allocation algorithm improved the system utility, and the hierarchical mission planning method has potential in a real mission.",Drone,2019
Multi-base multi-UAV cooperative reconnaissance path planning with genetic algorithm,"Describing cooperative reconnaissance is crucial for air traffic relating to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) loaded in different bases in an increasingly complex battlefield environment. Compared with the traditional problem that all UAVs took off from just one base, this paper is to address reconnaissance missions, which must be done in partnership among multiple UAVs in different bases. To improve missions' reliability, residence time in effective detection of enemy radars should be mitigated under the premise of missions completed by UAVs. This paper transforms the minimum residence time into the shortest path combinatorial optimization, and discretizes heading angles. Graph theory is applied to analyze path problems and a global model with numerous constraint conditions can be built. Finally, a valuable reconnaissance path planning can be generated through solving the model with genetic algorithm. Also an application example that eight UAVs in four bases finish reconnaissance missions involving sixty-eight targets is established, and then an optimal solution is got to explain both the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed modularization and algorithm.",Drone,2019
Recent Progress of Marine Survey Unmanned Surface Vehicle in China,"Based on the ongoing techniques among control theory, communication networks, and sensor design, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned undersea vehicles (UUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are experiencing rapid development. Research on these unmanned systems and those intelligent sectors inside has absorbed interests and investments from not only military but also civil organizations. The well-applied fields include surveillance and reconnaissance, surface warfare, antisubmarine warfare, mine countermeasures, oceanic environment monitoring, search and rescue, hydrographic survey, and so on. Comparing with those studies on UAVs and UUVs, the one focusing on USVs was started later and has been developed quickly in the past 20 years. Since 2013, USV has advanced considerably in China, particularly in the marine survey field. Owing to its characteristics of light-weighting, intelligence, and unmanned operations, USV is attractive for shallow water, extreme environments, and marine accidents.

Resilience evaluation for UAV swarm performing joint reconnaissance mission,"The resilience of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is its joint capability to resist possible threat, adapt to disruptive events, and restore its intended performance under a specific time period. The quantitative assessment of the UAV swarm resilience requires a thorough understanding of its missions. In this paper, a mission-oriented framework is proposed to implement the resilience evaluation for the UAV swarm. Guided by the framework, the resilience evaluation for the UAV swarm performing joint reconnaissance mission is studied. A UAV swarm model is developed for joint reconnaissance mission based on complex networks and agent-based models. The following aspects of the UAV swarm are considered in the proposed model, namely, the mission orientation, UAV attributes, swarm topology, UAV cooperative strategy, UAV information exchange and fusion strategy, potential threats, recovery strategies, etc. Then, a novel performance metric is proposed to measure the mission capability of the UAV swarm performing joint reconnaissance mission. Results from the simulations show that, compared with existing studies, the proposed approach can provide more realistic and objective resilience evaluation for the mission-oriented UAV swarm. The above works can be used to support the decision making and the optimal design of the UAV swarm, given different missions.",Drone,2019
Secrecy-Aware Altitude Optimization for Quasi-Static UAV Base Station Without Eavesdropper Location Information,"In this letter, the altitude of an unmanned aerial vehicle base station (UAV-BS) is optimized to maximize an average worst case secrecy rate (AWSR) without eavesdropper location information. The air-to-ground channels are modeled based on the derived line-of-sight probability under a general urban model with Poisson point process and Rayleigh distribution for the locations and heights of the buildings, respectively. To solve the AWSR maximization problem, which is intractable, we reformulate it by the first-order Taylor series approximation and apply the Davies-Swann-Campey algorithm to effectively find the solution of the modified AWSR maximization problem. Numerical results verify that the altitude of UAV-BS affects the secrecy rate significantly and that the proposed UAV-BS can improve the secrecy rate compared with a static terrestrial BS.",Drone,2019
Three-dimensional discrete-time controller to intercept a targeted UAV using a capture net towed by multiple aerial robots,This study considers a team of aerial robots towing the boundary of a capture net so that the net intercepts a fast unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with variable velocity. The robot team tows the net boundary so that the net captures the targeted UAV as fast as possible. The centre of the net is controlled so that the net centre moves while not rotating the line-of-sight connecting the pair (the net centre and the UAV). MATLAB simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the authors' approach.,Drone,2019
Investigation and realisation of integrated navigation system using optimal pseudo sensor enhancement method,"The rapid development of intelligent navigation systems has speed development for its uses in military and civilian applications. On-board integrated navigation and multiple sensors are essential for real-time data update. Using multiple sensors may sever from the disconnection of the readings due to sensor(s) transient faults. So, the need for sensor(s) transient fault correction becomes an important action to improve performance. In this study, a novel proposed optimal pseudo sensor enhancement method (OPSEM) is introduced, investigated and implemented. The proposed OPSEM has multiple missions: (i) optimal arrangement for the sensors architecture, (ii) detecting, isolating, and compensating for the sensor(s) transient fault. The simulation results of the traditional and the proposed OPSEMs for multiple sensor architecture have been obtained, analysed and compared. Also, the proposed OPSEM has been applied to the proportional navigation guidance law to check for the improved performance. Finally, the integrated OPSEM navigation system has been realised and implemented. The proposed OPSEM practical system has been examined using unmanned aerial vehicle and fixed wing aircrafts to illustrate the improved operation of the proposed OPSEM system.",Drone,2019
Effects of Correlated Multivariate FSO Channel on Outage Performance of Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN),"In order to share the global information and resources efficiently over a huge network topology, the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) system integrates a number of networks for optimal utilization. Nonetheless, the related communication units between the mobile platforms and air-to-ground links are constrained to a low-bit rate radio-based technology. In addition, the required services to be supported demand a high capacity link. This will ensure effective management of multiple information in parallel and in real-time. One of attractive systems with inherent features to support the network demands is the free-space optical (FSO) communication system. Nevertheless, drift support in the SAGIN could be challenging for the FSO system. This is due to the required line-of-sight link alignment between the receiver and transmitter modules. Besides, FSO system is susceptible to the atmospheric turbulence-induced fading. This can be addressed by operating unmanned aerial vehicles in the SAGIN system in swarm mode. Conversely, this can bring about channel correlation eventually resulting into system performance impairments. This paper considers the effect of correlated FSO channel on the SAGIN system outage performance. To accomplish this, we consider exponential model for modeling the correlations between the apertures. Moreover, to account for the spatial correlation for different diversity orders in the air-to-ground as well as air-to-air communications, we employ a multivariate Gamma-Gamma () distribution. The results of the analysis appropriately quantify the effects of the atmospheric turbulence-induced fading as well as correlation on the system outage performance.",Drone,2019
A vehicle routing problem arising in unmanned aerial monitoring,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to perform monitoring tasks both in the military and civilian areas, and the planning of their routes is critical. This study investigates a routing problem in which UAVs monitor a set of areas with different accuracy requirements. This problem is a variant of the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP), where one must determine not only the order in which to visit a set of nodes located in the plane, but also the height at which to visit them, which impacts the accuracy level and the service time. An integer programming model is formulated to optimize flight routes and minimize the total time needed to complete the monitoring tasks. A tabu search metaheuristic is developed for the problem. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to assess the efficiency of the heuristic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Convolutional neural network target detection in hyperspectral imaging for maritime surveillance,"This work addresses a hyperspectral imaging system for maritime surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles. The objective was to detect the presence of vessels using purely spatial and spectral hyperspectral information. To accomplish this objective, we implemented a novel 3-D convolutional neural network approach and compared against two implementations of other state-of-the-art methods: spectral angle mapper and hyperspectral derivative anomaly detection. The hyperspectral imaging system was developed during the SUNNY project, and the methods were tested using data collected during the project final demonstration, in Sao Jacinto Air Force Base, Aveiro (Portugal). The obtained results show that a 3-D CNN is able to improve the recall value, depending on the class, by an interval between 27% minimum, to a maximum of over 40%, when compared to spectral angle mapper and hyperspectral derivative anomaly detection approaches. Proving that 3-D CNN deep learning techniques that combine spectral and spatial information can be used to improve the detection of targets classification accuracy in hyperspectral imaging unmanned aerial vehicles maritime surveillance applications.",Drone,2019
Bistatic antenna configurations for air-launched ground penetrating radar,"Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is valuable for the detection of subsurface objects with little or no metal content, such as plastics, ceramics, and concrete piping. However, the effects of antenna configuration parameters, such as height and angle, are not well studied for all sensing applications. GPR simulations and laboratory GPR experiments are performed to evaluate the effects of antenna angle and height on the sensitivity of bistatic air-launched GPR, to search for buried nonmetallic objects. The results presented provide guidance for the development of air-launched GPR systems installed on unmanned aerial vehicles for in-flight subsurface scanning of buried targets.

Direct trajectory optimization framework for vertical takeoff and vertical landing reusable rockets: case study of two-stage rockets,"This study presents a direct trajectory optimization framework for a vertical takeoff and vertical landing (VTVL) reusable rocket with a two-stage structure for a launch mission to simultaneously deliver a payload to the desired orbit and recover the rocket. A two-phase trajectory optimization problem of VTVL reusable rockets is established, with the main features of the flight process. The finite-element collocation approach with Radau collocation is utilized to transcribe the established problem into a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem solved by Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT). Novel internal-external-growth initialization strategies are designed to enhance the convergence of solving the NLP problem. The proposed direct trajectory optimization framework is applied to two representative scenarios of VTVL reusable rockets: return to a launch site and return to a drone ship. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed trajectory optimization framework has the adaptability to deal effectively with the complex missions of VTVL reusable rockets.",Drone,2019
Battlefield situation awareness and networking based on agent distributed computing,"The battlefield environment is complex and changeable, and there are complex terrain features and bad electromagnetic communication environment. At the present stage, the battlefield reconnaissance and communication network mainly depends on the cooperation of soldiers. With the development of unmanned aerial vehicle and pilotless technology, in the background of information warfare, the use of mobile agents to complete the formation of battlefield communication networks and the battlefield situation awareness has become a new trend. The Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology is becoming more and more mature, and its distribution, synergy, parallelism, robustness and intelligence provide the basic conditions for the construction of a battlefield self organizing network. In this paper, we use UAVs and unmanned combat vehicles to build a mobile ad hoc network that meets the conditions of the battlefield. The network can solve the problem of slow convergence or non convergence of the traditional self-organizing network without relying on the fixed basic network facilities, which has the characteristics of rapid expansion, strong destruction resistance and no centrality. So it can meet the needs of communication in the battlefield. In this process, we combine the A star algorithm with the ant colony algorithm to realize the real-time path planning in combination with the edge computing power of the agent and the battlefield situation collected by the sensor, and the battlefield aggregation and search task can be completed quickly. And according to the planned route, the route forwarding strategy under known path is used to complete the information transmission. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Flight test of flying-wing type unmanned aerial vehicle with partial wing-loss,"This paper investigates experimental evaluation via flight tests for applying adaptive neural network controller to a flying-wing type unmanned aerial vehicle experiencing partial wing-loss. For this, six-degree-of-freedom numerical model is constructed taking into account damage-induced changes to the unmanned aerial vehicle in aerodynamic coefficients, mass, center of gravity, and moments of inertia. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the flight dynamics change and to verify the performance of the neural network based controller. During the flight test, main wing-loss is artificially generated by 22% or 33% area moment. The flight test verifies that the damaged unmanned aerial vehicle shows drastic roll behavior with the unstable longitudinal response, and the neural network based adaptive controller combined with feedback linearization successfully compensates for the wing damage.",Drone,2019
Affine formation maneuver tracking control of multiple second-order agents with time-varying delays,"This paper considers an affine maneuver tracking control problem for leader-follower type second-order multi-agent systems in the presence of time-varying delays, where the interaction topology is directed. Using the property of the affine transformation, this paper gives the sufficient and necessary conditions of achieving the affine localizability and extends it to the second-order condition. Under the (n + 1)-reachable condition of the given n-dimensional nominal formation with n + 1 leaders, a formation of agents can be reshaped in arbitrary dimension by only controlling these leaders. When the neighboring positions and velocities are available, a formation maneuver tracking control protocol with time-varying delays is constructed with the form of linear systems, where the tracking errors of the followers can be specified. Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, sufficient conditions to realize affine maneuvers are proposed and proved, and the unknown control gain matrix can be solved only by four linear matrix inequalities independent of the number of agents. Finally, corresponding simulations are carried out to verify the theoretical results, which show that these followers can track the time-varying references accurately and continuously.",Drone,2019
CFD Analysis of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Moving in Flocks,"In recent years, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has increased rapidly. These vehicles have instant detection, tracking and destruction capabilities in military operations. In addition, when compared other conventional aerial vehicles, in the case of the vehicles down, any loss of driver life can be accounted for the most important factor in the view of widespread use of this vehicle. It is very important to make aerodynamic analyzes of unmanned aerial vehicles swarming behavior and to identify reliable zones for vehicles. It should be determined at what speeds and closeness of the flying vehicles along the specified routes the vehicles should be located within the frame. In this study, the models of an unmanned aerial vehicle and propellers of an UAV were designed with computational fluid dynamics. Especially turbulence, pressure, and speed changes have been investigated. Moreover, the range of interaction distance that they can create on each other is determined and reliable regions are determined.",Drone,2019
MAV/UAV task coalition phased-formation method,"The formation of the manned aerial vehicle/unmanned aerial vehicle (MAV/UAV) task coalition is considered. To reduce the scale of the problem, the formation progress is divided into three phases. For the task clustering phase, the geographical position of tasks is taken into consideration and a cluster method is proposed. For the UAV allocation phase, the UAV requirement for both constrained and unconstrained resources is introduced, and a multi-objective optimal algorithm is proposed to solve the allocation problem. For the MAV allocation phase, the optimal model is firstly constructed and it is decomposed according to the ideal of greed to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. Based on the above phases, the MAV/UAV task coalition formation method is proposed and the effectiveness and practicability are demonstrated by simulation examples.",Drone,2019
Formation Generation for Multiple Unmanned Vehicles Using Multi-Agent Hybrid Social Cognitive Optimization Based on the Internet of Things,"Multi-agent hybrid social cognitive optimization (MAHSCO) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is suggested to solve the problem of the generation of formations of unmanned vehicles. Through the analysis of the unmanned vehicle formation problem, formation principles, formation scale, unmanned vehicle formation safety distance, and formation evaluation indicators are taken into consideration. The application of the IoT enables the optimization of distributed computing. To ensure the reliability of the formation algorithm, the convergence of MAHSCO has been proved. Finally, computer simulation and actual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation generation flight generating four typical formations are carried out. The result of the actual UAV formation generation flight is consistent with the simulation experiment, and the algorithm performs well. The MAHSCO algorithm based on the IoT is proved to be able to generate formations that meet the mission requirements quickly and accurately.",Drone,2019
Joint UAV Hovering Altitude and Power Control for Space-Air-Ground IoT Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in both military and civilian applications. Equipped with diverse communication payloads, UAVs cooperating with satellites and base stations constitute a space-air-ground three-tier heterogeneous network, which are beneficial in terms of both providing the seamless coverage as well as of improving the capacity for increasingly prosperous Internet of Things networks. However, cross-tier interference may be inevitable among these tightly embraced heterogeneous networks when sharing the same spectrum. The power association problem in satellite, UAV and macrocell three-tier networks becomes a critical issue. In this paper, we propose a two-stage joint hovering altitude and power control solution for the resource allocation problem in UAV networks considering the inevitable cross-tier interference from space-air-ground heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, Lagrange dual decomposition and concave-convex procedure method are used to solve this problem, followed by a low-complexity greedy search algorithm. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed two-stage joint optimization algorithm in terms of UAV network's total throughput.",Drone,2019
Design and Analysis of Secure Lightweight Remote User Authentication and Key Agreement Scheme in Internet of Drones Deployment,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) provides a coordinated access to unmanned aerial vehicles that are referred as drones. The on-going miniaturization of sensors, actuators, and processors with ubiquitous wireless connectivity makes drones to be used in a wide range of applications ranging from military to civilian. Since most of the applications involved in the IoD are real-time based, the users are generally interested in accessing real-time information from drones belonging to a particular fly zone. This happens if we allow users to directly access real-time data from flying drones inside IoD environment and not from the server. This is a serious security breach which may deteriorate performance of any implemented solution in this IoD environment. To address this important issue in IoD, we propose a novel lightweight user authentication scheme in which a user in the IoD environment needs to access data directly from a drone provided that the user is authorized to access the data from that drone. The formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool along with informal security analysis show that our scheme is secure against several known attacks. The performance comparison demonstrates that our scheme is efficient with respect to various parameters, and it provides better security as compared to those for the related existing schemes. Finally, the practical demonstration of our scheme is done using the widely accepted NS2 simulation.",Drone,2019
Enhanced Drone Navigation in GNSS Denied Environment Using VDM and Hall Effect Sensor,"The last decade has witnessed a wide spread of small drones in many civil and military applications. With the massive advancement in the manufacture of small and lightweight Inertial Navigation System (INS), navigation in challenging environments became feasible. Navigation of these small drones mainly depends on the integration of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and INS. However, the navigation performance of these small drones deteriorates quickly when the GNSS signals are lost, due to accumulated errors of the low-cost INS that is typically used in these drones. During GNSS signal outages, another aiding sensor is required to bound the drift exhibited by the INS. Before adding any additional sensor on-board the drones, there are some limitations that must be taken into considerations. These limitations include limited availability of power, space, weight, and size. This paper presents a novel unconventional method, to enhance the navigation of autonomous drones in GNSS denied environment, through a new utilization of hall effect sensor to act as flying odometer Air-Odo and vehicle dynamic model (VDM) for heading estimation. The proposed approach enhances the navigational solution by estimating the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) velocity, and heading and fusing these measurements in the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) of the integrated system.",Drone,2019
Dual-axis rotary platform with UAV image recognition and tracking,"In recent years, rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has caused many problems in security. In order to prevent UAVs from random intrusion of no-fly zones and famous buildings, various anti-UAV defence systems (AUDS) have been developed in the world, including UAV radars, high energy laser guns, and other anti-UAV defence systems. However, these systems are expensive, making them difficult to be accepted by the general public. This paper develops a dual-axis rotary tracking platform for the anti-UAV defence system. It performs a scanning mission for aerial reconnaissance with full-color camera and thermal imager. When UAV enters the scope of visual detection, visual recognition function of this system immediately performs UAV dynamic coordinate tracking. By controlling the two-axis step motor with a dual-axis rotary platform, the dynamic coordinate of the UAV is tracked. The coordinate is then locked and the UAV image is aligned into frame center. In the meantime, Google Map is used for recording UAV flying trajectory.In the end, this article uses DJI MAVIC UAV to perform tracking test in the air. This research successfully performed the tracking task using methods of thermal and full color image at 30 m and 100 m. This tracking system also smoothly let Google Map perform dynamic path tracking of the UAV. This paper successfully completed the design and testing of a UAV tracking device, a key technology of anti-UAV defence systems.",Drone,2019
Deployment Strategies of Multiple Aerial BSs for User Coverage and Power Efficiency Maximization,"Unmanned aerial vehicle-based aerial base stations (BSs) can provide rapid communication services to ground users and are thus promising for future communication systems. In this paper, we consider a scenario where no functional terrestrial BSs are available and the aim is deploying multiple aerial BSs to cover a maximum number of users within a certain target area. To this end, we first propose a naive successive deployment method, which converts the non-convex constraints in the involved optimization into a combination of linear constraints through geometrical relaxation. Then, we investigate a deployment method based on K-means clustering. The method divides the target area into K convex subareas, where within each subarea, a mixed integer non-linear problem is solved. An iterative power efficient technique is further proposed to improve coverage probability with reduced power. Finally, we propose a robust technique for compensating the loss of coverage probability in the existence of inaccurate user location information. Our simulation results show that the proposed techniques achieve an up to 30% higher coverage probability when users are not distributed uniformly. In addition, the proposed simultaneous deployment techniques, especially the one using iterative algorithm, improve power-efficiency by up to 15% compared with the benchmark circle packing theory.",Drone,2019
QoS-Aware Cooperative Computation Offloading for Robot Swarms in Cloud Robotics,"Computation offloading is a promising solution to extend the capacity of robot swarms for computation-intensive applications because it allows robot swarms to benefit from the powerful computing resources of modern data centers. However, the existing computation-offloading approaches still face challenges: 1) multi-hop cooperative computation offloading, 2) joint computation offloading and routing, and 3) task slicing. In this paper, we propose a quality of service (QoS)-aware cooperative computation-offloading scheme for robot swarms using game theory. We analyze the multi-hop cooperative communication model in robot swarms and investigate the computation offloading and routing decision-making problems with the goals of both latency minimization and energy efficiency. We formulate the joint optimization problem as a multi-hop cooperative computation-offloading game and show the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) of the game for both unsliceable and sliceable tasks. We further propose a QoS-aware distributed algorithm to attain an NE and provide an upper bound on the price of anarchy in the game. Finally, our simulated results show that our algorithm scales well as the swarm size increases and it has a stable performance gain in various parameter settings.",Drone,2019
Behavior-Based Control for an Aerial Robotic Swarm in Surveillance Missions,"Aerial robotic swarms have shown benefits for performing search and surveillance missions in open spaces in the past. Among other properties, these systems are robust, scalable and adaptable to different scenarios. In this work, we propose a behavior-based algorithm to carry out a surveillance task in a rectangular area with a flexible number of quadcopters, flying at different speeds. Once the efficiency of the algorithm is quantitatively analyzed, the robustness of the system is demonstrated with 3 different tests: loss of broadcast messages, positioning errors, and failure of half of the agents during the mission. Experiments are carried out in an indoor arena with micro quadcopters to support simulation results. Finally, a case study is proposed to show a realistic implementation in the test bed.",Drone,2019
Energy-Efficient UAV-Enabled MEC System: Bits Allocation Optimization and Trajectory Design,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) system is attracting a lot of attentions for the potential of low latency and low transmission energy consumption, due to the advantages of high mobility and easy deployment. It has been widely applied to provide communication and computing services, especially in Internet of Things (IoT). However, there are still some challenges in the UAV-enabled MEC system. Firstly, the endurance of the UAV is limited and further impacts the performance of the system. Secondly, mobile devices are battery-powered and the batteries of some devices are hard to change. Therefore, in this paper, a UAV-enabled MEC system in which the UAV is empowered to have computing capability and provides tasks offloading service is studied. The total energy consumption of the UAV-enabled system, which includes the energy consumption of the UAV and the energy consumption of the ground users, is minimized under the constraints of the UAV's energy budget, the number of each task's bits, the causality of the data and the velocity of the UAV. The bits allocation of uploading data, computing data, downloading data and the trajectory of the UAV are jointly optimized with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption. Moreover, a two-stage alternating algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex formulated problem. Finally, the simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme compared with other benchmark schemes. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under different settings.",Drone,2019
Auto-landing guidance for unmanned aerial vehicle with engine flame-out,"Landing is the most dangerous phase of the entire flight phases. If the total loss of thrust occurs during flight, a powered aircraft converts to a glider, which can use kinetic and potential energy only. For this reason, a proper scheme is needed for safe landing in cases of the total loss of thrust. This paper presents three-dimensional unpowered auto-landing guidance based on trajectory generation, expanding the concept of the energy-to-range ratio. We develop the terminal velocity estimation method for a horizontal plane applied to three-dimensional space; this method is based on the previously suggested terminal velocity estimation method for a vertical plane. Then, we show trajectory generation for landing guidance combining vertical with horizontal waypoints. The proposed auto-landing guidance with trajectory generation is evaluated by numerical simulation.",Drone,2019
Robust adaptive compensation control for unmanned autonomous helicopter with input saturation and actuator faults,"This paper studies a robust adaptive compensation Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) for the medium-scale Unmanned Autonomous Helicopter (UAH) in the presence of external disturbances, actuator faults and input saturation. To improve the disturbance rejection capacity of the UAH system in actuator healthy case, an adaptive control method is adopted to cope with the external disturbances and a nominal controller is proposed to stabilize the system. Meanwhile, compensation control inputs are designed to reduce the negative effects derived from actuator faults and input saturation. Based on the backstepping control and inner-outer loop control technologies, a robust adaptive FTC scheme is developed to guarantee the tracking errors convergence. Under the presented FTC controller, the uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals is ensured via Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd.",Drone,2019
MVO-based path planning scheme with coordination of UAVs in 3-D environment,"The path planning of UAV deals with the process of figuring the most optimal path from the source to the destination and avoiding obstacles on course to avoid collisions in a given environment. This particular problem is classified as an optimisation problem in high dimension and comes under the category of NP-Hard. Due to the usage of UAVs in many domains like the army, communications, security, disaster management, survey mapping etc., the provisioning of time efficiency as well as accuracy is a critical and challenging task in a 3-D environment. Moreover, the ability of the UAVs can be enhanced if there is coordination between them to find the best cost-effective target in a dynamic manner. However, a majority of the solutions reported theoretically are not efficient concerning time efficiency, accuracy and coordination simultaneously for many applications. Drawing motivation from this, the paper gives a novel way of solving the problem of planning of path for UAVs in 3-D while maintaining the coordination for choosing the target. A new algorithm based on Multiverse optimizer (MVO) algorithm is applied to the problem. Munkres algorithm is applied for coordination of UAVs in case of multiple targets. By carrying out the simulations, on three different maps over 50 iterations the results shows that MVO algorithm perform better in the most of the cases for finding optimized path cost with minimum average execution time when compared to meta-heuristics GSO and BBO.

An Autonomous Threat Situation Awareness System for UAV based on Ontology,"An autonomous threat situational awareness system is necessary for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) in a variety of fields. Although various of approaches to autonomous threat situational awareness have been proposed, most of them involved reasoning of the semantic information of the object. Therefore, in this paper, based on the existing semantic information of an object, we propose a method to achieve threat situational awareness for a UAV based on reasoning of the relationship between the objects. In this paper, there are three main ways that are used to recognize a threat to a UAV: First, information on the recognized objects is expressed using an LOD(Level of Detail)-based grid map. Second, the concepts of objects around the UAV are defined as ontology while the relationships and situations between objects are defined as SWRL(Semantic Web Rule Language).Third, through the ontology reasoning, the simulator visualizes the recognition of the relationships of objects and threat situations for the UAV.",Drone,2019
Multivariable adaptive control based consensus flight control system for UAVs formation,"Formation flight contributes to improving the attack, reconnaissance and survival ability of the multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper studies a multivariable adaptive control based consensus flight method for UAVs formation. A majority of existing research is focused on the leader-following consensus problem assuming that only the parameters of followers are uncertain. However, they do not consider the leader dynamic uncertainty and the unknown external disturbances. Therefore, this paper addresses the problem of the UAVs consensus flight control with parametric uncertainties and unknown external disturbances for both the leader and follower. A multivariable model reference adaptive control (MRAC) based consensus flight control scheme is designed for UAVs formation, which enables the follower UAV to track the leader UAV. The stability of the multivariable MRAC based consensus flight control system is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed adaptive consensus flight control scheme has stronger robustness and adaptivity than the fixed control scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Aerodynamic layout optimization design of a barrel-launched UAV wing considering control capability of multiple control surfaces,"Owing to the size limitations of launchers, foldable main wings and foldable vertical tails are usually used in the design of barrel-launched unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and the folding mechanisms are complex and bulky. Further, the coupling effect between aerodynamic performance and control capability is not typically considered in the aerodynamic layout design of traditional drum-launched UAVs; thus, the overall performance is often improved by serial design and multi-turns optimization, which result in low design efficiency. Based on the available research on barrel-launched UAVs, this paper presents an optimal design scheme for non-vertical tail aerodynamic layout considering the control capability of multiple control surfaces. A flying-wing configuration, with two groups of ailerons and one group of all moving tips, is employed in the design, and its control capability and aerodynamic performance are quantitatively described in terms of the volume of attainable moment subset and lift-drag ratio. The focus of the current design is shifted from improvement of single aerodynamic performance to optimization of overall performance. To overcome the computational complexity observed in direct optimization, the number of design variables is reduced by identifying the key test factors. The concept of a surrogate model matrix comprising cell surrogate models is proposed to effectively fit the aerodynamic characteristics and control capability of the wing. A multi-objective optimization based on the surrogate model matrix is carried out using the neighborhood cultivation genetic algorithm, which effectively improves the optimization efficiency. The entire process is implemented on an ISIGHT platform for automatic optimization design of the wing. At two design points selected on the pareto frontier, the results show that the lift-drag ratio is increased by 28.36%, reachable torque space is increased by 64.29% in state 1, lift-drag ratio is increased by 23.11%, and reachable torque space is increased by 164.29% in state 2. These results provide a reference for the aerodynamic layout design of barrel-launched UAVs for practical control requirements. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
A Game Theoretic Approach for Mobility Prediction Clustering in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms have attracted great interests in numerous civil and military scenarios due to their flexible deployment and mobility. The increased network size poses a challenge for the network scalability. Clustering as an effective scheme, is able to provide efficient communication and network performance. In order to adapt to the change of network topology, the link subsistence probability is used to evaluate the mobility of UAVs. However, the UAVs usually perform tasks collaboratively, which leads to their movements are typically group-based. To this end, a coalition game theoretic framework is proposed to cluster UAVs into coalitions in a distributed autonomous manner, based on the group and the mobility information. The proposed game allows the UAVs with the same group, as much as possible, into one coalition under some constraints, such as cluster size and cluster diameter. To solve the game, each UAV makes its decision whether to switch based on the coalition value. Finally, some comparisons are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Airborne 3D SAR Imaging System for Subsurface Sensing: UWB-GPR on Board a UAV for Landmine and IED Detection,"This work presents an enhanced autonomous airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging system able to provide full 3D radar images from the subsurface. The proposed prototype and methodology allow the safe detection of both metallic and non-metallic buried targets even in difficult-to-access scenarios without interacting with the ground. Thus, they are particularly suitable for detecting dangerous targets, such as landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The prototype is mainly composed by an Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) radar module working from Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) band and a high accuracy dual-band Real Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning system mounted on board an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The UAV autonomously flies over the region of interest, gathering radar measurements. These measurements are accurately geo-referred so as to enable their coherent combination to obtain a well-focused SAR image. Improvements in the processing chain are also presented in order to deal with some issues associated to UAV-based measurements (such as non-uniform acquisition grids) as well as to enhance the resolution and the signal to clutter ratio of the image. Both the prototype and the methodology were validated with measurements, showing their capability to provide high-resolution 3D SAR images.",Drone,2019
Psychological Dimensions of Drone Warfare,"The use of weaponized drones or ""Bunmanned aerial vehicles"" (UAVs) has become increasingly widespread and controversial over the past few decades. The current paper reviews the state of the research regarding the potential psychosocial impact of weaponized drones on operators and target populations and communities. It is concluded that research regarding the impact of drones in the psychological literature remains limited and most discussion of drones' impact has taken place in the public policy and legal/ethical spheres, often by entities invested in condoning or condemning the use of drones. The limited available data addresses potential new challenges to the well-being of drone operators, factors influencing decision making regarding the use of drones, and the impact on target communities. The current paper neither condones nor condemns the use of drones, but is advanced as a state of the research and a call for additional objective and empirical analysis on this relatively new form of warfare.",Drone,2019
Bistatic Landmine and IED Detection Combining Vehicle and Drone Mounted GPR Sensors,"This work proposes a novel Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system to detect landmines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The system, which was numerically evaluated, is composed of a transmitter placed on a vehicle and looking forward and a receiver mounted on a drone and looking downwards. This combination offers both a good penetration and a high resolution, enabling the detection of non-metallic targets and mitigating the clutter at the air-soil interface. First, a fast ray tracing simulator was developed to find proper configurations of the system. Then, these configurations were validated using a full wave simulator, considering a flat and a rough surface. All simulations were post-processed using a fast and accurate Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) algorithm that takes into account the constitutive parameters of the soil. The SAR images for all configurations were compared, concluding that the proposed contribution greatly improves the target detection and the surface clutter reduction over conventional forward-looking GPR systems.",Drone,2019
Cooperative Multi-UAV Collision Avoidance Based on a Complex Network,"The conflict resolution problem in cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters sharing a three-dimensional airspace with increasing air traffic density is very important. This paper innovatively solves this problem by employing the complex network (CN) algorithm. The proposed approach allows a UAV to perform only one maneuver-that of the flight level change. The novel UAV conflict resolution is divided into two steps, corresponding to the key node selection (KS) algorithm based on the node contraction method and the sense selection (SS) algorithm based on an objective function. The efficiency of the cooperative multi-UAV collision avoidance (CA) system improved a lot due to the simple two-step collision avoidance logic. The paper compares the difference between random selection and the use of the node contraction method to select key nodes. Experiments showed that using the node contraction method to select key nodes can make the collision avoidance effect of UAVs better. The CA maneuver was validated with quantitative simulation experiments, demonstrating advantages such as minimal cost when considering the robustness of the global traffic situation, as well as significant real-time and high efficiency. The CN algorithm requires a relatively small computing time that renders the approach highly suitable for solving real-life operational situations.",Drone,2019
World ethanol trade to (sic) contract for first time in years,"United States and Brazil dominate both the global production and exports of ethanol. Though Brazil is a bit-part player in exports as it is also the major importer, importing from USA. The rest of the countries/regions producing ethanol lag behind significantly in production and exports/imports. Trade wars (e.g. US-China) and protectionist measures may serve to impose a marginal restraint on ethanol trade. Recent rebel drone strike against two oil installations in Saudi Arabia which has cut its crude oil output by 50% and resulted in global oil price increasing by 20% may be a significant driver in ethanol production if the situation persists.",Drone,2019
Estimating Flight Characteristics of Anomalous Unidentified Aerial Vehicles,"Several Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) encountered by military, commercial, and civilian aircraft have been reported to be structured craft that exhibit 'impossible' flight characteristics. We consider a handful of well-documented encounters, including the 2004 encounters with the Nimitz Carrier Group off the coast of California, and estimate lower bounds on the accelerations exhibited by the craft during the observed maneuvers. Estimated accelerations range from almost 100 g to 1000s of gs with no observed air disturbance, no sonic booms, and no evidence of excessive heat commensurate with even the minimal estimated energies. In accordance with observations, the estimated parameters describing the behavior of these craft are both anomalous and surprising. The extreme estimated flight characteristics reveal that these observations are either fabricated or seriously in error, or that these craft exhibit technology far more advanced than any known craft on Earth. In many cases, the number and quality of witnesses, the variety of roles they played in the encounters, and the equipment used to track and record the craft favor the latter hypothesis that these are indeed technologically advanced craft. The observed flight characteristics of these craft are consistent with the flight characteristics required for interstellar travel, i.e., if these observed accelerations were sustainable in space, then these craft could easily reach relativistic speeds within a matter of minutes to hours and cover interstellar distances in a matter of days to weeks, proper time.",Drone,2019
Physical Layer Security in UAV Systems: Challenges and Opportunities,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wireless communications has experienced an upsurge of interest in both military and civilian applications, due to its high mobility, low cost, on-demand deployment, and inherent line-of-sight air-to-ground channels. However, these benefits also make UAV wireless communication systems vulnerable to malicious eavesdropping attacks. In this article, we aim to examine the physical layer security issues in UAV systems. In particular, passive and active eavesdropping are two primary types of attack in UAV systems. We provide an overview on emerging techniques, such as trajectory design, resource allocation, and cooperative UAVs, to fight against both types of eavesdropping in UAV wireless communication systems. Moreover, the applications of non-orthogonal multiple access, multiple-input multiple-output, and millimeter-wave in UAV systems are also proposed to improve the system spectral efficiency and to guarantee security simultaneously. Finally, we discuss some potential research directions and challenges in terms of physical layer security in UAV systems.",Drone,2019
Airborne Visual Detection and Tracking of Cooperative UAVs Exploiting Deep Learning,"The performance achievable by using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for a large variety of civil and military applications, as well as the extent of applicable mission scenarios, can significantly benefit from the exploitation of formations of vehicles able to fly in a coordinated manner (swarms). In this respect, visual cameras represent a key instrument to enable coordination by giving each UAV the capability to visually monitor the other members of the formation. Hence, a related technological challenge is the development of robust solutions to detect and track cooperative targets through a sequence of frames. In this framework, this paper proposes an innovative approach to carry out this task based on deep learning. Specifically, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system is integrated within an original processing architecture in which the machine-vision algorithms are aided by navigation hints available thanks to the cooperative nature of the formation. An experimental flight test campaign, involving formations of two multirotor UAVs, is conducted to collect a database of images suitable to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate high-level accuracy, and robustness against challenging conditions in terms of illumination, background and target-range variability.",Drone,2019
Gunshot Airborne Surveillance with Rotary Wing UAV-Embedded Microphone Array,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are growing in popularity, and recent technological advances are fostering the development of new applications for these devices. This paper discusses the use of aerial drones as a platform for deploying a gunshot surveillance system based on an array of microphones. Notwithstanding the difficulties associated with the inherent additive noise from the rotating propellers, this application brings an important advantage: the possibility of estimating the shooter position solely based on the muzzle blast sound, with the support of a digital map of the terrain. This work focuses on direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods applied to audio signals obtained from a microphone array aboard a flying drone. We investigate preprocessing and different DoA estimation techniques in order to obtain the setup that performs better for the application at hand. We use a combination of simulated and actual gunshot signals recorded using a microphone array mounted on a UAV. One of the key insights resulting from the field recordings is the importance of drone positioning, whereby all gunshots recorded in a region outside a cone open from the gun muzzle presented a hit rate close to 96%. Based on experimental results, we claim that reliable bearing estimates can be achieved using a microphone array mounted on a drone.",Drone,2019
Localization and Clustering Based on Swarm Intelligence in UAV Networks for Emergency Communications,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been a focus area of the academic and industrial research community. They have been used in many military and civilian applications. Emergency communication is one of the essential requirements for first responders and victims in the aftermath of natural disasters. In such scenarios, UAVs may configure ad hoc wireless networks to cover a large area. In UAV networks, however, localization and routing are challenging tasks owing to the high mobility, unstable links, dynamic topology, and limited energy of UAVs. Here, we propose swarm-intelligencebased localization (SIL) and clustering schemes in UAV networks for emergency communications. First, we propose a new 3-D SIL algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) that exploits the particle search space in a limited boundary by using the bounding box method. In the 3-D search space, anchor UAV nodes are randomly distributed and the SIL algorithm measures the distance to existing anchor nodes for estimating the location of the target UAV nodes. Convergence time and localization accuracy are improved with lower computational cost. Second, we propose an energy-efficient swarm-intelligencebased clustering (SIC) algorithm based on PSO, in which the particle fitness function is exploited for intercluster distance, intracluster distance, residual energy, and geographic location. For energy-efficient clustering, cluster heads are selected based on improved particle optimization. The proposed SIC outperforms five typical routing protocols regarding packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and routing overhead. Moreover, SIC consumes less energy and prolongs network lifetime.",Drone,2019
Effects of injection timing and compression ratio on the combustion performance and emissions of a two-stroke DISI engine fuelled with aviation kerosene,"In recent years, many civilian and military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been powered by spark ignition (SI) piston engines fuelled with gasoline. However, the safety problems associated with the storage and transportation of gasoline are forcing manufacturers and researchers to develop an SI piston engine fuelled with heavy fuel, such as light diesel or aviation kerosene. In this study, the effects of injection timing and compression ratio on the combustion characteristics and emissions of a two-stroke engine fuelled with aviation kerosene rocket propellant 3 (RP-3) are investigated. The engine tests were carried out on a two-stroke, air cooled, direct injection, spark ignition engine at three compression ratios (7.2, 6.2, and 5.2) and injection timings from 120 crank angle (CA) before top dead center (BTDC) to 240 degrees CA BTDC. The engine was run at 4000 rpm, 100% throttle opening, and spark timing at knock limited spark advance.The results showed that the brake power (BP) increased and the coefficient of variation of the indicated mean effective pressure (COVIMEP) decreased with the advance in injection timing. The best brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was obtained at a direct injection timing of 150 degrees CA BTDC. Hydrocarbon (HC) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions increased while carbon monoxide (CO) emission decreased as the direct injection timing advanced. The compression ratios were decreased from 7.2 to 5.2, and the maximum values of BP and BTE were obtained at the compression ratio of 6.2. However, the HC and NO emissions at the compression ratio of 6.2 were greater than those under other compression ratios.",Drone,2019

"The role of culture in military innovation studies: Lessons learned from the US Air Force's adoption of the Predator Drone, 1993-1997","The purpose of this article is twofold. First, it contributes to our understanding of the role of culture in shaping innovation success and failure in the US Air Force, concluding that competing cultural norms explain the service's uneven and halting approach to the development and employment of the Predator drone. Second, it breaks new ground in the debate about the role of culture in military innovation. In contrast to earlier scholarship, it contends that it is possible to view culture as a central force in military innovation while adhering to the principles of positivism.",Drone,2019
Test analysis of a scalable UAV conflict management framework,"This study elaborates the conflict management framework of unmanned aerial vehicles, focusing on the identification of the spatiotemporal interdependencies between them, with consideration of the future scalability problems in highly dense traffic scenarios. The paper first tries to justify the applied separation criteria among small cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles based on their performance characteristics and the planned missions' type. The adopted criteria, obtained from the simulations of 160 missions, present a testing asset, referring to a current lack of the spatiotemporal requirements and a need for extending the research in this area to provide a more rapid integration of these vehicles into the civil controlled airspace. The paper then elaborates the computational framework for the conflict detection and resolution function and operational metrics for causal identification of the spatiotemporal interdependencies between two or more cooperative vehicles. The vehicles are considered as a conflict mission system that strives to achieve an efficient solution by applying certain maneuvering measures, before a loss of separation occurs. The operational trials of five local, short-range missions, supported by the simulation scenario, demonstrate the potential for a time-based complexity analysis in the conflict resolution processes with less demanding and more efficient coordinated maneuvers. The results show that those maneuvers would not induce any new conflicts and disrupt the cooperative mission system when the spatial capacity only might not be favorable in provision of the avoidance maneuvers within an available airspace.",Drone,2019
Detection of two Arctic birds in Greenland and an endangered bird in Korea using RGB and thermal cameras with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV),"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), so-called 'drones', have been widely used to monitor wild animals. Here, we tested a UAV with red, green, and blue (RGB) and thermal cameras to detect free-living birds in a high Arctic region in North Greenland and in a restricted area in the Republic of Korea. Small flocks of molting pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) near sea ice and incubating common ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) in the Arctic environment were chosen for the RGB and thermal image studies. From the acquired images, we built mosaicked RGB images and coregistered thermal images, and estimated the animal shapes. Our results showed that geese were discriminated in both RGB and thermal images with water and sea ice backgrounds. Incubating plover bodies were not distinguished in RGB images due to their cryptic coloration, but they were detected in thermal images with cold background areas in the Arctic environment. We further conducted a blind survey in a restricted area under military control in Korea near the breeding sites of black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), which is an endangered species. From UAV flights with RGB and thermal cameras operated out of the restricted area, we acquired images of white objects in the mudflats and verified that the objects were resting spoonbills by watching the birds. We suggest that thermal cameras and UAVs can be applied to monitor animals in extreme environments and in restricted areas and help researchers find cryptic wader nests.",Drone,2019
A comprehensive micro unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV/Drone) forensic framework,"In the early 1990s, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) were used exclusively in military applications by various developed countries. Now with its ease of availability and affordability in the electronic device market, this aerial vehicular technology has augmented its familiarity in public and has expanded its usage to countries all over the world. However, expanded use of UAVs, colloquially known as drones, is raising understandable security concerns. With the increasing possibility of drones' misuse and their abilities to get close to critical targets, drones are prone to potentially committing crimes and, therefore, investigation of such activities is a much-needed facet. This motivated us to devise a comprehensive drone forensic framework that includes hardware/physical and digital forensics, proficient enough for the post-flight investigation of drone's activity. For hardware/physical forensics, we propose a model for investigating drone components at the crime scene. Additionally, we propose a robust digital drone forensic application with a primary focus on analyzing the essential log parameters of drones through a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using JavaFX 8.0. This application interface would allow users to extract and examine onboard flight information. It also includes a file converter created for easy and effective 3D flight trajectory visualization. We used two popular drones for conducting this research; namely, DJI Phantom 4 and Yuneec Typhoon H. The interface also provides a visual representation of the sensor recordings from which pieces of evidence could be acquired. Our research is intended to offer the forensic science community a powerful approach for investigating drone-related crimes effectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Deciding on Appropriate Use of Force: Human-machine Interaction in Weapons Systems and Emerging Norms,"This article considers the role of norms in the debate on autonomous weapons systems (AWS). It argues that the academic and political discussion is largely dominated by considerations of how AWS relate to norms institutionalised in international law. While this debate on AWS has produced insights on legal and ethical norms and sounded options of a possible regulation or ban, it neglects to investigate how complex human-machine interactions in weapons systems can set standards of appropriate use of force, which are politically normatively relevant but take place outside of formal, deliberative law-setting. While such procedural norms are already emerging in the practice of contemporary warfare, the increasing technological complexity of AI-driven weapons will add to their political-normative relevance. I argue that public deliberation about and political oversight and accountability of the use of force is at risk of being consumed and normalised by functional procedures and perceptions. This can have a profound impact on future of remote-warfare and security policy.",Drone,2019
Drone Proliferation and the Challenge of Regulating Dual-Use Technologies,"The controversy surrounding military drones has generated many proposals for restricting or prohibiting existing drones, additional autonomous variants that may be created in the future, and the sale of drones to certain markets. Moreover, there is broad interest in regulating military drones, with proposals coming not only from academics but also from NGOs and policymakers. I argue that these proposals generally fail to consider the dual-use character of drones and that they therefore provide inadequate regulatory guidance. Drones are not confined to the military but rather spread across international and domestic security roles, humanitarian relief efforts, and dozens of civilian applications. Drones, their component technologies, the control infrastructure, and the relevant technical expertise would continue to develop under a military-focused regulatory regime as civilian technologies that have the potential to be militarized. I evaluate the prospects of drone regulation with the help of research on other dual-use technologies, while also showing what the study of drones can contribute to that literature. Drones' ubiquity in nonmilitary roles presents special regulatory challenges beyond those associated with WMDs and missiles, which indicates that strict regulatory controls or international governance frameworks are unlikely to succeed. With this in mind, I further argue that future research should acknowledge that drone proliferation across military and civilian spheres is unavoidable and shift focus to considering how drone warfare may be moderated by countermeasures and institutional pressures.",Drone,2019
UAV Group Formation Collision Avoidance Method Based on Second-Order Consensus Algorithm and Improved Artificial Potential Field,"The problem of collision avoidance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) group is studied in this paper. A collision avoidance method of UAV group formation based on second-order consensus algorithm and improved artificial potential field is proposed. Based on the method, the UAV group can form a predetermined formation from any initial state and fly to the target position in normal flight, and can avoid collision according to the improved smooth artificial potential field method when encountering an obstacle. The UAV group adopts the ""leader-follower"" strategy, that is, the leader UAV is the controller and flies independently according to the mission requirements, while the follower UAV follows the leader UAV based on the second-order consensus algorithm and formations gradually form during the flight. Based on the second-order consensus algorithm, the UAV group can achieve formation maintenance easily and the Laplacian matrix used in the algorithm is symmetric for an undirected graph. In the process of obstacle avoidance, the improved artificial potential field method can solve the jitter problem that the traditional artificial potential field method causes for the UAV and avoids violent jitter. Finally, simulation experiments of two scenarios were designed to verify the collision avoidance effect and formation retention effect of static obstacles and dynamic obstacles while the two UAV groups fly in opposite symmetry in the dynamic obstacle scenario. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Cooperative Unmanned Aerial System Reconnaissance in a Complex Urban Environment and Uneven Terrain,"Using unmanned robotic systems in military operations such as reconnaissance or surveillance, as well as in many civil applications, is common practice. In this article, the problem of monitoring the specified area of interest by a fleet of unmanned aerial systems is examined. The monitoring is planned via the Cooperative Aerial Model, which deploys a number of waypoints in the area; these waypoints are visited successively by unmanned systems. The original model proposed in the past assumed that the area to be explored is perfectly flat. A new formulation of this model is introduced in this article so that the model can be used in a complex environment with uneven terrain and/or with many obstacles, which may occlude some parts of the area of interest. The optimization algorithm based on the simulated annealing principles is proposed for positioning of waypoints to cover as large an area as possible. A set of scenarios has been designed to verify and evaluate the proposed approach. The key experiments are aimed at finding the minimum number of waypoints needed to explore at least the minimum requested portion of the area. Furthermore, the results are compared to the algorithm based on the lawnmower pattern.",Drone,2019
Predictive feedback augmentation for manual control of an unmanned aerial vehicle with latency,"Teleoperation of unmanned aerial vehicles is hampered by communication delay, which causes feedback from command inputs to take considerable time to be displayed to the operator. For an international internet connection, round trip latencies can reach 500 ms. The satellite connections used for military unmanned aerial vehicles can have latencies in the order of seconds. This delay presents a substantial control problem, which has been solved in the past by control abstraction (instead of ""roll left"" the aircraft might be instructed ""go to these coordinates""). Manual control remains difficult. This study borrows the client-side prediction concept from multiplayer video games to attempt to address the control delay to allow manual control. An estimate of the change in the vehicle state due to the commands that are yet to affect the feedback is computed and then the feedback that the pilot receives is modified to reflect this predicted change. Because of this change, the pilot can see immediately the effect of the control inputs. This study has explored the concept and built a prototype system functional in real time for flight testing with qualitative results presented.",Drone,2019
Flatness-based finite-time leader-follower formation control of multiple quadrotors with external disturbances,"This study considers the leader-follower formation control problem for multiple quadrotors in the presence of external disturbances. Based on the differential flatness theory, the underactuated quadrotor system is transformed into a fully actuated one with four degrees of freedom and four control inputs. Based on this model, a distributed finite-time observer is developed to reconstruct the leader's states for each follower. Then, an observer-based finite-time controller is proposed based on an adaptive disturbance rejection approach, which is independent of the upper bounds of the disturbances, to address the formation control problem for multiple quadrotors. The stability analysis indicates that the closed-loop system theoretically achieves the finite-time stability and robustness against the disturbances. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to verify the performance of the proposed formation control scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Adaptive constrained backstepping controller with prescribed performance methodology for carrier-based UAV,"A novel adaptive constrained backstepping control with prescribed performance methodology for carrier-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of uncertainties, input constraints and unknown external disturbances is presented in this paper. This controller can guarantee the compensation tracking errors of the carrier-based UAV with prescribed performance including the steady and transient performance. Firstly, a new transformed system based on the compensation tracking errors, not the traditional tracking errors, is designed. Secondly, to deal with the UAV input constraints, the constrained command filters is introduced and the auxiliary dynamic is designed to eliminate the effect of input saturation. Thirdly, the prescribed performance methodology is introduced and the transient performance of the compensation tracking error is analyzed. It is proved that the proposed controller guarantees that all the signals of the closed-loop system are bounded by using Lyapunov method. Finally, the 6-DOF nonlinear carrier-based UAV model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law. The simulation results show that the proposed controller is able to provide accurate tracking and satisfy the prescribed performance with unknown aerodynamic parameters, input constraints and external disturbances environment.

Morphing control of a new bionic morphing UAV with deep reinforcement learning,"With rapid development of aviation technology, materials science and artificial intelligence, aircraft design is pursuing higher requirements both in civil and military fields. The new generation of aircraft should have the autonomous capable of performing a variety of tasks (such as take-off and landing, cruising, maneuvering, hover, attack, etc.) under a highly variable flight environment (height, Mach number, etc.) and meanwhile maintaining good performance. Morphing aircraft can use smart materials and actuators to autonomously deform the shape according to the changes in flight environment and mission, and always maintain an optimal aerodynamic shape, therefore get flourished developments. Based on the ability of birds to stretch wings when flying at low speed and to constrict wings at high speed, a new bionic morphing UAV has been designed and developed as the study model by our team. In order to make this new aircraft be able to complete rapid autonomous morphing and aerodynamic performance optimization under different missions and flight conditions, we developed deep neural networks and reinforcement learning techniques as a control strategy. Considering the continuity of the state and action spaces for model, the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on the actor-critic, model-free algorithm was adopted and verified on the classic nonlinear Pendulum model and Cart Pole game. After the feasibility was verified, morphing aircraft model was controlled to complete prescribed deformation using DDPG algorithm. Furthermore, on the condition that the DDPG algorithm can control morphing well, through training and testing on model using simulation data from wind tunnel tests and actual flight, the autonomous morphing control for the shape optimization of the bionic morphing UAV model could be realized.

Battlefield Mercy: Unpacking the Nature and Significance of Supererogation in War,"Debates over how best to ensure appropriate conduct in battle typically draw a binary distinction between rule compliance and rule violation. This framing is problematic, excluding a critical third element of battlefield conduct, supererogation-that is, positive acts that go beyond what is demanded by the explicit rules of war. This article investigates this moral category of action; specifically, situations in which combatants refrain from taking the life of an enemy despite their moral and legal license to do so. It first considers the moral tension between the duty of combatants to kill and battlefield mercy, and goes on to explore the factors that motivate the latter. The article then shifts to consider the significance of supererogation to the ongoing efforts to moderate the conduct of contemporary war. As the article illustrates, supererogatory restraint is constituted by values that when cultivated also incentivize adherence to the more explicit rules and standards of the battlefield. This is demonstrated through analysis of the conduct of Western special forces. The concept of supererogation is of further use when evaluating the origins and implications of ""moral injury."" This is verified empirically in the context of armed unmanned aerial vehicles.",Drone,2019
Reliable State Estimation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Over a Distributed Wireless IoT Network,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a lot of attention due to their enormous potentiality in civil and military applications over the past years. In order to allow accurate control action of UAV, a robust and real-time state estimation technique is required. In this paper, we propose a Kalman filter based UAV state estimation technique when the communication takes place over wireless links in an Internet of Things (IoT) network. We consider that a set of sensors observes the state of the UAV and transmits the observation to a control center (central server) over a distributed wireless IoT network. To deal with the communication impairments due to wireless communication links between the UAV's sensors and the IoT system components, e.g., IoT gateways, a Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem coded communication system is presented. Based on the received signals at the IoT gateways, a global state estimation technique is proposed. Performance of the proposed communication and estimation scheme is demonstrated through numerical results for different conditions. From the comparison with a conventional estimation scheme, it is observed that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the conventional scheme in terms of state estimation and error performance.",Drone,2019

"The Language We Use Matters: Streams, Narratives, and the Obama Administration Drone Strike Program in Yemen","Despite its ubiquity in the literature, John Kingdon's multiple streams framework (MSF) has rarely been applied to defense and foreign policy domains. Moreover, as a rationalist-based systemic explanation, scholars have generally underappreciated the framework's attention to the role of ideas and policy narratives. Deriving theoretical insights from the narrative policy framework (NPF), this article marries MSF's systemic components with a policy narrative-based explanatory logic to examine decision coupling in the Obama administration's lethal drone strike program in Yemen. Narrative-specific meanings associated with MSF's systemic features offer both theoretical insight on how the streams interact with respect to the drone program and how policy narratives offer a vehicle for better explaining the manipulation of ambiguity in the policy process. Policy narratives can be seen as cause and effect stories designed to bias certain policy decisions and provide important insights for enriching conventional MSF explanatory mechanisms, including manipulation, decision coupling, and alternative selection.",Drone,2019

Norm transformation and the institutionalization of targeted killing in the US,"This article explains the emergence and institutionalization of the US's targeted killing practices as a case of norm transformation. I argue that international and domestic US prohibitions on assassination have not disappeared, but have changed as a result of practitioner-led changes in the conventions, technologies, and bureaucratic structures governing the use of force in counterterrorism activities. After discussing the limits of alternative explanations, and drawing inspiration from practice theory, pragmatist social theory, and relational sociology, I posit three causal mechanisms as responsible for the transformation: convention reorientation, which was the redefinition of targeted killing to distinguish it from assassination; technological revision, which was the development and use of unmanned aerial vehicles (""drones"") to bypass normative and strategic concerns over precision; and network synthesis, which was the support of the Bush administration and especially of the Obama administration, overruling dissenters from within the Central Intelligence Agency (who were often very highly placed). I trace the processes by which these mechanisms operated and interacted in simultaneous and mutually reinforcing ways from the start of the millennium until now. Finally, I discuss some of the ways in which this contributes to institutional analysis and the study of norm change more generally, and, in particular, how it considers the role of technology and the reciprocity of means and ends.",Drone,2019
Missile-Target-Defender Problem with Incomplete a Priori Information,"On the plane, the missile-target-defender problem is considered, in which a mobile target with a minimum turn radius evades from a constant speed and rectilinearly moving missile or torpedo. For the missile interception, the target uses a defending missile (mobile false target, decoy, strike UAV or AUV). The problem is complicated by the fact that at the instant of launch of the defending missile, the target knows only the bearing of the missile and its speed, while the information about the distance to the missile and its velocity vector is not available. In this work, the optimal program is constructed for the trajectory of the defending missile, which intercepts all the dangerous (from the point of view of the target) directions of possible missile motion.",Drone,2019
Cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles with privacy preserving deep vision for real-time object identification and tracking,"Human tracking is an important challenge in a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to, surveillance, military operations, and disaster relief services. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) allow the surveying of dangerous or impassable areas from a safe distance. They also provide a machine-based capability, which may not only solve resource constraint issues, but can also improve effectiveness and efficiency in the tracking task. The effectiveness of tracking is directly related to the angle of view and degree of freedom of the camera system. In this paper, we introduce a decentralized, distributed deep learning algorithm for Real-Time Privacy-preserving Target Tracking Re-Identification (RPTF-ReID) used by cooperative UAVs in complex and adversarial environments involving motion, crowded scenes, and varied camera angles. The efficiency of RPTT-ReID makes it amenable to edge computing applications. The proposed algorithmic approach resolves shortfalls with current tracking algorithms, specifically challenges in maintaining tracking when subjects cross paths, switch identity, or are occluded in a frame of view. We demonstrate the power of our approach both in single and multi-UAV scenarios to track movable targets by extracting the facial embedding information in crowds, in order to ensure the privacy of individuals captured by the UAVs without compromising the capability for target re-identification. We validate RPTT-RelD on a challenging video dataset of crowded scenes. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach is capable of tracking and re-identifying people in crowds despite blended trajectories with minimum and maximum accuracy of 79.91 +/- 0.2% and 93.27 +/- 0.1% respectively.

Decentralized Algorithms for Weapon-Target Assignment in Swarming Combat System,"Swarming small unmanned aerial or ground vehicles (UAVs or UGVs) have attracted the attention of worldwide military powers as weapons, and the weapon-target assignment (WTA) problem is extremely significant for swarming combat. The problem involves assigning weapons to targets in a decentralized manner such that the total damage effect of targets is maximized while considering the nonlinear cumulative damage effect. Two improved optimization algorithms are presented in the study. One is the redesigned auction-based algorithm in which the bidding rules are properly modified such that the auction-based algorithm is applied for the first time to solve a nonlinear WTA problem. The other one is the improved task swap algorithm that eliminates the restriction in which the weights of the edges on graph G must be positive. Computational results for up to 120 weapons and 110 targets indicate that the redesigned auction-based algorithm yields an average improvement of 37% over the conventional auction-based algorithm in terms of solution quality while the additional running time is negligible. The improved task swap algorithm and the other two popular task swap algorithms almost achieve the same optimal value, while the average time-savings of the proposed algorithm correspond to 53% and 74% when compared to the other two popular task swap algorithms. Furthermore, the hybrid algorithm that combines the above two improved algorithms is examined. Simulations indicate that the hybrid algorithm exhibits superiority in terms of solution quality and time consumption over separately implementing the aforementioned two improved algorithms.",Drone,2019
Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells,"Since the first report on solid-state perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with 9.7% efficiency and 500-h long-term stability in 2012, PSCs have achieved an amazing power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.2%, exceeding the PCEs of multi-crystalline Si (22.3%), thin-film crystalline Si (21.2%), copper indium gallium selenide (22.6%), and CdTe-based thin-film SCs (22.1%), and are suitable for transforming into flexible solar cells based on plastic substrates. The light weight and flexibility of flexible-PSCs (F-PSCs) allows their use in niche applications such as portable electric chargers, electronic textiles, large-scale industrial roofing, and power sources for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the F-PSCs always exhibit inferior efficiency compared to rigid PSCs, i.e., champion-cell efficiency of F-PSCs is 19.11%, which is apparently lower than that of rigid cells. Also, the world-best module efficiency for rigid perovskite module is 17.18% (30 cm(2)) higher than that for flexible perovskite module efficiency, 15.22% (30 cm(2)). Moreover, the F-PSCs have not shown better long-term stability in comparison with rigid PSCs. In this review paper, we investigate fundamental challenges of F-PSCs regarding relatively low efficiency and stability and demonstrate the recent efforts to overcome big hurdles. Also, current attempts for the commercialization of F-PSCs are introduced.",Drone,2019
Glocal Pacification by Vertical Means: The Case of Droneland Policing,"The article investigates drones' attribution to securitise, surveil and pacify border regimes within a threefold, even though contradictory, development: Firstly, borders as demarcation lines or check-points are redefined into border spaces. Secondly, the failing of an out-bound targeted and state-led border security system turns into the claimed necessity for new inner security measures. Within a framework of a technologised migration management, thirdly, a militarisation of internal security occurs within which different capital fractions compete for market shares in policing migration and managing minorities. The drone-a peripheral device just a couple of years ago-turns into the centrepiece of pacification endeavours and the device to draw all battle lines. The (for some) faraway Afgh-Pak combat drone turns into the peripheral border drone finally approaching us as a homeland drone.",Drone,2019
Anarchitectures of health: Futures for the biomedical drone,"In recent years, research on the military deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, has proliferated. However, to date there has been little systematic study of how drones are being used for health surveillance and management, particularly in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we draw on a number of case studies to explore how the biomedical drone is contributing to a re-spatialization of health and to a process of datafication that is set to fundamentally change the nature and scope of health governance. The promotion of the drone as a solution to global challenges reflects a broader techno-optimism. However, drones and the cybernetworks they rely on are short-circuiting terrestrial systems and driving a strategic, hotspot approach to health. This targeted view of the world, we argue, recapitulates and extends earlier forms of colonial surveillance and intervention premised on security and incipient threat. We develop the notion of 'anarchitecture' to describe the formation of these new inverted health landscapes where state infrastructures are entangled with shifting technological networks. In short, we seek to develop a framework for reflecting on the ways in which global health is being reconfigured through the development of remote-sensing technologies and cyberinfrastructures.",Drone,2019
Modeling of processes of security assurance from threats caused by unmanned air vehicles,"At the present time new methods of threats implementation with respect to nuclear facilities are being developed. This creates a need to improve methodological approaches to the security systems effectiveness evaluation. Modem security violation methods include the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as elements of external influence on the facilities protection. The paper considers a method to evaluate a physical protection system (PPS) effectiveness of threats countering performed with the help of UAV. The method is based on the interaction simulation techniques in the ""adversary - PPS"" system. The paper describes the algorithms for this simulation. They include specialized software instruments for building and analysis of the interaction model for a specific facility. The results of the analysis of different impact options on the security system elements are presented with the proposed approach application. The article also covers the possibility to identify the critical scenarios, which arc possible in real conditions of UAV usage, with respect to the reviewed system. To forecast the condition of the facility's protection and the processes of external influence on the PPS the most significant factors and causes of their occurrence were identified. The characteristics of the interaction processes in the ""adversary - PPS"" system were formed based on the received data. Then the PPS effectiveness of the discussed threats countering was evaluated.",Drone,2019
Modelling and control of a spatial dynamic cable,"We study the problem of dynamically controlling the shape of a cable that is fixed at one end and attached to an actuated robot at another end. This problem is relevant to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) tethered to a base. While rotorcrafts, such as quadcopters, are agile and versatile in their applications and have been widely used in scientific, industrial, and military applications, one of the biggest challenges with such UAVs is their limited battery life that make the flight time for a typical UAVs limited to twenty to thirty minutes for most practical purposes. A solution to this problem lies in the use of cables that tether the UAV to a power outlet for constant power supply. However, the cable needs to be controlled effectively in order to avoid obstacles or other UAVs. In this paper, we develop methods for controlling the shape of a cable using actuation at one end. We propose a discrete model for the spatial cable and derive the equations governing the cable dynamics for both force controlled system and position controlled system. We design a controller to control the shape of the cable to attain the desired shape and perform simulations under different conditions. Finally, we propose a quasi-static model for the spatial cable and discuss the stability of this system and the proposed controller.",Drone,2019
An SDN-MQTT Based Communication System for Battlefield UAV Swarms,"The UAV swarm is one of the most important developing trends in modern military operations. It is anticipated that in the near future, modern countries will embrace the use of UAV swarms across nearly every operating environment. The overall structure of a swarm, which is open, self-organizing, self-forming, and power saving friendly, makes it suitable for the battlefield, and it urgently needs to be defined. This article proposes an SDN and MQTT hybrid structure for battlefield UAV swarms, which is flexible, adaptable, intelligent, and controllable for topology, bandwidth, and payloads. The structure can adapt to the frequent change of swarm formation, support flexible data transmission among payloads, and improve swarm security in the battlefield. Furthermore, we propose a QoS-based multi-path routing framework, which calculates multiple disjointed paths from sources to destinations in order to enhance network performance. Case studies are listed and analyzed to validate the structure.",Drone,2019
Low-Slow-Small (LSS) Target Detection Based on Micro Doppler Analysis in Forward Scattering Radar Geometry,"The increase in drone misuse by civilian apart from military applications is alarming and need to be addressed. This drone is characterized as a low altitude, slow speed, and small radar cross-section (RCS) (LSS) target and is considered difficult to be detected and classified among other biological targets, such as insects and birds existing in the same surveillance volume. Although several attempts reported the successful drone detection on radio frequency-based (RF), thermal, acoustic, video imaging, and other non-technical methods, however, there are also many limitations. Thus, this paper investigated a micro-Doppler analysis from drone rotating blades for detection in a special Forward Scattering Radar (FSR) geometry. The paper leveraged the identified benefits of FSR mode over conventional radars, such as improved radar cross-section (RCS) value irrespective of radar absorbing material (RAM), direct signal perturbation, and high resolutions. To prove the concept, a received signal model for micro-Doppler analysis, a simulation work, and experimental validation are elaborated and explained in the paper. Two rotating blades aspect angle scenarios were considered, which are (i) when drone makes a turn, the blade cross-sectional area faces the receiver and (ii) when drone maneuvers normally, the cross-sectional blade faces up. The FSR system successfully detected a commercial drone and extracted the micro features of a rotating blade. It further verified the feasibility of using a parabolic dish antenna as a receiver in FSR geometry; this marked an appreciable achievement towards the FSR system performance, which in future could be implemented as either active or passive FSR system.",Drone,2019
Theorizing the advent of weaponized drones as techniques of domestic paramilitary policing,"The killing of Micah Johnson by Dallas police using a teleguided exploding robot on 8 July 2016 is the first known example of the use of a killer drone by US law enforcement in the domestic arena. This repatriation of the drone, under conditions of racialized urban unrest designated as exceptional, was predicted by Didier Bigo and follows a familiar pattern whereby coercive security technologies are tested abroad before finding their way 'home' to arm police forces that are becoming increasingly paramilitary in style and conduct. I use the Dallas incident to probe the cogency and limits of 'drone theory' and to consider its application in domestic policing contexts. I work through three broadly delineated areas of scepticism about drone theory as it intersects with policing and, in so doing, develop my own account of the weaponized policing drone as a defining techno-cultural element within the emergent form of neoliberal political rationality I call 'governance'.",Drone,2019
"Cyber-attacks on unmanned aerial system networks: Detection, countermeasure, and future research directions","For an unmanned aerial system (UAS) to operate successfully, it has to communicate reliably with different entities within its network. These entities include other aircraft and UAS, ground control stations, navigation satellite systems, and air traffic control systems. However, these systems are vulnerable to different cyber-attacks including message injection, message modification, jamming, and GPS spoofing. These attacks can mislead not only UAS and aircraft, but also pilots and air traffic controllers, leading potentially to collisions and human casualties. Over the last decade, a number of technological solutions for multiple UAS problems have been developed. Yet, few works related to UAS cybersecurity have been done. This paper provides an overview of UAS vulnerabilities, cyber-attacks, and the state-of-the-art in detection and countermeasure techniques. Attacks are classified according to their types and defense strategies for the most important attacks are discussed and compared. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Semi-Automated Emergency Landing Site Selection Approach for UAVs,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in military and industry today is becoming more widespread. There are a wide range of UAV models that are functional today. The size of these UAVs can be as small as a hawk and can be as big as a passenger jetliner. It is critical for these UAVs to have contingency plans before flight in case of unexpected situations, such as engine-out events which cause total loss of thrust during flight. An important part of contingency planning is to identify emergency landing sites along the flight path of the UAV. This paper discusses the development of an offline semi-automated approach for finding emergency landing sites in the shape of a rectangular runway to be used in preflight contingency planning. The approach introduces a total of five emergency landing measures and a surface type estimation, which are applied to the identified emergency landing site candidates for their safety assessment. The output is a list of emergency landing site candidates together with their surface type estimates that are ranked from the safest to least safe through a generalized safety score for each surface type. The approach can label the ranked landing site candidates according to their reachability in the presence of wind, given the UAV's altitude and coordinates at the time the total loss of thrust happened and the wind forecast for the area.",Drone,2019
On non-collision flocking and line-shaped spatial configuration for a modified singular Cucker-Smale model,"This paper is concerned with a singular Cucker-Smale model with a general targeted pattern driving force, which ensures that the particles finally come to the desired spatial configuration. Under some suitable conditions, we prove that the exponent alpha >= 1 in the communication weight leads to global regularity of solutions so that the system has an asymptotic flocking without collision between any agent. As an example, a prescribed driving force is given to demonstrate that the particles finally come to a line-shaped formation with collision avoidance, which can be viewed as a reasonable explanation for the wild geese flying in a line-shape in the sky. Moreover, this mechanism can be applied to the UAVs forming a line-shape to complete some special military missions. These results are novel, which are illustrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Drone,2019
Fixed-Time Formation Control of Multirobot Systems: Design and Experiments,"Time delays exist in network-connected systems. Especially for vision-based multirobot systems, time delays are diverse and complicated due to the communication network, camera latency, image processing, etc. At the same time, many tasks, such as searching and rescue, have timing requirement. This paper focuses on fixed-time formation control of multirobot systems subject to delay constraints. First, predictor-based state transformation is employed for each robot to deal with the input delay, and the uncertain terms remained in the transformed systems are carefully considered. Then, a couple of nonlinear fixed-time formation protocols are proposed for the multirobot systems with respectively undirected and directed topology, and the corresponding settling time is derived by using the Lyapunov functions. In particular, the upper-bound estimation of the formation settling time is explicitly given irrelevant to the initial conditions. Finally, the protocols are validated through a numerical simulation example and then implemented on an E-puck robots platform. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formation protocols.",Drone,2019
Hyperspectral Imaging in Environmental Monitoring: A Review of Recent Developments and Technological Advances in Compact Field Deployable Systems,"The development and uptake of field deployable hyperspectral imaging systems within environmental monitoring represents an exciting and innovative development that could revolutionize a number of sensing applications in the coming decades. In this article we focus on the successful miniaturization and improved portability of hyperspectral sensors, covering their application both from aerial and ground-based platforms in a number of environmental application areas, highlighting in particular the recent implementation of low-cost consumer technology in this context. At present, these devices largely complement existing monitoring approaches, however, as technology continues to improve, these units are moving towards reaching a standard suitable for stand-alone monitoring in the not too distant future. As these low-cost and light-weight devices are already producing scientific grade results, they now have the potential to significantly improve accessibility to hyperspectral monitoring technology, as well as vastly proliferating acquisition of such datasets.",Drone,2019
"A ""Star Wars"" sequel? The allure of directed energy for space weapons","The high-energy lasers of the 1980s were unwieldy assemblages of tanks, tubes, and plumbing that produced light by burning flowing gases, and the space shuttle was not ready for space trucking. In the decades since then, though, laser technology has come a long way, and the giggle factor of these technologies - dubbed Star Wars weapons by their detractors - is gone. High-energy solid-state lasers, not available in the Reagan era, are now being tested to shoot down rockets, mortars, and drones at hundreds of meters or more on the battlefield. Their success so far has led the Pentagon to reconsider high-energy lasers and other directed energy weapons for missile defense and perhaps other military applications on the fringes of space and in orbit. But are new actors merely making the same mistakes again, in an updated setting?",Drone,2019
Development of UAV Tracing and Coordinate Detection Method Using a Dual-Axis Rotary Platform for an Anti-UAV System,"The rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to many security problems. In order to prevent UAVs from invading restricted areas or famous buildings, an anti-UAV defense system (AUDS) has been developed and become a research topic of interest. Topics under research in relation to this include electromagnetic interference guns for UAVs, high-energy laser guns, US military net warheads, and AUDSs with net guns. However, these AUDSs use either manual aiming or expensive radar to trace drones. This research proposes a dual-axis mechanism with UAVs automatic tracing. The tracing platform uses visual image processing technology to trace and lock the dynamic displacement of a drone. When a target UAV is locked, the system uses a nine-axis attitude meter and laser rangers to measure its flight altitude and calculates its longitude and latitude coordinates through sphere coordinates to provide drone monitoring for further defense or attack missions. Tracing tests of UAV flights in the air were carried out using a DJI MAVIC UAV at a height of 30 m to 100 m. It was set up for drone image capture and visual identification for tracing under various weather conditions by a thermal imaging camera and a full-color camera, respectively. When there was no cloud during the daytime, the images acquired by the thermal imaging camera and full-color camera provide a high-quality image identification result. However, under dark weather, black clouds will emit radiant energy and seriously affect the capture of images by a thermal imaging camera. When there is no cloud at night, the thermal imaging camera performs well in drone image capture. When the drone is traced and locked, the system can effectively obtain the flight altitude and longitude and latitude coordinate values.",Drone,2019
Projection Modification Based Robust Adaptive Backstepping Control for Multipurpose Quadcopter UAV,"In this paper, the robust adaptive control scheme based on backstepping technique is presented that improves the trajectory tracking performance of the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), specially tasked for supply, rescue and combat missions. The proposed control scheme is designed to estimate all the system parameters that may posses uncertainties and effectively rejects the completely unknown time varying external disturbances. The adaptive laws, derived through Lyapunov stability theorem are robustified by merging with derivative-integral (DI) term, resulting in rapid and accurate adaptation. In addition, to avoid parametric drift phenomenon, we introduce the projection modification (PM) in the designed DI-adaptive laws that ensures the closed-loop system signals bounded. The trajectory tracking and parameter estimation performance of the UAV in the presence of external disturbances, the payload pick up/drop off effect on altitude and recoil effect on attitude is analyzed by means of numerical simulations. The results validate strict robustness with extended applicability of proposed control scheme.",Drone,2019
Multi-UAV Cooperative Patrol Task Planning Novel Method Based on Improved PFIH Algorithm,"This paper investigates the cooperative patrol task planning problems for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles by considering the patrol task requirements. A new cooperative patrol task planning approach is proposed to complete the patrol task. Firstly, the cooperative patrol task planning model for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles is established. Then, the corresponding complex constraint condition processing method with two steps is designed; that is, obtaining the initial result via Floyd algorithm firstly and then generating the optimal solution by adopting the improved Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (IPFIH) algorithm. It is proved that the proposed algorithm can obtain feasible solutions that meet all constraints and maximize the patrol payoff under the limited resources conditions. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative patrol task planning approach.",Drone,2019
Combined Quaternion-Based Error State Kalman Filtering and Smooth Variable Structure Filtering for Robust Attitude Estimation,"This paper presents a novel robust quaternion-based error state Kalman filter (ESKF) for coping with modeling uncertainty in inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based attitude estimation. The smooth variable structure filter (SVSF) has recently been proposed and proven to be robust to modeling uncertainty. In an effort to combine the accuracy of an ESKF with the robustness of the SVSF, the ESKF and SVSF algorithms have been merged to create the ESKF-SVSF algorithm. In particular, a comprehensive fault detection strategy has been proposed to combine the optimality of the ESKF and the robustness of the SVSF. The proposed ESKF-SVSF algorithm was validated on experimental data collected from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of faulty gyroscope signals. In the experiment, four faulty test cases were considered, involving the injection of two types of faults into the raw gyroscope signals to simulate modeling uncertainty. Although the proposed ESKF-SVSF algorithm incurs a slightly increased computational load, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate attitude estimates than the conventional approach does in the presence of modeling uncertainty.",Drone,2019
Fast Scene Reconstruction Based on Improved SLAM,"Simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) plays the crucial role in VR/AR application, autonomous robotics navigation, UAV remote control, etc. The traditional SLAM is not good at handle the data acquired by camera with fast movement or severe uttering, and the efficiency need to be improved. The paper proposes an improved SLAM algorithm, which mainly improves the real-time performance of classical SLAM algorithm, applies KDtree for efficient organizing feature points, and accelerates the feature points correspondence building. Moreover, the background map reconstruction thread is optimized, the SLAM parallel computation ability is increased. The color images experiments demonstrate that the improved SLAM algorithm holds better real-time performance than the classical SLAM.",Drone,2019
A Novel Improved Bat Algorithm in UAV Path Planning,"Path planning algorithm is the key point to UAV path planning scenario. Many traditional path planning methods still suffer from low convergence rate and insufficient robustness. In this paper, three main methods are contributed to solving these problems. First, the improved artificial potential field (APF) method is adopted to accelerate the convergence process of the bat's position update. Second, the optimal success rate strategy is proposed to improve the adaptive inertia weight of bat algorithm. Third chaos strategy is proposed to avoid falling into a local optimum. Compared with standard APF and chaos strategy in UAV path planning scenarios, the improved algorithm CPFIBA (The improved artificial potential field method combined with chaotic bat algorithm, CPFIBA) significantly increases the success rate of finding suitable planning path and decrease the convergence time. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm also has great robustness for processing with path planning problems. Meanwhile, it overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional meta-heuristic algorithms, as their convergence process is the potential to fall into a local optimum. From the simulation, we can see also obverse that the proposed CPFIBA provides better performance than BA and DEBA in problems of UAV path planning.",Drone,2019
Throughput Improvement for Multi-Hop UAV Relaying,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relaying is one of the main technologies for UAV communications. It uses UAVs as relays in the sky to provide reliable wireless connection between remote users. In this paper, we consider a multi-hop UAV relaying system. To improve the spectrum efficiency of the system, we maximize the average end-to-end throughput from the source to the destination by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocated to each hop, the transmit power for the source and relays, and the trajectories of the UAVs, subject to constraints on the total spectrum bandwidth, the average and peak transmit power, the UAV mobility and collision avoidance, and the information-causality of multi-hop relaying. The formulated optimization is non-convex. We propose an efficient algorithm to approximate and solve it, using the alternating optimization and successive convex optimization methods. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization significantly outperforms other benchmark schemes, verifying the effectiveness of our scheme.",Drone,2019
Nonlinearity-Based Single-Channel Monopulse Tracking Method for OFDM-Aided UAV A2G Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted great interest in rapid deployment for both civilian and military applications. The conventional UAV monopulse tracking technique requires dedicated pulses which suffer from multipath effect in air-to-ground (A2G) link with low elevation angles, whereas the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for A2G high rate communication under frequency selective fading channel was not yet investigated for UAV target tracking at ground station. In this paper, we propose a single-channel monopulse tracking (SCMT) angle estimation method in OFDM tracking receiver exploiting square- and absolute-value nonlinear detection of amplitude-modulated difference signals. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the proposed estimation method in terms of estimation range and estimation root mean squared error (RMSE). Results show that, the proposed angle estimation method exhibits S-shaped curve characteristic under different angle errors, which is insensitive to channels and modulations. The proposed method obtains angle estimation RMSEs smaller than 0.18 degrees for antenna element distance d = 0.5 m with 10 MHz OFDM signals. For both square- and absolute-value methods, a maximum degradation of 0.02 degrees for angle estimation RMSEs is observed under Rician channels compared with the estimation under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, whereas the absolute-value estimation outperforms the square-value estimation.",Drone,2019
Energy-Efficiency Optimization of UAV-Based Cognitive Radio System,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with data transmission and sensing facilities are gaining more popularity in different applications due to its miniaturization and mobility. In this paper, a UAV-based overlay cognitive radio (CR) network is investigated in which the UAV is used as a secondary user (SU). This paper proposes an efficient energy management solution to improve the performance of the UAV. When SUs opportunistically utilize the licensed spectrum of the primary network, spectrum sensing is needed to determine whether to transmit data or not, so the sensing time and secondary transmission power should be jointly optimized. We formulate this non-convex optimization problem subject to multiple constraints, which seeks to investigate on the effect of the sensing time and transmission power on the performance of the system. The problem is difficult to tackle, then we propose an algorithm applying the techniques of alternating optimization and dichotomy method. In addition, we compare the proposed algorithm with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to verify its performance. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the PSO algorithm and significantly enhances the energy efficiency of the UAV-based CR system.",Drone,2019
Finite-Time Control of Multirotor UAVs Under Disturbances,"A new finite-time control method based on a sliding mode for a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed to improve both the transient and steady-state responses, including overshoot and steady-state error in the presence of uncertainties and external disturbances. First, a virtual control with nonlinear sliding manifolds is designed to achieve position-tracking capability, as well as to guarantee the fast convergence of the UAV to a desired position. Furthermore, an ultimate control is developed for the desired attitude-tracking performance. Various uncertainties, including torque due to the discordance between the centre of mass and rotation and wind disturbances are considered. The Lyapunov stability theorem is then applied step-by-step to prove the asymptotically stable and finite-time convergence in position and attitude controllers. Second, the proposed controller is implemented in an open-source hardware platform for a quadrotor UAV. Both numerical and experimental results are compared to validate the tracking performance for attitude and position control, as well as robustness under disturbances.",Drone,2019
STFANET: SDN-Based Topology Management for Flying Ad Hoc Network,"In recent years, with the growth in the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), UAV-based systems have become popular in both military and civil applications. The lack of reliable communication infrastructure in these scenarios has motivated the use of UAVs to establish a network as flying nodes, also known as Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs). However, the high mobility degree of flying and terrestrial users may be responsible for constant changes in the network topology, which makes more challenging to guarantee their communication during the operational time. In this context, this article presents a Software-defined networking (SDN) based Topology management for FANETs - called of STFANET which is a coordination protocol that englobes both an efficient SDN-based UAV communication and a set of topology management algorithms. The goal is to establish and maintain a FANET topology in order to provide a constant and reliable communication link among independent nodes - which are performing individual or collaborative missions - through relays units. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol in order to provide communication in a dynamic scenario. Considering its use in a military setting, STFANET managed to achieve 25% of packet loss in transmitting data packets, 1.5ms of latency and 71% of connectivity on average.",Drone,2019
The Bearing-Only Target localization via the Single UAV: Asymptotically Unbiased Closed-Form Solution and Path Planning,"The target localization based on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is becoming more and more popular due to its flexible mobility. In this paper, the bearing-only localization with respect to the single UAV in the three-dimensional (3D) scenario is studied by the angle of arrival (AOA). In the current researches, the bias of the closed-form solution caused by the coefficient errors of the pseudo-linear equations constructed by the AOA is not effectively eliminated. In order to reduce the bias, an asymptotically unbiased localization algorithm is proposed, which eliminates the bias by constructing the constrained weighted least-squares. Since the term that causes the bias is constrained to a constant, which no longer affects the closed-form solution of the pseudo-linear equations, the closed-form solution is unbiased. After that, the position errors of the UAV are considered in path planning, which improves localization accuracy by taking account of both AOA errors and position errors of the UAV rather than just AOA errors.",Drone,2019
New Bargaining Game Based Computation Offloading Scheme for Flying Ad-hoc Networks,"The past few years have witnessed a tremendous increase on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a wide range of civilian and commercial applications. UAVs are expected to be an important component for 5G and beyond 5G networks. However, there are many challenges associated with the development of UAV networks and applications. In this study, we focus on the heavy computation tasks of UAVs, and design a new and novel task offloading scheme for UAV networks. To achieve the best possible tradeoff between communication delay and computation cost, we adopt the basic concept of (alpha, beta)-bargaining solution, and formulate a cooperative bargaining game model to solve the UAV computation offloading problem. According to the characteristics of (alpha, beta)-bargaining solution, the main advantage of our approach is to provide an axiom-based strategic solution for the task offloading problem while dynamically responding to the current UAV conditions. Extensive simulations are performed in order to confirm the performance superiority of our proposed scheme compared to the existing state-of-the-art protocols. Numerical results show that our approach achieves in average about 10% and 20% better performance results in terms of system throughput, task failure probability, and energy efficiency ratio of UAVs. Finally, a few of open problems are outlined and identified as possible future research directions.",Drone,2019
A Low Profile High Gain Ultra Lightweight Circularly Polarized Annular Ring Slot Antenna for Airborne and Airship Applications,"In this paper a low profile circularly polarized annular ring slot antenna (CPARSA) with high gain is presented. An inverted U-shaped meandered slot is cut at the inner patch of annular ring to obtain the circularly polarized (CP) radiation. This annular slot loaded ground plane on a substrate thickness of 0.5 mm results in a very low profile (0.009 lambda(0)) antenna in term of free space wavelength at its center operating frequency. The largest side lengths of octagonal shaped antenna are 0.89 lambda(0)x0.89 lambda(0) according to its center frequency. Measured impedance bandwidth of 23.54% from 5.4 GHz - 7.0 GHz (for vertical bar S-11 vertical bar <= -10 dB) and AR bandwidth (AR<3dB) of 5.15% from 5.67 GHz - 5.97 GHz are achieved by the antenna. Meanwhile, stable radiation pattern is observed throughout the entire bandwidth with peak gain of 7.6dBi at the center frequency of 5.8 GHz. A defected ground plane is employed in the design which results in reduction of surface waves leading towards higher gain of antenna. The proposed antenna operating at 5.8 GHz band is fabricated on low cost substrate with standard printed circuit board (PCB) process. The proposed design provides favorable characteristics for various lightweight applications including miniaturized drones and airborne applications. To validate the prototype, measured results are compared with simulation outcomes and good agreement is obtained.",Drone,2019
Monocular Vision-Based Obstacle Detection and Avoidance for a Multicopter,"This article presents a monocular vision-based algorithm for detecting obstacles and identifying obstacle-aware regions, developed to be used for collision avoidance by a multicopter. The first step of our algorithm is to predict a disparity image from a single-view image via implementing a deep encoder-decoder network. All pixels in this disparity prediction are then categorized as one of three classes, obstacle, road, or obstacle-free, by combining V-disparity analysis and a fuzzy inference system. For pixels belonging to obstacle objects, obstacle-aware regions are generated within the field of visual perception. To accommodate the safety margins of a multicopter, intermediate way points are then added to obtain a new flyable path that passes through an unknown environment safely. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the detection of obstacles and the identification of obstacle-aware regions. The accuracy of disparity prediction and monocular depth estimation were quantitatively compared to support the feasibility of monocular vision in obstacle avoidance. Furthermore, the entire algorithm was successfully tested on a robotic platform, autonomously flying a hexacopter in an outdoor space with obstacles. In conclusion, the proposed monocular algorithm performs well for obstacle detection and depth estimation and is potentially an alternative to a binocular solution.",Drone,2019
Opportunistic Spectrum Access for UAV Communications Towards Ultra Dense Networks,"The growing popularity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attracts significant research interests and applications including low-altitude and airborne vehicles. Since there is no declared spectrum allocated to UAV communications, opportunistic transmission has been commonly considered as an important way for supporting UAV communications. When sharing the same spectrum with other users such as satellites and mobile base stations, accurate spectrum sensing and allocation are of critical importance for UAV communications to avoid serious interference. As the UAVs can constantly move to different locations with various spectrum environments, the spectrum decision may be invalid only in a short period, leading to require fast spectrum sensing. Furthermore, an UAV needs to predict possible temporal and spatial vacations of the spectrum. In this case, the spectrum prediction has a high dimensional state space which is notoriously difficult to solve. In this paper, some other issues such as how to determine the spectrum processing time and how to detect the primary signals with high priority to avoid interference, are also discussed. Finally, a fast spectrum sensing algorithm is proposed to improve the energy detection performance by optimizing the error estimation and a constant ratio of missed detection. Our proposed algorithm does not require high computational capability and can achieve relatively accurate sensing in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios.",Drone,2019
Simultaneous Robust Control and Sensor Fault Detection for a Ducted Coaxial-Rotor UAV,"This paper addresses the aerodynamic modeling, observer-based state-feedback robust control and sensor fault detection for a laboratory ducted coaxial-rotor UAV (DCUAV). First, by introducing the main model elements of this novel unmanned vehicle, the detailed nonlinear mathematical model of the hovering flight UAV is presented. Second, through introducing a weighting matrix and a new form of change-of-variables, a new method is proposed by designing two different systems simultaneously as detector and controller. An observer-based controller is proposed to achieve the control objective and finite-frequency sensor fault detection objective simultaneously. The observer-based controller design method is derived from a new formulation of linear matrix inequality (LMI), which can achieve the prescribed H-infinity performance, H- performance and the stability of the closed-loop system. By constructing a new matrix decomposition form, the simultaneous design of detector parameters and controller parameters is solved. Finally, simulations are conducted for the hover flight with disturbances and sensor faults, the results show the satisfactory control performance and fault detection performance.",Drone,2019
Robust and Adaptive Backstepping Control for Hexacopter UAVs,"A nonlinear robust and adaptive backstepping control strategy is hierarchically proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem of hexacopter UAVs. Due to the under-actuated and coupled properties of the hexacopter dynamics, the nominal backstepping control approach is fully designed as the main controller. Considering the model uncertainties and external disturbances perturbing the system stability, a robust 2nd-order linear extended state observer (LESO) with more reliable velocity feedback is devised to observe and suppress the instabilities, and peaking phenomena in the observation are removed. Usually, large observer gains are selected to reduce the tracking errors but will amplify the measurement noise. To further enhance the system robustness, an adaptive switching function based compensator is introduced to eliminate the observation errors, through which the requirement on large observer gains is relaxed, and high gain behaviors of the LESO are avoided. Stability analysis proves that the nonlinear control scheme can ensure the hexacopter UAV asymptotic tracking along the designated trajectory. Comparative simulations under different controllers are carried out to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed control scheme.",Drone,2019
Transmitter-Selection Aided Adaptive Consensus-Based Data Sharing for UAV Swarms,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems rely on wireless communications for data sharing and coordination. Recently, both the lazy and eager consensus-based algorithms were proposed to enable swarm-wide data sharing. However, our analysis and experiments show that the performance of both algorithms may degrade drastically in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments. The reason is attributed to the fixed transmitter selection strategies adopted in the algorithms. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptive consensus data sharing algorithm by adopting single best transmitter selection to strike a beneficial tradeoff between convergence rate and payload cost. Then, we propose and implement a UAV swarm simulation platform to facilitate simulations in dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Numerical results reveal that the proposed adaptive consensus-based data sharing algorithm performs well across different network scenarios in terms of convergence rate and payload cost.",Drone,2019
The Obstacle Detection Method of UAV Based on 2D Lidar,"With the widespread use of UAVs in daily life, there are many sensors and algorithms used to ensure flight safety. Among these sensors, lidar has been gradually applied to UAVs due to its stability and portability. However, in the actual application, lidar changes its position with the movement of the UAV, resulting in an offset in the detected point cloud. What's more, when the lidar works, it scatters laser light from the center to the surroundings, which causes the detected point cloud to be externally sparse and dense inside. This point cloud with uneven density is difficult to cluster using common clustering algorithms. In this paper, a velocity estimation method based on the polynomial fit is used to estimate the position of the lidar as it scans each point and then corrects the twisted point cloud. Besides, the clustering algorithm based on relative distance and density (CBRDD) is used to cluster the point cloud with uneven density. To prove the effectiveness of the obstacle detection method, the simulation experiment and actual experiment were carried out. The results show that the method has a good effect on obstacle detection.",Drone,2019
Deployment Optimization of UAV Relays for Collecting Data From Sensors: A Potential Game Approach,"Due to the high maneuverability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a cluster of UAVs is considered used to collect sensing data from the sensors that distributed randomly in an area without the terrestrial infrastructure. The cluster members work as relays to forward the sensing data from sensors to the cluster head. For the reason that the relay deployment impacts the transmission rate and coverage area directly, we are going to optimize the deployment of the UAV relays, aiming to maximize the total capacity of the network. The problem of multi-relay deployment is intractable for two reasons. On one hand, because of the interactional and coupled relationship among the UAV relays, when the deployment of any given relay changes, the deployment optimization of other relays will be affected. On the other hand, on account of that the exact positions of the sensors are unknown, the deployment optimization of the UAV relays cannot be completed directly because of lacking parameters. In order to tackle the coupled relationship among the UAV relays, the problem of multi-relay deployment is modeled as a local interaction game. We prove that the multi-relay deployment game is an exact potential game that has at least one Nash equilibrium (NE) point. Then, the better reply-based relay deployment approach, which is an online learning approach that does not demand the information of the exact positions of sensors, is proposed to search the NE point. The simulation results show that the network capacity is significantly enhanced with the proposed relays deployment approach.",Drone,2019
Numerical Simulation of the Static and Dynamic Aerodynamics of a UAV under Wake Flows,"Frequent flight conflicts will be observed as the number of aircrafts increases, and such conflicts will cause unprecedented challenges in flight safety; thus, the flight characteristics of small aircrafts under the wake flow of a large airliner should be thoroughly analyzed. Combined with the sliding mesh technique, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is proposed in this paper to simulate three wake flow patterns, i.e., wingtip vortex, jet flow, and propeller slipstream, and then, the static and dynamic derivatives that represent the stability of the fly wing under the wake flow are identified by using the least squares method. The results demonstrate that both the steady and unsteady aerodynamics of the fly wing are affected by wake flows: wingtip vortices increase the lift-to-drag ratio and considerably change the dynamic damping; jet flow reduces both the static and dynamic damping; and propeller slipstream leads to slow variations in the dynamic damping and decreases in the lift-to-drag ratio.",Drone,2019
Synthesis of Minimum-Cost Shields for Multi-agent Systems.,"In this paper, we propose a general approach to derive runtime enforcement implementations for multi-agent systems, called shields, from temporal logical specifications. Each agent of the multi-agent system is monitored, and if needed corrected, by the shield, such that a global specification is always satisfied. The different ways of how a shield can interfere with each agent in the system in case of an error introduces the need for quantitative objectives. This work is the first to discuss the shield synthesis problem with quantitative objectives. We provide several cost functions that are utilized in the multi-agent setting and provide methods for the synthesis of cost-optimal shields and fair shields, under the given assumptions on the multi-agent system. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach via a detailed case study on UAV mission planning for warehouse logistics and simulating the shielded multi-agent system on ROS/Gazebo.",Drone,2019
Electromagnetic Signature of a Quadcopter Drone and Its Relationship With Coupling Mechanisms,"This paper presents an investigation of the electromagnetic signature and the coupling mechanism of quadcopter drones with incident electromagnetic (EM) wave and radar cross section (RCS) analysis. Coupling analysis is performed based on the dominant coupling path: when an incident EM wave with a magnitude of 50 kV/m contacts a commercial quadcopter drone, its motor power wires are identified as the dominant coupling path. Higher coupling voltages are obtained for frequencies that have large impedance values at both ends of the load on the motor power wire. This induced voltage can affect the integrated circuit chip on a printed circuit board, as well as parallel plate resonances. Furthermore, the RCS of a quadcopter drone is measured in the frequency range of 0.5-3 GHz. The internal-component vulnerability characteristics of quadcopters can spike at specific frequencies with high RCS values and can be analyzed with or without motor power wires. We verified these hypotheses via 2D inverse synthetic aperture radar images, and we analyzed the results by comparing the empirical and full-wave simulation values.",Drone,2019

The fight against groups of small aircraft in a limited space is one of the problems that have arisen in recent years in relation to the development of small unmanned aerial vehicles.

An Analysis of Increasing Thrust of an Air Propeller Through Additional Lift Surface,"Air propellers used in small scale unmanned aircraft operate at low Reynolds numbers. The aerody-namic force occurring on the blade when the air propeller is in operation is of variable nature. It is observed that for Reynold numbers below 5-105 flow separation can occur on some sections of the propeller surface. To deal with the problem, increase the lift on the blade and therefore, reduce the turbulence boundary level, a new design called bi-blade propeller is developed and patented. This design features an additional blade above the main one. Using ANSYS Fluent, samples of the bi-blade propellers were investigated to determine the positions where the inductive resistence and the turbulence boundary level decreased, and the lift increased when the air propeller was in operation. A comparison study was conducted in laboratory conditions to investigate static thrust of the bi-blade propeller on a test bench at 2000-4500 §Þ§Ú§ß-1. The bi-blade propeller was compared with a conventional propeller.",Drone,2019

Gas dynamic optimization of wedge-shape vaned diffuser of a centrifugal compressor of small-sized turbojet engines based on numerical modeling,"A competitive small-sized turbojet engine development under modern conditions of aviation engines building requires high efficiency values of parts with high degree of pressure ratio. Centrifugal compressors find extensive application while developing small-sized gas turbine engines employed for unmanned aerial vehicles and gas turbine power plants. To ensure high efficiency and compressor pressure ratio, a numerical gas-dynamic calculation is performed with Ansys Workbench (Fluid flow CFX) program, which allows studying the air flow in the diffuser channels. The presented article considers the flow in a wedgeshaped diffuser and optimize geometry optimization of the wedge-shaped diffusers blades of a centrifugal compressor, as well as geometry impact on the total pressure loss coefficient xi and the coefficient of static pressure recovery in the diffuser C<sub>p</sub> at different entry angles alpha<sub>3l</sub>. The main task of the calculation consists in determining the optimal shape of the wedge-shaped diffuser blades, insuring required parameters and characteristics of the diffuser, with an uninterrupted flow and a minimum of energy loss at given input angles. The article presents also the results of the compressor stage numerical study, i.e. joint operation of the impeller with a diffuser to assess the quality of the geometry and operation of the diffuser to increase the compressor efficiency. In the presented work, the calculation model is built with the SolidWorks program, and then, using the Turbo Grid program, the computational grid was applied. The flow simulation was performed using the SST turbulent viscosity model.",Drone,2019
Diffusion and policy transfer in armed UAV proliferation: the cases of Italy and Germany,"In a 2015 policy change, the U.S. State Department released guidelines governing the sale of armed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to other countries, and several export agreements were signed shortly later. While considerable scholarly effort has been devoted to the impact or consequences of UAV proliferation, few studies have analyzed the actual diffusion process. This article applies the insights from both diffusion theory and policy transfer to examine the various diffusion mechanisms while using the experiences from Italy and Germany to illustrate distinct cases policy convergence and divergence, respectively. While the competition mechanism is typically constrained to policy adopting jurisdictions, evidence on armed UAV diffusion suggests policy transfer decisions can also hinge on competition among exporting jurisdictions. Consequently, we seek to point attention to the interaction between diffusion mechanisms (such as competition) and various domestic conditions, demonstrating that diffusion is neither apolitical nor necessarily neutral in character.",Drone,2019
Reliability Assessment of Flexible InGaP/GaAs Double-Junction Solar Module Using Experimental and Numerical Analysis,"Flexible solar cells have attracted enormous attention in recent years due to their wide applications such as portable batteries, wearable devices, robotics, drones, and airplanes. In particular, the demands of the flexible silicon and compound semiconductor solar cells with high efficiency and high reliability keep increasing. In this study, we fabricated a flexible InGaP/GaAs double-junction solar module. Then, the effects of the wind speed and ambient temperature on the operating temperature of the solar cell were analyzed with the numerical simulation. The temperature distributions of the solar modules were analyzed for three different wind speeds of 0 m/s, 2.5 m/s, and 5 m/s, and two different ambient temperature conditions of 25oC and 33oC. The flexibility of the flexible solar module was also evaluated with the bending tests and numerical bending simulation. When the wind speed was 0 m/s at 25 oC, the maximum temperature of the solar cell was reached to be 149.7oC. When the wind speed was increased to 2.5 m/s, the temperature of the solar cell was reduced to 66.2oC. In case of the wind speed of 5 m/s, the temperature of the solar cell dropped sharply to 48.3oC. Ambient temperature also influenced the operating temperature of the solar cell. When the ambient temperature increased to 33oC at 2.5 m/s, the temperature of the solar cell slightly increased to 74.2oC indicating that the most important parameter affecting the temperature of the solar cell was heat dissipation due to wind speed. Since the maximum temperatures of the solar cell are lower than the glass transition temperatures of the materials used, the chances of thermal deformation and degradation of the module will be very low. The flexible solar module can be bent to a bending radius of 7 mm showing relatively good bending capability. Neutral plane analysis was also indicated that the flexibility of the solar module can be further improved by locating the solar cell in the neutral plane.",Drone,2019

To increase face recognition ratio of certain person from real-time drone images, it uses Deep Learning-based facial recognition algorithm and uses the principle of Triples in particular. To check the performance of the system, the results of 30 experiments for face recognition based on the author's face showed a recognition rate of about 95% or higher. It is believed that research results of this paper can be used to quickly find specific person through drone at tourist sites and festival venues.",Drone,2019
alance Control of Drone using Adaptive Two-Track Control,"The flight controller(FC) used in small-sized drone was developed as simple structure does not perform complex operations because it uses different MCU with large-sized drone. Also, the balance control of small-sized drone should be simpler than Kalman filter using complex filter and the method using Complementary filter has relatively more operations. So, the method to realize the balance control on small-sized drone effectively using two-track control operating as proper method for above is suggested in this research. This method is a system maintaining effective balance with simple structure and less operations by operating adaptively for the unbalance of the drone with the acceleration sensor with the advantage which performing accurate correction by data processing for long term change and gyroscope sensor maintaining the balance of the drone by data processing for short term change. It is confirmed that stable operation was performed mostly based on the test result for repeatable test more than 100 times using two-track control and it maintained normal state operation more than 98% excluding the difficulty of maintaining normal operation when meets sudden and rapid wind yet.",Drone,2019
A New CSR-DCF Tracking Algorithm based on Faster RCNN Detection Model and CSRT Tracker for Drone Data,"Nowadays object tracking process becoming one of the most challenging task in Computer Vision filed. A CSR-DCF (channel spatial reliability-discriminative correlation filter) tracking algorithm have been proposed on recent tracking benchmark that could achieve stat-of-the-art performance where channel spatial reliability concepts to DCF tracking and provide a novel learning algorithm for its efficient and seamless integration in the filter update and the tracking process with only two simple standard features, HoGs and Color names. However, there are some cases where this method cannot track properly, like overlapping, occlusions, motion blur, changing appearance, environmental variations and so on. To overcome that kind of complications a new modified version of CSR-DCF algorithm has been proposed by integrating deep learning based object detection and CSRT tracker which implemented in OpenCV library. As an object detection model, according to the comparable result of object detection methods and by reason of high efficiency and celerity of Faster RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) has been used, and combined with CSRT tracker, which demonstrated outstanding real-time detection and tracking performance. The results indicate that the trained object detection model integration with tracking algorithm gives better outcomes rather than using tracking algorithm or filter itself.",Drone,2019
"Development of Anti-drone, Origin Tracking System against Drones¡® Attack","Drones, mainly used for military reconnaissance, have recently been employed for broader range of purposes including agricultural, video and photographic recording, rescue missions, and leisure sports. While the larger supply of drones are proving to have its own benefits, but some drones are used in crimes such as terrorism, drug-trafficking, and invasion of personal privacy. Therefore, various types of anti-drones are emerging to defend against drones used with ill intent. However, there is a limitation in tracking back to the drones¡¯ operator. Especially, it is not easy to find the criminals if they cause damage to people and property of major facilities and largely populated facilities. Also, should a drone approaching dangerous and limited areas be shot down, there is a risk of releasing hazardous materials(explosives, poisonous chemical solutions etc.) the drone is carrying, causing damage to the area. It is necessary to prevent such crime scenes from occurring by finding ways to trace the drone to a safe zone or back to the drone operator.",Drone,2019
A Study on Standardization on the Flight Controller Mode in Remotely Piloted Aircraft Drone : Focused on Drone Controller Mode Preference,"Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) controls as a type of unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) is growing rapidly and its flight controller stick disposition is required standardization. We should standardize RPA drone flight control disposition because the flight pilot of RPA is hard to be trained so the flight controller stick differences impairs safety and wastes time and effort of flight controller industry. So this study researches the on-going standardization of RPA drone flight control disposition in Korea and foreign countries. Also this paper analyzes and researches of expert about RPA drone flight controller function and application of flight control mode. I accomplished expert research about standardization plan of unmanned flight control mode and confirm the necessity. Nowadays mode1 and 2 are mostly used in Korea so I carried out preference investigation for two modes. There were 4 preferences choices of RPA drone control mode necessity (importance) and recommendation of standardization modes. They answered that necessity of standardization is important considering pilot training, flight safety and positive development of drone industry. The result of standardization mode preference is that they prefer mode 2 (drone maker 86%, training facilities and research facilities 58%, government bureau 60%). Overall preference result shows that mode 1 24%, mode 1&2 16%, mode 2 60%. So they preferred mode 2 by 60%. The differences between two modes are the direction of throttle and pitch. Direction of throttle and pitch operate opposite way. They prefer mode 2 because mode 2 has similarities of manned flight control mode. Significance of this study is that it showed the necessity of standardization and flight control preference in a quantitative way. It will help drone standardization in related industries and development direction near future.",Drone,2019
Automatic Registration of Point Cloud Data between MMS and UAV using ICP Method,"3D geo-spatial model have been widely used in the field of Civil Engineering, Medical,Computer Graphics, Urban Management and many other. Especially, the demand for high quality 3D spatial information such as precise road map construction has explosivelyincreased, MMS and UAV techniques have been actively used to acquire them moreeasily and conveniently in surveying and geo-spatial field. However, in order to perform3D modeling by integrating the two data set from MMS and UAV, its so needed anproper registration method is required to efficiently correct the difference between theraw data acquisition sensor, the point cloud data generation method, and the observationaccuracy occurred when the two techniques are applied. In this study, we obtained UAVpoint colud data in Yeouido area as the study area in order to determine the automaticregistration performance between MMS and UAV point cloud data using ICP(IterativeCloset Point) method. MMS observations was then performed in the study area bydividing 4 zones according to the level of overlap ratio and observation noise with basedon UAV data. After we manually registered the MMS data to the UAV data, thencompared the results which automatic registered using ICP method. In conclusion, thehigher the overlap ratio and the lower the noise level, can bring the more accurateresults in the automatic registration using ICP method.",Drone,2019
Structural Analysis and Integrity Verification of Main Wing of HALE UAV,"Recently, development of long endurance electric powered airplane has been conductedworldwidely. Light structural weight of a main wing with sufficient structural integrity isessential for long endurance flight. Since a main wing with a slender spar can occurcatastrophic fracture under the flight, it is important to establish a design and verificationmethod for both the weight reduction and structural integrity. In this paper, structuraldesign and analysis of the main wing of HALE UAV with tubular spar reinforced with abulkhead were introduced. The static strength test of the main wing was performed toverify structural integrity under the static load. Then, the experimental result was comparedwith an analytical result from a finite element analysis.

A Study on the Radar Data Analysis of VFR Aircraft at an Airport,"Obstacle limitation surfaces are imaginary space surfaces that must be clear of obstaclesfor the aircraft to safely take off and land on the aerodrome. These surfaces are closelyrelated to the safety of the VFR aircraft, which require a pilot to be able to see outside thecockpit, to control the aircraft's altitude, navigate, and avoid obstacles and other aircraft. TheRepublic of Korea, which has a lot of restrictions on the use of airspace, cannot provide arich operating environment for VFR aircraft. Under these circumstances, safer operation willnot be guaranteed if additional factors that directly or indirectly affect existing VFR routes,such as drone delivery services. This study analyzes and models the track distribution ofeach VFR section based on radar track data around a specific airport. Through this study,we estimate the three-dimensional space for VFR aircraft and provide the data for futureresearch such as airspace analysis of VFR corridors and correlation with obstacle limitationsurfaces.",Drone,2019
Feature-based Matching Algorithms for Registration between LiDAR Point Cloud Intensity Data Acquired from MMS and Image Data from UAV,"Recently, as the demand for 3D geospatial information increases, the importance of rapid and accurate data construction has increased. Although many studies have been conducted to register UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imagery based on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, which is capable of precise 3D data construction, studies using LiDAR data embedded in MMS (Mobile Mapping System) are insufficient. Therefore, this study compared and analyzed 9 matching algorithms based on feature points for registering reflectance image converted from LiDAR point cloud intensity data acquired from MMS with image data from UAV. Our results indicated that when the SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm was applied, it was able to stable secure a high matching accuracy, and it was confirmed that sufficient conjugate points were extracted even in various road environments. For the registration accuracy analysis, the SIFT algorithm was able to secure the accuracy at about 10 pixels except the case when the overlapping area is low and the same pattern is repeated. This is a reasonable result considering that the distortion of the UAV altitude is included at the time of UAV image capturing. Therefore, the results of this study are expected to be used as a basic research for 3D registration of LiDAR point cloud intensity data and UAV imagery.",Drone,2019
Normalized Digital Surface Model Extraction and Slope Parameter Determination through Region Growing of UAV Data,"NDSM (Normalized Digital Surface Model) is key information for the detailed analysis of remote sensing data. Although NDSM can be simply obtained by subtracting a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) from a DSM (Digital Surface Model), in case of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data, it is difficult to get an accurate DTM due to high resolution characteristics of UAV data containing a large number of complex objects on the ground such as vegetation and urban structures. In this study, RGB-based UAV vegetation index, ExG (Excess Green) was used to extract initial seed points having low ExG values for region growing such that a DTM can be generated cost-effectively based on high resolution UAV data. For this process, local window analysis was applied to resolve the problem of erroneous seed point extraction from local low ExG points. Using the DSM values of seed points, region growing was applied to merge neighboring terrain pixels. Slope criteria were adopted for the region growing process and the seed points were determined as terrain points in case the size of segments is larger than 0.25 m2. Various slope criteria were tested to derive the optimized value for UAV data-based NDSM generation. Finally, the extracted terrain points were evaluated and interpolation was performed using the terrain points to generate an NDSM. The proposed method was applied to agricultural area in order to extract the above ground heights of crops and check feasibility of agricultural monitoring.",Drone,2019
Analysis of Three Dimensional Positioning Accuracy of Vectorization Using UAV-Photogrammetry,"There are two feature collection methods in digital mapping using the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) Photogrammetry: vectorization and stereo plotting. In vectorization, planar information is extracted from orthomosaics and elevation value obtained from a DSM (Digital Surface Model) or a DEM (Digital Elevation Model). However, the exact determination of the positional accuracy of 3D features such as ground facilities and buildings is very ambiguous, because the accuracy of vectorizing results has been mainly analyzed using only check points placed on the ground. Thus, this study aims to review the possibility of 3D spatial information acquisition and digital map production of vectorization by analyzing the corner point coordinates of different layers as well as check points. To this end, images were taken by a Phantom 4 (DJI) with 3.6 cm of GSD (Ground Sample Distance) at altitude of 90 m. The outcomes indicate that the horizontal RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of vectorization method is 0.045 cm, which was calculated from residuals at check point compared with those of the field survey results. It is therefore possible to produce a digital topographic (plane) map of 1:1,000 scale using ortho images. On the other hand, the three-dimensional accuracy of vectorization was 0.068~0.162 m in horizontal and 0.090~1.840 m in vertical RMSE. It is thus difficult to obtain 3D spatial information and 1:1,000 digital map production by using vectorization due to a large error in elevation.",Drone,2019
Dynamic Stability of Particle-Lattice Structures Simulating Swarms in Turbulence,"The dynamic stability of swarms is crucial in preventing collisions in clustered flights and safely moving along a defined path. Although there have been many simulation studies on dynamic stability, there have not been many experimental studies using real clusters due to the difficulty in implementation.

We identified a criterion that describes dynamically stable particle-lattice structures. The stability increased as this newly defined spatial index increased.",Drone,2019

Improving Wind Speed Forecasts Using Deep Neural Network,"Wind speed data constitute important weather information for aircrafts flying at low altitudes, such as drones. Currently, the accuracy of low altitude wind predictions is much lower than that of high-altitude wind predictions.

Deep neural networks mimic the learning process of the interactions among neurons in the brain, and it is used in various fields, such as recognition of image, sound, and texts, image and natural language processing, and pattern recognition in time-series. In this study, the deep neural network model is constructed using the wind prediction values generated by the numerical model as an input to improve the wind speed forecasts.

The experiment conducted for 1 month in April 2018. As a result, the RUC-YSU physical process combination using the GFS initial data showed the best performance.

Analysis of Radio Distortion in Navigational Aid using Drone,"To overcome the limitation of ground inspection for Navigational Aid, Korea Airport Corporation (KAC) developed a drone system for Navigational Aid inspection. This drone system has the advantage that they can inspect the air radio signal at the perspective of user (aircraft). Since drones have more free flight paths and easier control of flight speeds compared to aircrafts, drones can check sections of suspected airborne radio wave distortions at desired paths and speeds. Recently, with the acceleration of the development around the airport, there is a concern about the deterioration of the quality of radio signal of Navigational Aid. In order to analyze radio distortion of Navigational Aid, a radio wave environmental survey was conducted using drones. When the signal received by each flight path of the drone was measured, the origin of the reflected wave was identified by analyzing the section in which the radio signal was distorted.",Drone,2019
Real-time Tele-operated Drone System with LTE Communication,"In this research, we suggest a real-time tele-driving system for unmanned drone operations using the LTE communication system. The drone operator is located 180km away and controls the altitude and position of the drone with a 50ms time delay. The motion data and video from the drone is streamed to the operator. The video is played on the operator¡¯s head-mounted display (HMD) and the motion data emulates the drone on the simulator for the operator. In general, a drone is operated using RF signal and the maximum distance for direct control is limited to 2km. For long range drone control over 2km, an auto flying mode is enabled using a mission plan along with GPS data. In an emergency situation, the autopilot is stopped and the ¡°return home¡± function is executed.

A Study on Routing Protocol for Multi-Drone Communication,"In this paper, it is necessary to study the bandwidth and network system for efficient image transmission in the current era of drone imaging, and to design routing protocols to round out and cluster two or more multi-drones. First, we want to construct an ad hoc network to control the multidrone. Several studies are underway for the clustering of drones. The aircraft ad hoc network (FANET) is an important foundation for this research. A number of routing protocols have been proposed to design a FANET, and these routing protocols show different performances in various situations and environments. The routing protocol used to design the FANET is tested using the routing protocol used in the existing mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Therefore, we will use MANET to simulate the routing protocol to be used in the FANET, helping to select the optimal routing protocol for future FANET design. Finally, this paper describes the routing protocols that are mainly used in MANET and suitable for FANET, and the performance comparison of routing protocols, which are mainly used in FANET design.",Drone,2019

Photogrammetric intersection. Accuracy estimation for an arbitrary case of aerial survey,"An approach to solving the problem of estimating the accuracy of a photogrammetric intersection for an arbitrary case of aerial survey is considered. Analytical formulae are obtained for calculating the errors of the spatial coordinates for any values of the elements of the exterior and interior orientation of the imaging camera. The parameters of the model are: elements of external, internal orientation, coordinates of images. Analytical formulae allow calculating the contribution of the error of any parameter of the model to the accuracy of the spatial coordinates. The problem is solved for the second Euler angle system (a, §ð, x): a - the longitudinal angle of inclination, §ð - transverse angle of inclination, x - the angle of rotation. The solution is found with respect to the center of the projection of the left image of the stereo pair. Four variants of calculation of the parallactic coefficient are used. For the case when the direction of the survey basis is arbitrary relative to the coordinate system, as well as for the cases when the survey basis is located along one of the axes of the coordinate system are considered while performing the calculations. The numerical experiment demonstrates the application of the obtained formulae. The importance of the matter, in particular, is due to the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV).",Drone,2019
The experience of using unmanned aerial vehicles to create a cartographic basis for GIS of roads,"The presented work describes the possibility of using UAVs to create a cartographic basis of roads for inventory, monitoring purposes and management decisions with the accuracy required. This work considers steps of making an orthophotoplan based on the data obtained by UAVs. The technical characteristics of the work are given and the accuracy of the data is estimated.

Strobing of Radar Marks for Trajectory Filtration in a Body-Fixed Frame,"Introduction. Modern air targets, particularly drones, are becoming less noticeable, while their manoeuvrability continues to improve. Trajectory processing algorithms have also been improved in order to provide for effective tracking of highly manoeuvring targets. The accuracy of filtering trajectory parameters is largely determined by the reliability of radar information. This has also required an enhanced role for strobe algorithms and the need to increase the effectiveness of strobe radar marks.Aim. To develop and investigate the efficiency of a trajectory strobe algorithm based on the target motion model in a high-speed coordinate system associated with the direction of the target motion and involving the formation of a strobe in the form of a truncated elliptical sector.Materials and methods. The study considered the target motion model in the body-fixed frame. This model was taken as the basis for new trajectory filtering algorithms based on Kalman filtering. Existing methods for strobing radar marks of the target were considered and a new approach based on filtering in the body-fixed frame proposed. The new algorithm assumes the formation of a strobe in the form of a truncated elliptical sector. This form corresponds to the most probable location of the marks of the tracked target. The effectiveness of the proposed solutions is confirmed by the results of mathematical modelling carried out using MATLAB.Results. The study produced analytical expressions for the motion model, recurrent filtering and strobe algorithm in the body-fixed frame. A comparative analysis of tracking effectiveness with the same volumes of the elliptical and proposed strobes was performed. It was established that the algorithm with strobe formation in the shape of a truncated elliptical sector provides for longer target tracking up to the time of the first loss of the mark for speed and highly manoeuvring targets, when compared to the elliptical strobe algorithm. In addition, the average duration of sector strobe tracking does not in practice depend on the initial speed of the target and provides greater accuracy for small measurement error values (less than 50 m) of the coordinates than in comparison with the elliptical one. Conclusion. The described results were achieved by the ability of the strobe in the body-fixed frame to adapt to the direction of motion and target manoeuvring, allowing high-quality target tracking within a larger speed range. Such strobe formation will also reduce the likelihood of skip-ping radar marks from the tracked target and will reduce the number of false marks belonging to other trajectories inside the strobe.",Drone,2019
Construction of 3D Spatial Information of Vertical Structure by Combining UAS and Terrestrial LiDAR,"Recently, as a part of the production of spatial information by smart cities, three-dimensional reproduction of structures for reverse engineering has been attracting attention. In particular, terrestrial LiDAR is mainly used for 3D reproduction of structures, and 3D reproduction research by UAS has been actively conducted. However, both technologies produce blind spots due to the shooting angle. This study deals with vertical structures. 3D model implemented through SfM- based image analysis technology using UAS and reproducibility and effectiveness of 3D models by terrestrial LiDAR-based laser scanning are examined. In addition, two 3D models are merged and reviewed to complement the blind spot. For this purpose, UAS based image is acquired for artificial rock wall, VCP and check point are set through GNSS equipment and total station, and 3D model of structure is reproduced by using SfM based image analysis technology. In addition, Through 3D LiDAR scanning, the 3D point cloud of the structure was acquired, and the accuracy of reproduction and completeness of the 3D model based on the checkpoint were compared and reviewed with the UAS-based image analysis results. In particular, accuracy and realistic reproducibility were verified through a combination of point cloud constructed from UAS and terrestrial LiDAR. The results show that UAS ¨C based image analysis is superior in accuracy and 3D model completeness and It is confirmed that accuracy improves with the combination of two methods. As a result of this study, it is expected that UAS and terrestrial LiDAR laser scanning combination can complement and reproduce precise three-dimensional model of vertical structure, so it can be effectively used for spatial information construction, safety diagnosis and maintenance management.",Drone,2019

Study for Fan-in-Wing UAV Flow Characteristics,"In this paper, computational analysis was carried out using a model equipped with a lift fan with the same thrust as the maximum take-off weight of the RC aircraft using the Onera M6 wing. Freestream velocity and angle of attack were used as variables to analyze the pressure distribution of the wing surface and the flow characteristics. Fan-in-Wing analysis showed that the vertical take-off and landing functions were highlighted at 3m/s and the lift coefficient of Fan-in-Wing at this time was about 14% higher than the Onera M6. In conclusion, when the Onera M6 wing was equipped with a lift fan with the same thrust as the maximum take-off weight of the RC airplane, it showed better performance in terms of lift coefficient in low-speed flight where vertical take-off and landing performance was more pronounced than high-speed flight. Therefore, when there is not enough take-off space and must meet low-speed flight condition, it is considered suitable to use Fan-in-Wing.",Drone,2019
Sound Levels from Variable Shapes of a Tactical UAV Propeller,"Sound levels from the propeller of a tactical unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were computed using an acoustic analogy.

The blade geometry, pressure distribution on the blade surface, and operating conditions were used as input data for the thickness and loading noise analyses. A change of blade shape was adopted to investigate noise signals from the UAV propeller. Noise prediction for three rotating blade speeds (tip mach numbers of 0.4, 0.8, and 0.95) from the UH-1H rotor with and without the swept tip was also carried out, respectively. It was determined that meaningful noise level reduction cannot be expected except in the case of Mach number of 0.95. Sound levels generated from three different shapes, straight, forward-curved, and backward-curved blade shapes, were compared with each other with various tip Mach numbers.",Drone,2019

Comparison of Digital Maps Created by Stereo Plotting and Vectorization Based on Images Acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming an economical and efficient means to create digital maps, but until now, the vectorization method has been used to extract topographic features from orthoimages for large-scale mapping. The aim of this study is to determine the potential of UAV photogrammetry for digital mapping with stereo plotting, which can include vertical position information. In this study, the entire work process of UAV photogrammetry was performed using a case study in Korea, where 314 images were acquired with a BirdsEyeView Aerobotics FireFly6 PRO. To compare the results, digital maps were created by stereo plotting and vectorization. To evaluate the accuracy of the digital maps created by stereo plotting, we evaluated the accuracy of the aerial triangulation (AT) work from ground control points (GCPs) and the position accuracy of the maps from checkpoints (CPs). The accuracy of the AT work was on the sub-centimeter order and the position accuracy of the maps was on the sub-decimeter order. We also compared a digital map produced by the Korean National Geographic Information Institute (NGII) with the maps created by stereo plotting and vectorization to evaluate the mapping accuracy. From the results of the comparison, we found that the maps created by stereo plotting were more accurate than those created by vectorization.",Drone,2019
3D Grid-based Global Positioning System Satellite Signal Shadowing Range Modeling in Urban Area,"In urban environments, the location accuracy of autonomous vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using navigation systems may be degraded because the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy is degraded owing to satellite visibility or multipath signals. Therefore, to ensure the safety of autonomous navigation systems, we need technologies that can recognize or predict changes in the GNSS observation environment when vehicles enter areas with severe reception conditions. In this study, we developed an algorithm determining the GPS signal shadowing range that can be blocked by nearby obstacles at a specific grid point. To evaluate the algorithm, we collected GPS signals in the test area and analyzed the signal characteristics by overlapping the satellite trajectory and satellite signal shadowing area modeling results. As a result of the experiment, GPS signals were received in the satellite invisible area owing to the multipath effect, but the data continuity was reduced in the corresponding satellites, and L2 signals were disconnected or the amplitude of the vibration of MP1 was significantly larger than that of the visible satellites. Therefore, the SEM generation algorithm is expected to improve the positioning accuracy of autonomous navigation systems by removing multipath signals and simulating the observation environment of the GNSS receiver.",Drone,2019
SE and EE Optimization for Cognitive UAV Network Based on Location Information,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) aided communication has the potential to provide on-demand wireless services and improve the outdoor link throughput. Applications for UAVs are rapidly growing with the development of Internet of Things. Because of limited battery energy, the UAVs need time-limited spectrum access to complete data transmission. Hence there are two challenges for the UAV-based communication: 1) Spectrum-efficient design; 2) Energy-efficient design. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of spectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) for cognitive UAV network based on location information. Because of high mobility, the cognitive radio (CR) based UAVs operate on different frequency bands that vary with time and space. Thus, one spectrum band that is available in one region may not be necessarily available in another region. Based on location information of the primary transmitter and the UAV, we propose a hybrid mode in which the sensing performance and UAVs transmit power can be adjusted simultaneously to satisfy the outage constraint of the primary user. The multi-objective optimization theory is used to solve the tradeoff between SE and EE. The UAVs transmit power, sensing time and sensing threshold are optimized jointly to solve the tradeoff problem. To further improve the SE and EE performance, we propose a multi-frame combined sensing scheme, in which multiple frames are bundled together. Simulation results are provided to show the SE-EE tradeoff design, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid mode, and to show the advantages of the multi-frame combined sensing scheme in EE performance.",Drone,2019
Automated Coregistration of Multisensor Orthophotos Generated from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Platforms,"Image coregistration is a key preprocessing step to ensure the effective application of very-high-resolution (VHR) orthophotos generated from multisensor images acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. The most accurate method to align an orthophoto is the installation of air-photo targets at a test site prior to flight image acquisition, and these targets were used as ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing and georectification. However, there are time and cost limitations related to installing the targets and conducting field surveys on the targets during every flight. To address this problem, this paper presents an automated coregistration approach for orthophotos generated from VHR images acquired from multisensors mounted on UAV platforms. Spatial information from the orthophotos, provided by the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) at each image's acquisition time, is used as ancillary information for phase correlation-based coregistration. A transformation function between the multisensor orthophotos is then estimated based on conjugate points (CPs), which are locally extracted over orthophotos using the phase correlation approach. Two multisensor datasets are constructed to evaluate the proposed approach. These visual and quantitative evaluations confirm the superiority of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
UAV Swarm-Enabled Aerial CoMP: A Physical Layer Security Perspective,"Unlike aerial base station enabled by a single unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial coordinated multiple points (CoMP) can be enabled by a UAV swarm. In this case, the management of multiple UAVs is important. This paper considers the power allocation strategy for a UAV swarm-enabled aerial network to enhance the physical layer security of the downlink transmission, where an eavesdropper moves following the trajectory of the swarm for better eavesdropping. Unlike existing works, we use only the large-scale channel state information (CSI) and maximize the secrecy throughput in a whole-trajectory-oriented manner. The overall transmission energy constraint on each UAV and the total transmission duration for all the legitimate users are considered. The non-convexity of the formulated problem is solved by using max-min optimization with iteration. Both the transmission power of desired signals and artificial noise (AN) are derived iteratively. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed power allocation algorithm and to show the advantage of aerial CoMP by using only the large-scale CSI.",Drone,2019
"On-Line Obstacle Detection, Avoidance, and Mapping of an Outdoor Quadrotor Using EKF-Based Fuzzy Tracking Incremental Control","The unknown two-dimensional obstacles, including different shapes, numbers, locations, and in the vicinity of the planning path for an outdoor quadrotor, are on-line detected by a 360-degree Li-Dar Sweep Scanse. Based on the comparison among detected triangles containing extreme points of each obstacle, the central orientation of the triangle with the maximum detected distance and the angle larger than the specific threshold is assigned to fly a specific distance for obstacle avoidance. Nevertheless, the quadrotor probably encounters a dead end and is then navigated to a specific altitude for the continuous procedure of obstacle detection. By on-line detection at different waypoints for the same obstacle, an obstacle mapping is also established by all the obstacle detections. Since the sensing signals of an outdoor quadrotor are easily affected by stochastic noise and the quadrotor is operated in x configuration, an extended Kalman filter based fuzzy tracking incremental control (EKF-FTIC) is employed to simultaneously execute the path tracking, obstacle avoidance, and target approach. Finally, the experiments with 5 unknown obstacles in the neighborhood of a planning path connecting start point with end point validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
On the Application of Directional Antennas in Multi-Tier Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"This paper evaluates the performance of downlink information transmission in three-dimensional (3D) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, where multi-tier UAVs of different types and flying altitudes employ directional antennas for communication with ground user equipments (UEs). We introduce a novel tractable antenna gain model, which is a nonlinear function of the elevation angle and the directivity factor, for directional antenna-based UAV communication. Since the transmission range of a UAV is limited by its antenna gain and the receiving threshold of the UEs, only UAVs located in a finite region in each tier can successfully communicate with the UEs. The communication connectivity, association probability as well as coverage probability of the considered multi-tier UAV networks are derived for both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation scenarios. Our analytical results unveil that, for UAV networks employing directional antennas, a necessary tradeoff between connectivity and coverage probability exists. Consequently, UAVs flying at low altitudes require a large elevation angle in order to successfully serve the ground UEs. Moreover, by employing directional antennas an optimal directivity factor exists for maximizing the coverage probability of the multi-tier UAV networks. Simulation results validate the analytical derivations and suggest the application of high-gain directional antennas to improve downlink transmission in the multi-tier UAV networks.",Drone,2019

Examples are manufacturing plants, drone swarms, and autonomous connected cars. These systems belong to the category of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where the physical components interact with the digital world. Designing and managing CPS safely and securely is extremely difficult given their heterogeneity, i.e., the presence of multiple physical and logical domains, and their scale, i.e., number of components and of interconnections. To cope with these difficulties, mathematical approaches have been proposed but few if any can deal with all the above mentioned challenges.

People dont get to visit his/her loved ones grave due to lack of time, busy schedule or traffic congestion. Visiting of graveyard is unfriendly for elderly too because of their health issues. Today, by the coordination of developed sensor and IT innovation, visiting of graveyard has become simple.

Deep Attention Neural Network for Multi-Label Classification in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery,"The multi-label classification problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images is particularly challenging compared to single-label classification due to its combinatorial nature. To tackle this issue, we propose in this paper a deep learning approach based on encoder-decoder neural network architecture with channel and spatial attention mechanisms. Specifically, the encoder module which is based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) has the task to transform the input image to a set of feature maps using an opportune feature combination. To improve the feature representation further, this module incorporates a squeeze excitation (SE) layer for modelling the interdependencies between the channels of the feature maps. The decoder module which is based on a long short terms memory (LSTM) network has the task of generating, in a sequential way, the classes present in the image. At each time step, it predicts the next class-label by aligning its hidden state to the corresponding region in the image by means of an adaptive spatial attention mechanism. The experiments carried out on two UAV datasets with a spatial resolution of 2-cm show that our method is promising in predicting the labels present in the image while attending the relevant objects in the image. Additionally, it is able to provide better classification results compared to state-of-the-art methods.",Drone,2019
PSO-Based Agent Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks,"Secondary users (SUs) can detect the states of primary users (PUs) and access the idle spectrum in an opportunistic way in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). With the spread of wireless communication devices, the mobility of both PUs and SUs is ubiquitous. To obtain more accurate spectrum sensing data, SUs must be located within the transmission range of PUs. With the unknown mobility, it is difficult to guarantee the efficiency of spectrum sensing. Focused on this issue, we propose a new scheme, called Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) -based agent cooperative spectrum sensing (PSOA) in this paper. In this scheme, we deploy multiple mobile agents spreading over the network, to cooperate in spectrum sensing instead of SUs. All agents will move according to the latest global optimal agents of the corresponding target PUs with the fitness function calculated by modified PSO. With the optimal movement, the distribution of agents can guarantee that most PUs are within the detection coverage of PSOA. The evaluation results show that our scheme can save over 80 of sensing time and over 80 of energy consumption (affected by the agents number and max velocity) than the active searching scheme. PSOA also guarantees the sensing probability of 80 and higher in our simulation.",Drone,2019
Fast and Refined Processing of Radar Maneuvering Target Based on Hierarchical Detection via Sparse Fractional Representation,"Reliable and fast detection of maneuvering target in complex background is important for both civilian and military applications. It is rather difficult due to the complex motion resulting in energy spread in time and frequency domain. Also, high detection performance and computational efficiency are difficult to balance in case of more pulses. In this paper, we propose a fast and refined processing method of radar maneuvering target based on hierarchical detection, utilizing the advantages of moving target detection (MTD), and the proposed sparse fractional representation. The method adopts two-stage threshold processing. The first stage is the coarse detection processing screening out the rangebins with possible moving targets. The second stage is called the refined processing, which uses robust sparse fractional Fourier transform (RSFRFT) or robust sparse fractional ambiguity function (RSFRAF) dealing with high-order motions, i.e., accelerated or jerk motion. And the second stage is carried out only within the rangebins after the first stage. Therefore, the amount of calculation can be greatly reduced while ensuring high detection performance. Finally, real radar experiment of UAV target detection is carried out for verification of the proposed method, which shows better performance than the traditional MTD method, and the FRFT-FRAF hierarchical coherent integration detection with less computational burden.",Drone,2019
Joint Resource Allocation and Trajectory Control for UAV-Enabled Vehicular Communications,"In this paper, aiming at the emergency coverage for vehicular network, we consider the problem of resource allocation for unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) enabled vehicular communications, where UAV work as a temporary cellular base station. Our objective is to maximize the sum achievable rate of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and ensure the reliability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications by dynamic coverage provided by UAV. Firstly, through theoretical analysis, optimal transmission power expressions for cellular users (CUEs) and device-to-device users (DUEs) are given, respectively. Secondly, by utilizing 3-partite graph matching and Hungarian algorithm, we present two graph-based methods for spectrum sharing and resource block assignment of UAV enabled vehicular network. Moreover, considering the mobility of UAV, we adopt the Q-Learning algorithm to control the trajectory of UAV in order to adapt to the time-varying channel. Finally, the feasibility of the presented schemes are verified by simulation and compared to randomized matching scheme. The simulation results show that the sum achievable rate of V2I links increases with the increase of the maximum transmission power of CUEs and the interruption probability of V2V links, and decreases with the increase of the ratio of DUEs to CUEs and the minimum capacity requirement of single V2I link. Moreover, the sum achievable rate of V2I links is enhanced by controlling the trajectory of UAV in real time.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Separation Thresholds for Self-Separation of Unmanned Aircraft System in Dynamic Airspace,"The key challenge to integrate the unmanned aircraft system (UAS) into airspace is to develop a means to sense and avoid (SAA) other aircrafts. The main function of the SAA is self-separation, i.e. remaining well clear of the other aircrafts. The separation thresholds must be quantitatively defined for the UAS to autonomously maintain self-separation. In this paper, the separation thresholds are defined quantitatively for the UAS in a dynamic airspace full of aircrafts that differ in motion state and performance. Then, a sector-like dynamic collision-free region (CFR) was set up around the UAS. The size of the CRF can be adjusted adaptively according to the relative motion states of the surrounding intruders, the performance of the UAS, and the altitude of the airspace. The simulation results show that the proposed adaptive separation thresholds adapted to the dynamic airspace environment better than the fixed separation thresholds recommended by Sense Avoid Science and Research Panel (SARP), and controlled the missing and false alarm rates on low levels. This means our adaptive separation thresholds can effectively balance the safety and operation efficiency of the airspace.",Drone,2019
Integrated Velocity Measurement Algorithm Based on Optical Flow and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform,"The pyramid Lucas-Kanade (LK) optical flow algorithm has been widely used in velocity measurement applications. However, these applications are limited by some shortcomings of the algorithm, such as its slow calculation speed and susceptibility to illumination changes. To solve these problems, a data fusion scheme based on the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and optical flow is proposed to alleviate the dependence of the optical flow on the illumination conditions. In addition, an improved cubature Kalman filter (CKF) based on multi-rate residual correction (CKF-MRC) is proposed to solve the problem of inconsistency between the sampling frequencies of the SIFT and the optical flow, and takes full advantage of the high sampling frequency of SIFT. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CKF-MRC method can effectively improve the accuracy of velocity measurement under variable illumination conditions with a high sampling frequency.",Drone,2019
Trajectory Tracking Control for a QUAV With Performance Constraints,"In this paper, a trajectory tracking control scheme is developed for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV) with unknown inertial moments and unknown interconnections among every attitude subsystem. In this scheme, the overall control system is decoupled into a position subsystem and an attitude subsystem. For the position subsystem, a position constraints controller is proposed, while a prescribed performance constraints controller is developed for the attitude subsystem. It is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and that both the position constraints and the prescribed performance constraints on attitude tracking errors can be achieved by guaranteeing the boundedness of the filtered tracking errors. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",Drone,2019
A Two-Step Environment-Learning-Based Method for Optimal UAV Deployment,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used as low-altitude flight base stations to satisfy the coverage requirements of wireless users in various scenarios. In practical applications, since the transmitted power and energy resources of the UAVs are limited and the propagation environments are complicated and time-variant, it is challenging to control a group of UAVs to ensure coverage performance while preserving the connectivity and safety of the UAV networks. To this end, a two-step environment-learning-based method is proposed for the intelligent deployment of the UAVs. First, a machine learning algorithm is used to establish an accurate prediction model of the link qualities from the UAVs to the users under a specific scenario for the next step. Then, a modified deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is employed to control the movements of the UAVs according to the predicted link qualities and to maximize the proportion of covered users. The prioritized experience replay mechanism is introduced to the standard DDPG algorithm to accelerate the deployment procedure. The coverage performance is analyzed in both the interference-free situation and the situation with co-channel interference. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method has a higher convergence speed than the standard DDPG method. Additionally, the proposed deployment method can achieve higher coverage performance and better adaptability to the dynamic environment than three commonly used methods, the random method, the K-means-based method, and the statistical-channel-model-based method.",Drone,2019
An Improved Nonlinear Multibody Dynamic Model for a Parafoil-UAV System,"A recovery system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a steerable parafoil is an attractive concept. However, due to the complex interaction between the parafoil and the UAV, this parafoil system has not seen widespread use in the UAV recovery. Under the influence of the UAV, the suspension lines of the system are not always tight, so most of the existing models do not work. To analyze the parafoil and UAV interaction when the suspension lines are tight or slack, this study presents a method for improving a multibody dynamic model for a parafoil-UAV system. The parafoil and UAV are modeled as usual, while the suspension lines are modeled as a combination of several linear viscoelastic elements. All models are coupled, and the nonlinear equations of motion are then derived. To analyze the influence of the invalid suspension lines, this improved model has been compared with an 8-degrees of freedom model. The comparisons demonstrate that the simulation results of the improved model and the 8-DoF model are similar under a small control input. However, under a large control input, the results become significantly different. In an actual flight test, the accuracy of this improved model is found to be better than the 8-DoF model. Finally, an attitude optimal control system is designed for this improved model. The performance of this autonomous control is presented at the end of this paper.",Drone,2019
Secure mmWave Communication Using UAV-Enabled Relay and Cooperative Jammer,"Communication assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been regarded as an effective technique for reliability improvement in both military and civilian domains, whereas it also makes the information vulnerable to passive eavesdropping due to its wide broadcast. In this paper, we investigate the secure millimeter wave (mmWave) communication assisted by multiple UAV-enabled relays and jammers, where exist multiple randomly distributed eavesdroppers on the ground. Leveraging the models of 3D-antenna gain and stochastic geometry, new closed-form expressions of secrecy outage probability are derived on the basis of the opportunistic relay selection scheme involving the characteristics of air-to-ground channel, and the secrecy improvement is demonstrated when the relay density increases. In addition, a cooperative jamming scheme, where a part of UAVs transmit the jamming signals, is designed to degrade the qualities of eavesdropping channels and further enhance physical layer security. The simulation results show the impacts of different system parameters on secrecy outage probability and verify our analysis. It's also revealed that there exist the optimal attitude of UAVs, jamming power and density of jammers for achieving the best secrecy performance.",Drone,2019
On the Performance of Low-Altitude UAV-Enabled Secure AF Relaying With Cooperative Jamming and SWIPT,"This paper proposes a novel cooperative secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided transmission protocol, where a source sends confidential information to a destination via an energy-constrained UAV-mounted amplify-and-forward relay in the presence of a ground eavesdropper. We adopt destination-assisted cooperative jamming as well as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer at the UAV-mounted relay to enhance physical-layer security and transmission reliability. Assuming a low-altitude UAV, we derive connection probability, secrecy outage probability, instantaneous secrecy rate, and average secrecy rate of the proposed protocol over Air-Ground channels, which are modeled as Rician fading with elevation-angel dependent parameters. Further, we analyze the asymptotic average secrecy rate performance of the proposed UAV-relaying scheme and derive high signal-to-noise ratio measures of the average secrecy rate to highlight the effect of various channel features on the system performance. By simulations, we verify our novel theoretical exact and approximate results and demonstrate significant performance improvement of our protocol, when compared to conventional transmission protocol with ground relaying and UAV-based transmission protocol without exploiting destination jamming. Finally, we evaluate the impacts of various system parameters, specifically, find the optimal UAV placement on the proposed protocol in terms of the aforementioned secrecy metrics.",Drone,2019
Joint Trajectory-Task-Cache Optimization in UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Networks for Cyber-Physical System,"This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile edge network for Cyber-Physical System (CPS), where UAV with fixed-wing or rotary-wing is dispatched to provide communication and mobile edge computing (MEC) services to ground terminals (GTs). To minimize the energy consumption so as to extend the endurance of the UAV, we intend to jointly optimize its 3D trajectory and the task-cache strategies among GTs to save the energies spent on flight propulsion and GT tasks. Such joint trajectory-task-cache problem is difficult to be optimally solved, as it is non-convex and involves multiple constraints. To tackle this problem, we reformulate the optimizing of task offloading and cache into two tractable linear program (LP) problems, and the optimizing of UAV trajectory into three convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratically Program (QCQP) problems on horizontal trajectory, vertical trajectory and flight time of the UAV respectively. Then a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to iteratively solve the formed sub-problems through a successive convex optimization (SCO) process. A high-quality sub-optimal solution to the joint problem then will be obtained, after the algorithm converging to a prescribed accuracy. The numerical results show the proposed solution significantly outperforms the baseline solution.",Drone,2019
Heterogeneous UAV Cells: An Effective Resource Allocation Scheme for Maximum Coverage Performance,"This paper develops an effective approach for the 3D deployment of a heterogeneous set of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as aerial base stations that provide maximum wireless coverage for ground users in a given geographical area. This problem is addressed in two steps. First, in order to maximize the utilization of each UAV, its optimal flight altitude is found based on the UAV's transmit power which provides maximum coverage radius on the ground. The UAVs are classified into separate groups based on their transmit powers and optimal flight altitudes. Next, given a repository of UAVs belonging to different classes, the proposed technique finds an optimal subset of the available UAVs along with their optimal 3D placement to provide the maximum network coverage for a given area on the ground with the minimum power consumption. This optimization problem is proved to be NP-hard, for which a novel algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution and provide valuable insights into the performance of the Heterogeneous UAV-supported small cell networks.",Drone,2019
Joint Optimization of Multi-UAV Target Assignment and Path Planning Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"One of the major research topics in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collaborative control systems is the problem of multi-UAV target assignment and path planning (MUTAPP). It is a complicated optimization problem in which target assignment and path planning are solved separately. However, recalculation of the optimal results is too slow for real-time operations in dynamic environments because of the large number of calculations required. In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence method named simultaneous target assignment and path planning (STAPP) based on a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm, which is a type of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. In STAPP, the MUTAPP problem is first constructed as a multi-agent system. Then, the MADDPG framework is used to train the system to solve target assignment and path planning simultaneously according to a corresponding reward structure. The proposed system can deal with dynamic environments effectively as its execution only requires the locations of the UAVs, targets, and threat areas. Real-time performance can be guaranteed as the neural network used in the system is simple. In addition, we develop a technique to improve the training effect and use experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Course Control-Based Trajectory Linearization Control for Uncertain Unmanned Surface Vehicle Under Rudder Saturation,"In the presence of the uncertain system dynamics, unknown time-varying disturbances and rudder saturation, this paper develops a novel robust adaptive course control scheme for unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Considering the characteristics of the rudder servo system, a double loop course controller of the practical and concise is proposed by the enhanced trajectory linearization control (TLC) technology. The key features of the developed controller are that, first, the neural networks are employed to online approximate unmodeled dynamics, and adaptive techniques are adopted to deal with completely unknown external disturbances; second, auxiliary systems that are governed by smooth switching functions, are developed in an unprecedented manner to compensate for the saturation constraints on actuators. The main innovation can be summarized as that the TLC technology is applied to the USV motion control field as a new control algorithm, and the enhanced technology based on traditional TLC not only reduces the number of adjustment parameters but also has simple structure and high robustness. Furthermore, a low frequency learning method improves the applicability of the algorithm. The stability analysis is established using the Lyapunov theory. Simulation results and comparison verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.",Drone,2019
VENUE: Virtualized Environment for Multi-UAV Network Emulation,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have progressively been integrated into people lives during the last years. It is quite common now to see UAVs flying in the countryside doing field inspection, in highways for traffic control operations, or above stadiums in sport and music events. It is also common to see spectacular UAV swarm showcases (in most cases they are just performing a choreography) showing the potential of upcoming technologies. This article is focused on multi-UAV scenarios, on the establishment of Flying Ad hoc Networks (FANETs), and on the integration of 5G technologies like Network Function Virtualization (NFV) or Software Defined Networking (SDN). In particular, this article presents a proposal for one of the most common problems that the research and development community has to face at some stage: the validation of the different solutions and deployments. In this area, there is currently a notorious gap between the design phase and the deployment phase, since traditional network simulators are not designed with the constraints imposed by UAVs in mind. Besides, services implementations (that are usually distributed into single-board computers carried as payloads by UAVs) cannot be easily combined with the simulators. VENUE (Virtualized Environment for multi-UAV network emulation) is presented as an experimentation platform that allows testing the integration of multi-UAV FANETs together with network services deployments. VENUE covers from the simulation/emulation phase up to the real equipment integration phase. The validation of the platform is also presented in this article through several UAV use cases that make use of NFV technologies.",Drone,2019
A Simplified BDS Broadcast Ephemeris and State Space Representative (SSR) Matching Method for BDS-Only Real-Time Precise Point Positioning (PPP),"As opposed to the GPS real-time precise point positioning (PPP) with sophisticated orbit/clock recovery method, BDS real-time PPP applications were limited by the fact that no internationally recognized BDS issue of data (IOD) calculation and matching method was defined. This paper proposes a simplified BDS broadcast ephemeris and state space representative (SSR) matching method for the BDS precise orbit and clock recovery in real time. Unlike the existing method, the proposed method does not need to perform IOD calculation which involves several bitwise operations. Instead, it only needs to monitor the BDS SSR IOD updating status. Comparison result shows that the proposed method can reduce 6.97% computational time for the 24-hour real-time orbit/clock product recovery. Using the proposed matching method, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) BDS real-time orbit and clock product from day of year (DOY) 119 to 128 2018 were evaluated. By comparing the 10-day dataset with German Research Centre for Geosciences Potsdam (GFZ) final products, we could see that BDS real-time orbit accuracies were greatly improved, i.e. 1.644-6.143 m real-time precise orbit for Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, 0.059-0.286 m for Inclined Geosynchronous Satellite Orbit (IGSO)/Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites. In the meantime, 0.12-2.32 ns real-time clock precision was obtained. Both static and kinematic tests were adopted to evaluate BDS-only real-time PPP using CNES real-time corrections. The results indicated that cm-level horizontal and <0.1 m vertical precisions were obtained in static experiment. As for the kinematic test, <0.1 m horizontal and dm-level vertical precisions were obtained in an unmanned aerial vehicle experiment.",Drone,2019
Power Allocation in UAV-Enabled Relaying Systems for Secure Communications,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile relaying technique is a promising approach in providing high data rate transmission. Limitations of the UAV's hardware and the line-of-sight link of the air-to-ground channel make UAV ground communication more vulnerable to wiretap and spoof threats. This paper tackles the secure transmission problem with physical layer security (PLS) technologies. A four-node wiretap channel with UAV-enabled relay is considered and eavesdroppers' location information is partially known that they are in a certain area with variable densities. We put forward the secrecy rate maximization problem aiming at optimizing the source/relay transmission power. The objective function and constraints are proved to be non-convex and we convert the non-convex problem to a convex one by introducing the difference-of-concave (DC) programming and slack variables. For a special case, a closed-form solution is obtained which greatly reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The simulation result shows that with the proposed algorithm, the system with partial eavesdroppers' location information can achieve a pretty good secrecy performance close to that in the case with perfect location information.",Drone,2019
Online Camera-Gimbal-Odometry System Extrinsic Calibration for Fixed-Wing UAV Swarms,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms show a broad application prospect in the future. For most individuals of UAV swarms, their perception systems consist of onboard camera, gimbal and odometry. It is necessary to efficiently obtain accurate extrinsic parameters of camera-gimbal-odometry systems for UAV swarms. Traditional extrinsic calibration methods for camera-gimbal-odometry system often need manual assistances. For a large number of individuals of UAV swarms, it is time- and labor-consuming to complete the calibration using traditional methods. To tackle this problem, we propose an online extrinsic calibration algorithm and design a parallel procedure to realize an efficient calibration for UAV swarms. Without any dependence on manual operation and communication with ground station, the calibration for each individual is completed on onboard processor. Instead of manual labelling, a fast and accurate detection module is firstly built for samples auto-labeling. Facing the challenge of limited computing power of onboard processor, our auto-labeling algorithm shows a strong real-time capability and robustness. Then, an optimization module is developed to iteratively refine the extrinsic. Using multiple fixed-wing UAVs, online calibration experiments were conducted in larger-scale outdoor, and the results validated the feasibility of our method. Compared with some state-of-the-arts, the proposed extrinsic calibration method showed superior performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.",Drone,2019
Joint Maneuver and Beamwidth Optimization for UAV-Enabled Multicasting,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted communications have been an essential complement of conventional wireless networks. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled multicasting system, where a UAV with a directional antenna of adjustable beamwidth is employed to disseminate a common file to a group of ground users. By minimizing the mission completion time, we investigate how beamwidth control would affect the UAVs three-dimensional (3D) location/trajectory. First, we consider the quasi-stationary UAV scenario, where the UAV is deployed at a static location. In this case, we jointly optimize the 3D UAV location and antenna beamwidth under the practical constraints on the UAVs altitude and beamwidth, while ensuring that all users are covered by the main lobe of the UAV antenna. Although this problem is nonconvex, its global optimality can be obtained by using a two-step algorithm, where semi-closed solutions of the 3D location and beamwidth are derived. Next, in the mobile UAV scenario, a joint 3D UAV trajectory and beamwidth design is proposed, additionally constrained by the horizontal and vertical speed. To tackle this nonconvex problem, we develop an iterative optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation techniques, which updates the 3D trajectory and beamwidth simultaneously in each iteration. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design as compared to benchmark schemes.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Fuzzy Control Method for a Single Tilt Tricopter,"This article proposes an adaptive fuzzy gain scheduling (FSG) design of the traditional proportional integral derivative (PID) control method by using fuzzy logic rules to schedule controlled gains at different phases. Owing to minimization of the tracking error of the controller design using three parameters and the integral of time weighted-squared error (ITSE) minima criterion of the controller design process, the fuzzy rules of the triangular membership functions are exploited online to verify the PID controller gains in different operated scheduling modes. For that reason, the controller designs can be used to tune the system models during the whole operation time period to enable efficient error tracking. The continuous genetic algorithm (GA) is considered an innovation because in it, the decode chromosome step is totally neglected. Owing to this improvement, it is superior to the standard GA because it requires less storage and enables naturally faster convergence. In this research, the controlled parameters were optimized using the continuous GA to enhance the efficiency of the proposed method. Thereafter, it was implemented to a single tilt Tricopter model to test whether the control performance is better when compared with the conventional PID control method.",Drone,2019
Long-Range Wireless Tethering Selfie Camera System Using Wireless Sensor Networks,"This paper proposes a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based long-range wireless tethering system (WSN-SELFIE) that implements the novel GIGA-SELFIE system that can take selfies and landscape photos from long distances. In WSN-SELFIE, a low-power WSN using radio frequency (RF) transceiver modules is used to provide long-range communication between a camera and a sensor node. The operating range of WSN-SELFIE can be extended easily by adding more relay nodes to the network. The experimental results demonstrate that WSN-SELFIE performs efficiently in terms of network range, end-to-end network delay, and processing time. Furthermore, it outperforms commercial photography drones and GIGA-SELFIE in terms of cost and runtime.",Drone,2019
Eccentricity Failure Detection of Brushless DC Motors From Sound Signals Based on Density of Maxima,"Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) motors have been used in a wide range of fields. In some critical applications, failures in these machines can cause operational disasters and cost lives if they are not detected in advance. The classical methods for detecting incipient faults in BLDC motors perform processing of the current signal to obtain the required information. In this work, the SAC-DM (Signal Analysis based on Chaos using Density of Maxima) technique is applied for the first time in the diagnosis of failures of electromechanical systems from sound signals. Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis (WMA) is used to separate a chaotic signal component from the sound emitted by the motor. This work demonstrates that it is feasible to perform dynamic eccentricity diagnosis in BLDC motors by identifying variations of the SAC-DM of the sound signal. The technique exposed in this work requires low computational cost and achieves high success rate. To validate the method, tests were carried out on a small BLDC motor normally used in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), demonstrating the ability of the method to detect the speed of the motor in 95.89 of the cases and to detect eccentricity problems at a fixed speed in 88.34 of the cases.",Drone,2019
A Self-Heuristic Ant-Based Method for Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Complex 3-D Space With Dense U-Type Obstacles,"Optimal path planning is required in autonomous navigation and intelligent control of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, as a kind of common obstacles in complex three-dimensional (3-D) spaces, U-type obstacles may cause UAV to be confused and even lead to a collision or out of control. Although most of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm can generate proper path, solutions to U-type obstacles based on the specific behaviors of each ant are investigated rarely. Hence, different search strategies are studied and a novel ACO-based method called Self-Heuristic Ant (SHA) is proposed in this paper. The whole space is constructed by grid workspace model firstly, and then a new optimal function for UAV path planning is built. To avoid ACO deadlock state (i.e., ants are trapped in U-type obstacles when there is no optional successor node), two different search strategies are designed for choosing the next path node. In addition, the SHA is utilized to improve the ability of the basic ACO-based method. Specifically, besides pheromone update, a new information communion mechanism is fused to deal with the special areas which contain dense obstacles or many concave blocks. Finally, several experiments are investigated deeply. The results show that the deadlock state can be reduced effectively by the designed two different search strategies of ants. More importantly, compared with the conventional fallback strategy, the average number of retreats and the average running time of ACO can be reduced when SHA is applied.",Drone,2019
Design and Implementation of Optical Fiber SSD Exploiting FPGA Accelerated NVMe,"Missions, both near Earth and deep space, are under consideration that will require data recorder capacities doubled at a rate of approximately every three years. This challenge for ever-increasing mass storage also exists in other applications, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and echo recording for phased array radar (PAR). All these scenarios call for storage devices with larger capacity, higher I/O bandwidth, lower latency and smaller size. In this paper, we combine Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based efficient cores of the emerging Non-Volatile Memory express (NVMe) protocol with Flash storage to improve the I/O bandwidth and latency from the operating system (OS) storage I/O software stack. We provide an alternating operation scheme to guarantee consistency of I/O bandwidth. The device has two independent optical fiber channels to ensure the reliability of interconnections and four NVMe flash storage recording data respectively at the same time, which increase its integration and scalability. The prototype has a capacity of 8TB and a volume of only 990 cubic centimeter, weighing only 2.2 pounds. Experimental results demonstrate that the continuous I/O bandwidth of each channel is above 1GBps with variance no more than 7 for its total capacity, and NVMe host logic core achieves up to 88 lower latency against the OS-based system.",Drone,2019
UAV-Enabled Multiple Traffic Backhaul Based on Multiple RANs: A Batch-Arrival-Queuing-Inspired Approach,"In this paper, we investigate the air-to-ground multi-traffic backhaul enabled by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with multiple radio access networks (RANs). Faced with the challenging traffic designation problem over diverse RANs, an efficient packet delivery scheme based on multi-priority batch arrival queuing theory is proposed to match various traffics with multiple RANs. Specifically, our contributions are three-fold: 1) The average queuing time of UAV-enabled multi-RAN access is theoretically derived according to multi-priority batch arrival queuing theory. 2) The priority factor and z-type utility function are well tailored by leveraging the derived queuing time. 3) A multiple traffic backhaul strategy is further proposed by exploiting the priority factor and z-type utility function to optimize the packet delivery, i.e., maximizing the delay utility via joint network selection and power allocation for diverse RANs. The simulation results show that the average delay of delay-sensitive packets is reduced by 15, and the overall packet delivery quality is improved considerably.",Drone,2019
A Flexible Collision Avoidance Strategy for the Formation of Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This paper develops a flexible collision avoidance strategy for the formation of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV). Firstly, To make full use of the information flow from the communication of the formation, an improved artificial potential field (IAPF) function is constructed by adding the communication topology and communication weights. Based on the IAPF functions, both collision avoidance within the formation and obstacle avoidance outside the formation are well organized to ensure flight safety. Secondly, to fuse collision avoidance and formation keeping, we design the null space behavioral (NSB) approach to combine them into a single motion command, where the formation keeping algorithm is designed as a second-order consensus algorithm. In this way, the flexible collision avoidance strategy is proposed based on IAPF and consensus, handling the relationship between collision avoidance and formation keeping flexibly. Finally, three-dimensional multi-UAV flight simulation validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy that the formation can both implement collision avoidance quickly and keep a good geometric formation configuration simultaneously.",Drone,2019
Study on Flight Performance of Propeller-Driven UAV,"The engine performance test at altitudes of 0-7000m was carried out on the high-performance test bench of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) piston engine. The flight performance of UAV was studied, including propeller thrust characteristics, maneuverability, flight envelope, and cruise performance. The results showed that with the increase in altitudes, the UAV climb rate gradually decreased; the maximum climb rate decreased from 2.5m/s at 2000m to 0.5m/s at 7000m. The maximum flight altitude is 7000m, and the flight speed range is about 47m/s-52m/s at the altitude of 7000m. Maximum navigation range and endurance of UAV decrease by 5.8% and 8%, respectively, with each increment of 1000m in altitudes.",Drone,2019
IMPROVEMENT OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE CLUSTER ATMOSPHERIC MONITORING ALGORITHMS,"In order to realise real-time and efficient monitoring of atmospheric environment by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) cluster, a new route planning algorithm for UAV is proposed. Based on the idea of artificial potential field method, obstacle threat is combined with distance cost in the form of fitness function. Smooth potential functions with finite cutoff points are constructed by A and B and used to calculate obstacle threat values. Due to the fast convergence speed of PFSGA (Periodic Fast Search Genetic Algorithms), the air monitoring model of UAV cluster based on PFSGA is designed, and all kinds of costs are taken into account in the model. The simulation results show that the improved algorithm has better optimisation effect and can realise atmospheric monitoring quickly and dynamically. It also provides a new idea for environmental monitoring.",Drone,2019
Forecasting Parameters of Satellite Navigation Signal through Artificial Neural Networks for the Purpose of Civil Aviation,"Navigation is a key element influencing fluent, rapid, and safe transport of people and goods. During the last years, special attention was paid to satellite navigation, which is a part of radionavigation where positioning is done thanks to artificial satellites. Issues of application and development of satellite navigation systems in civil aviation are the subject of numerous research and scientific studies in the world. The quality of satellite signal determined by parameters such as accuracy, continuity, availability, and integrity determines possibility of its operational use. Particular attention of scientific research is therefore devoted to the requirements and limitations imposed on satellite systems prior to their implementation in aviation. This extremely important aspect justified undertaking of the aforementioned problem in this article. The paper attempts to answer the question on how to facilitate selection of navigation techniques for the aircraft operator, taking into account factors determining the accuracy, continuity, availability, and integrity of the satellite signal. As a result, the purpose of the work was defined as development of a method for forecasting the values of satellite navigation signal parameters used in air transport by artificial neural networks, taking into account selected atmospheric conditions. Results included in the work indicate further directions of satellite navigation system development. Due to authors' opinion, the researches should focus especially on the analysis of real-time satellite signal parameter performance or creating applications for UAVs automatically deciding about used techniques of navigation.",Drone,2019
A L-1 Adaptive Control Scheme for UAV Carrier Landing Using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion,"This paper presents a L-1 adaptive controller augmenting a dynamic inversion controller for UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) carrier landing. A three axis and a power compensator NDI (nonlinear dynamic inversion) controller serves as the baseline controller for this architecture. The inner-loop command inputs are roll-rate, pitch-rate, yaw-rate, and thrust commands. The outer-loop command inputs come from the guidance law to correct the glide slope. However, imperfect model inversion and nonaccurate aerodynamic data may cause degradation of performance and may lead to the failure of the carrier landing.

Finite-Time Formation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Switching Topologies and Disturbances: An Average Dwell Time Approach,"This paper investigates the finite-time formation problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with switching topologies and external disturbances. The formation problem is first transformed into the finite-time stability and bounded problems of a switched system, respectively. In particular, the finite-time unachievable topology is concerned for unreliable information exchanges. By employing the average dwell time (ADT) method, sufficient criteria are established to deal with the switching topologies such that the desired time-varying formation can be achieved in finite time. Then, the topology-dependent controller can be designed in terms of matrix technique. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the effectiveness of our proposed formation strategy.",Drone,2019
UAV-Based Gigapixel Panoramic Image Acquisition Planning with Ray Casting-Based Overlap Constraints,"Panoramic imaging is information-rich, low-cost, and effective. In panoramic image acquisition, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a natural advantage that owes to their flexibility and relatively large observation ranges. Using a panoramic gimbal and a single camera may be the most common means of capturing gigapixel panoramas. In order to manage the constraints of UAV power and facilitate the use of a variety of camera lenses, an effective and flexible method for planning UAV gigapixel panorama acquisitions is required. To address this need, a panoramic image acquisition planning method is proposed in this paper. The method defines image overlaps via a ray casting procedure and then generates an acquisition plan according to the constraints of horizontal and vertical overlap thresholds. This method ensures the completeness of the panorama by maintaining the overlap between adjacent images. Two experiments, including simulated and field cases, were performed to evaluate the proposed method through comparisons with an existing panorama acquisition plan. Results showed that the proposed method can capture complete panoramas with fewer images.",Drone,2019

The Maintenance and Management Method of Deteriorated Facilities Using 4D map Based on UAV and 3D Point Cloud,"According to the survey on the status of aged buildings in Korea, A number of concrete buildings deterioration such as houses and apartment buildings has been increased rapidly. To solve this problem, the research related to the facility management, that is one of the importance factor, for monitoring buildings has been increased.

To achieve this, the planner can reorient the UAVs cameras and modify the UAVs heading, speed, and height with the purpose of making the UAV reach and the camera observe faster the areas with high probability of target presence. Besides, the planner uses a digital elevation model of the search region to capture its influence on the camera likelihood (changing the footprint dimensions and the probability of detection) and to help the operator to construct the initial belief of target presence and target motion model. The planner also lets the operator include intelligence information in the initial target belief and motion model, in order to let him/her model real-world scenarios systematically. All these characteristics let the planner adapt the UAV trajectories and sensor poses to the requirements of minimum time search operations over real-world scenarios, as the results of the paper, obtained over 3 scenarios built with the modeling aid-tools of the planner, show.",Drone,2019

Distributed system of virtual machines for self-organized networks,"Introduction: Active data, being fragments of executable code transmitted between the nodes of an active network, are an effective mechanism for the operation of software-reconfigurable distributed systems. Previously, in the works devoted to active data, not enough attention was paid to the implementation of the runtime environment (the processor) for the executable code of active data, as well as to the issues of building hypervisors and load balancing in distributed systems. Purpose: Developing principles for the construction of virtual machines with active data, providing the reconfigurability of the target devices and network flexibility in general. Evaluating the possibility of using the existing approaches to load balancing for networks with active data. Methods: Our study uses the principles of software-defined system development, the conception of active data, theoretical foundations and technology of virtualization. Results: Is has been proposed to use a distributed system of virtual machines as an active data execution environment, based on the object-oriented approach to creating distributed applications. Each node of such a distributed system of virtual machines can act as either a control or slave node during the object interaction. Based on the developed approach, we proposed to solve the problem of building a network of repeaters using active data, considering an unmanned aerial vehicle as an element of an active info-communication network which supports the active data technology. Since a distributed system of virtual machines enables asymmetric distribution of decentralized network nodes, a method has been developed for a distributed system whose nodes are unmanned aerial vehicles and a control node, to control the asymmetry value by creating objects of various decomposition levels.

The algorithm of adaptive adjustment of the parameters of the linear discrete filter using fuzzy expert system,"The problem of linear discrete filtering of trajectory measurements in the conditions of aircraft maneuver is considered. It is shown that currently there is an active use as carriers of telecommunication equipment of flight-lifting equipment for various purposes, for example, unmanned aerial vehicles. For radio monitoring of such objects it is necessary to perform their spatial identification based on the analysis of trajectory information. The sources of trajectory information are information-measuring systems of various types, both active and passive. For the processing of trajectory measurements in the conditions of maneuvering of the aircraft, it is proposed to use a linear discrete filter - ?alpha-beta? filter. To prevent an increase in the dynamic errors of the filter when maneuvering the aircraft, it is proposed to use the adaptation of its parameters. The aim of the work is to reduce the dynamic error of trajectory measurements filtering in the conditions of aircraft maneuver. The problem to be solved is the development of an algorithm for adaptive adjustment of the linear discrete filter parameters to the maneuver intensity using a fuzzy expert system. To adapt the ?alpha-beta? filter, two tasks were solved sequentially: maneuver detection and control of the filter gain. The detection of the maneuver is based on the majority criterion ?two out of three?. To control the filter gain, a fuzzy expert system in the form of a set of fuzzy logic rules is used. The input variables of the expert system are linguistic variables ?filtering error type? and ?relative error module value?, the output variable is ?gain value?. A block diagram of the adaptive filter is presented. The results of mathematical modeling are presented.",Drone,2019

The Research of Unmanned Aircraft Evasive Maneuvers from Attack by Enemy Aircraft on the Basis of the Game Approach,"Actual level of unmanned aerial vehicles development allows us to consider them as an effective tool for solving a variety of civil and military tasks (primarily reconnaissance and strike). At the same time, one of the most important problems associated with the combat use of unmanned aerial vehicles remains to ensure their high survivability in organized counteraction conditions, the source of which can be both ground-based air defense and fighter aircraft (manned or unmanned). For this reason, the study and optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle evasion maneuvers from an enemy air attack remains relevant.

Note that the increase in the values of tactical indicators that reflect the maneuverability of the attacked UAV compared to the enemy, leads to the fact that in all cases, regardless of the initial position of the attacked UAV relative to the UAV-interceptor, it is ensured that it is brought beyond the zone of possible launches of guided missiles.",Drone,2019
Entropy Approach to the Search Problem Considering the Overland Objects Observability Factor,"The paper presents a technique for path planning in case of secondary search of overland mobile objects by unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a surveillance system. The search area is presented as a set of discrete fragments - regions of iInterests (ROI). So, the path planning problem is to consistently select the ROI for survey.

UAV FUNCTIONING MODE OPTIMIZATION WHILE SEAWATER SAMPLING,"Water is a necessary factor for the humankind survival. For this reason, the quality of water resources should be protected. Thus, it is necessary to organize permanent monitoring of water resources. Industrial and agricultural wastes are the main sources representing danger for water basins. Water quality of rivers and lakes may be evaluated by monitoring such indices as quantity of dissolved oxygen, pH., temperature, and electric conductance. Low concentration of oxygen dissolved in the water, undesirable temperature and abnormal salt content lead to water quality degradation. The article is dedicated to the issues of UAV application for the seawater salinity and conductance determining. The UAV application for this purpose allows increasing space-time resolution of the results of the studies being performed. The task of forming the UAV empirical model in water sampling mode was formulated. Electric conductance sensors while corresponding UAV flight altitude control are being immersed into the water and taken out after conduction measuring. Thermal sensors are applied herewith, installed on the other UAV flying 30-40 meters higher than the first one.

Importance of machine learning for enhancing ecological studies using information-rich imagery,"There is increasing demand for efficient ways to process large volumes of data from visual-based remote-technology, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in ecology and conservation, with machine learning methods representing a promising avenue to address varying user demands. Here, we evaluated current trends in how machine learning and UAVs are used to process imagery data for detecting animals and vegetation across habitats, placing emphasis on their utility for endangered species. We reviewed 213 publications that used UAVs at 256 study sites, of which just 89 (42 %) used machine learning to assess the visual data. We evaluated geographical and temporal trends and identified how each technology is used at a global scale. We also identified the most commonly encountered machine-learning methods, including potential reasons for their limited use in ecology and possible solutions. Thirteen out of the 17 habitats defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) habitat classification scheme were monitored using UAVs, while 12 habitats were monitored using both UAVs and machine learning. Our results show that, while machine learning is already being used across many habitat types, it is primarily restricted to more uniform habitats at present. Out of 173 plant and animal species monitored using UAV surveys, 30 were of conservation concern, with machine learning being used to assess UAV imagery data for 9 of these species. In conclusion, we anticipate that the joint use of UAVs and machine learning for ecological research and conservation will expand as machine learning methods become more accessible.",Drone,2019
Coverage and Rate Analysis of Cache-Enabled Vertical Heterogeneous Networks,"The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as the aerial base stations (ABSs) has emerged as a promising approach to improve the coverage and capacity in the 5G network. In this article, cache-enabled vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) is analyzed with the aid of the stochastic geometry approach. The cache-enabled VHetNet framework consisting of ABSs equipped with caches and terrestrial base station (TBSs) is proposed. In the proposed framework, the probabilistic caching strategy is adopted for ABSs and the content-centric association scheme is designed within the cache area with the cache serving radius. Based on the proposed framework, the system performance in terms of the coverage probability and the average rate are analyzed by ignoring the thermal noise under the general channel model incorporating both line-of-sight (LoS)/non-line-of-sight (NLoS) path loss and Nakagami-m fading. The theoretical analysis is verified via the Monte Carlo simulations and the impact of the network parameters on the system performance is analyzed. The simulation results show that there exits the optimal ABSs density, ABSs altitude and cache serving radius to maximize the system performance. Increasing the density of the ABSs deployed at higher altitude may decrease system performance. ABSs with higher density has the smaller optimal cache serving radius. The probabilistic caching strategy outperforms the benchmark caching strategies containing the most popular caching strategy and the random caching strategy.",Drone,2019
Dynamic Soaring Kinetic Energy Reference Frames,"Dynamic soaring in the boundary layer of a vertical variation of horizontal wind offers unmanned aerial vehicle gliders the ability to greatly extend mission endurance. By flying periodic trajectories within these gradients of horizontal winds, a dynamic soaring bird or glider uses the locally accelerating wind to its advantage, extracting sufficient energy from the environment during each trajectory cycle to overcome losses due to induced and parasitic drag. The dynamic soaring literature currently offers two competing definitions of aircraft kinetic energy, pointing to opposing views regarding the source of dynamic soaring energy exchange between the wind and the aircraft. A series of heuristics is developed to logically establish the wind-fixed/wind-aligned reference frame (that is, airspeed) as the appropriate choice for scalar kinetic energy computation while not imposing any such limitation on the usage of arbitrary reference frames for dynamic soaring equations of motion. Furthermore, while acknowledging that other kinetic energy reference frames are valid from the standpoint of physics, only wind-fixed frame kinetic energy tracks useful energy transfer from the vertical gradient of horizontal winds, with no attribution of kinetic energy from downwind turns.",Drone,2019
A REFLECTION-BASED RF SOURCE LOCALIZATION ALGORITH,"In this paper, an RF source localization approach, in non-line of sight condition, using reflected signals, is introduced in which received signal strength indicator and angle of arrival (AOA) observations are used. Furthermore, the optimal positions of the receiver to increase the accuracy of the localization are discussed. In the proposed approach, a reflected signal is modelled by three parameters, i.e., distance between the RF source and the receiver via the reflector, the reflection angle, and the AOA. These parameters are used to determine a locus for the RF source location. Then, by using at least two reflected signals to give two loci for the RF source location, the location of the RF source is determined. Furthermore, the optimal locus of one reflection with respect to the other one is determined. The approach has been simulated, and the results show better accuracy of localization for optimal pairs compared to the other pairs, which decreases the search time.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Closed-Loop System Identification of a Quadcopter,"Real-time estimation of dynamic model parameters for an unmanned aircraft can provide valuable information about the dynamics of the vehicle. However, the aircraft model estimation performance can be severely degraded with an active control system and highly collinear model terms such as those found on a quadrotor unmanned aircraft. Model parameters were estimated based on dynamic flight data of a quadcopter aircraft. System identification maneuvers were generated using varying-amplitude orthogonal multisine input signals applied on a quadcopter with nominal hardware conditions and with a damaged propeller. Recursive Fourier transform regression was applied to dynamic data to estimate parameters of two input model forms: independent and delta input. Prediction capability of the identified models was assessed using data of nearly the same flight conditions. Results indicated that, as the amplitude of the input multisine increased, the identifiability of control effectiveness improved, and prediction error decreased. Overall, a well-designed multi-input multisine input design and Fourier transform regression applied together provided efficient and accurate real-time parameter estimation that effectively overcame challenges imposed by a system subjected to closed-loop control with collinear model terms.",Drone,2019
Visible and Infrared Imaging Based Inspection of Power Installation,"<sec> <title>Abstract</title> ¡ªThe inspection of power lines is the crucial task for the safe operation of power transmission: its components require regular checking to detect damages and faults that are caused by corrosion or any other environmental agents and mechanical stress. During recent years, the use of Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) for environmental and industrial monitoring is constantly growing and the demand for fast and robust algorithms for the analysis of the data acquired by drones during the inspections has increased. In this work, we use UAV to acquire power transmission lines data and apply image processing to highlight expected faults. Our method is based on a fusion algorithm for the infrared and visible power lines images, which is invariant to large scale changes and illumination changes in the real operating environment. Hence, different algorithms from image processing are applied to visible and infrared thermal data, to track the power lines and to detect faults and anomalies. The method significantly identifies edges and hot spots from the set of frames with good accuracy. At the final stage we identify hot spots using thermal images. The paper concludes with the description of the current work, which has been carried out in a research project, namely SCIADRO. </sec>",Drone,2019

Power System Optimization for Electric Hybrid Unmanned Drone,"For drones to be used for industrial or agricultural applications, it is necessary to increase the payload and endurance. Currently, the payload and endurance are limited by the battery technology for electric powered drones. In addition, charging or replacing the batteries may not be a practical solution at the field that requires near continuous operation.

A Study on Target Tracking Performance Enhancement Using Lock-on Time Delay Compensation Method,"If the EOIR equipment mounted on an unmanned aircraft transmits images and receives commands through a data link, there may be delays in data transmission depending on the transmission path of the data and the conditions of the ground equipment or wireless network. This increases the possibility of initial target LOCK-ON failure due to the difference between the time when the received image is viewed and the time when the image is taken. Therefore, this paper proposed a way to use frame indexes to synchronize with images, and to increase the success of target tracking by adding frame indexes to commands from the ground station.",Drone,2019
Optimal Path Planning Algorithm for Visiting Multiple Mission Points in Dynamic Environments,The complexity of path planning for visiting multiple mission points is even larger than that of single pair path planning. Deciding a path for visiting n mission points requires conducting n^2+n times of single pair path planning. We propose Multiple Mission D* Lite(MMD*L) which is an optimal path planning algorithm for visiting multiple mission points in dynamic environments. MMD*L reduces the complexity by reusing the computational data of preceding single pair path planning. Simulation results show that the complexity reduction is significant while its path optimality is not compromised.,Drone,2019
Design and Test of Lateral/Directional Control Law of a Tailless UAV Using Spoilers,"A tailless or Blended-Wing-Body(BWB) shaped configuration is highlighted for UCAV with low RCS characteristics.

Tiny Drone Tracking with a Moving Camera,"With the rapid development in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) and drones, higher request to development of a surveillance system for a drone is putting forward. Since surveillance systems with fixed cameras have a limited range, a development of surveillance systems with a moving camera applicable to PTZ(Pan-Tilt-Zoom) cameras is required. Selecting the features for object plays a critical role in tracking, and the object has to be represented by their shapes or appearances. Considering these conditions, in this paper, an object tracking method with optical flow is introduced to track a tiny drone with a moving camera. In addition, a tracking method combined with kalman filter is proposed to track continuously even when tracking is failed. Experiments are tested on sequences which have a target from the minimal 12 pixels to the maximal 56337 pixels, the proposed method achieves average precision of 175% improvement. Also, experimental results show the proposed method tracks a target which has a size of 12pixels.",Drone,2019
Online Two-Dimensional Route Planning for a Group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This paper suggests a novel approach to online two-dimensional route planning for a coordinated flight of a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that complexifies the modified heuristic and integer matrix algorithms using a new nearness criterion of analyzed points to each route. Asdemonstrated below, this approach guarantees the maximal speed of coordinated flight planning. The modified Dijkstra algorithm that considers the consequences of choosing the nearest point on all future segments of a flight plan is proposed as the heuristic algorithm. For avoiding mistakes in the case of conflict (i.e., assigning a proper route for an analyzed point among the existing options), a modified integer branch-and-bound method is developed that includes the following operations: an alternating analysis of two distance matrices for each UAV; route choice for adding an assigned minimal-length element in each of the matrices. In case of conflict, this method removes short cross connections between paths and their intersections from the flight plan.",Drone,2019

Evaluation of Resolution of UAV-Image Using Circular Target,"We propose a method to evaluate a Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) using a circular target. In addition, a MATLAB GUI-based resolution analysis tool was developed to enhance the reliability of UAV image quality and the efficiency of the work. For this purpose, images were taken with an FC-6310 during flights at altitudes of 80 m, 120 m, and 150 m and by an iXM-100 at altitudes of 150 m, 200 m, and 400 m. The MTFs of UAV images were compared with traditional photogrammetry by measuring and analyzing MTFs on images taken by the UltraCAM Eagle Mark-2 sensor at a flight altitude of 1000 m. The results show that of the FC-6310 were 0.431(80 m), 0.524(120 m), and 0.699(150 m), and those of the iXM-100 were 0.332(150 m), 0.393(200 m), and 0.631(400 m), respectively. At the altitude of 150 m, the image quality of the iXM-100, which has a high-performance camera, was very high, and the effect of the camera performance on the image quality was confirmed. In addition, the of the UltraCAM Eagle Mark-2 was 0.711 due to the high flight altitude. This was the worst value among all UAV images. However, the of the FC-6310 at 150-m altitude was 0.699, which is almost the same as that of a manned aerial image.",Drone,2019
Intake Performance Characteristics according to S-duct Cross-section Shape in UAV,"In many military aircraft, s-shaped diffusers are used to prevent the fan blades of the turbofan engine from being exposed to the outside. The inlet configurations of the air intakes for military aircraft vary, such as the rectangular intake of the F-22, the crescent-like intake of the F-16, elliptical intake of the MQ-25. In this study, the aerodynamic performance of s-shaped diffusers with various inlet configurations was evaluated using numerical analysis. In addition, the configuration of the middle section of an s-shape duct was changed to the crescent shape, and the effects on its aerodynamic performance were investigated.As a result, there was a slight difference in total pressure recovery according to various inlet configurations with ellipse-shaped middle sections. Also, the total pressure distortion was the lowest in the rectangular inlet shape. When the configuration of the middle section was changed from an ellipse to a crescent shape, the total pressure recovery remained at a high level, except for the ellipse-shaped inlet configuration. In terms of total pressure distortion, the duct with the crescent-shaped middle section showed a significantly more uniform pressure distribution than that with the ellipse-shaped middle section.",Drone,2019

In fact. drone was frequently used in terrorist¡¯s attacks, reconnaissance and propaganda mainly by Islamic militants such as Hezbollah and al Qaeda during early and middle in 2000s. After the first terrorist attacks using drones in September 2011, the possibility of drone-use terrorism is very high today. In particular, IS terrorist groups have committed a number of drone-use terrorism by adding inexpensive, easily obtainable additions to commercial drones. As South Korea cannot be regarded as safe from terrorism in the future, it is necessary to prepare countermeasures of institutional, legal and technical aspects to prevent drone-use terrorism.",Drone,2019
Estimation of Drone Velocity with Sum of Absolute Difference between Multiple Frames,"Drones are highly utilized because they can efficiently acquire long-distance videos. In drone operation, the speed, which is the magnitude of the velocity, can be set, but the moving direction cannot be set, so accurate information about the drone¡¯s movement should be estimated. In this paper, we estimate the velocity of the drone moving at a constant speed and direction. In order to estimate the drone's velocity, the displacement of the target frame to minimize the sum of absolute difference (SAD) of the reference frame and the target frame is obtained. The ground truth of the drone¡¯s velocity is calculated using the position of a certain matching point over all frames. In the experiments, a video was obtained from the drone moving at a constant speed at a height of 150 meters. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the estimated velocities in x and y directions and the RMSE of the speed were obtained showing the reliability of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Effect of Aerodynamic Configuration Parameters on Lateral-Directional Stability of Double-Swept Flying Wing Aircraft,"ABSTRACT: Poor lateral-directional stability due to the absence of vertical stabilizer is a great risk to the aircraft with flying wing layout. In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle with this kind of configuration is chosen as the research object. A three-dimensional model of the unmanned aerial vehicle is established, and then the sensitivity analysis is performed to obtain the effects of main aerodynamic shape parameters on lateral-directional flying quality. The results show that the roll mode and spiral mode of the aircraft meet the requirements of Level 1 flying quality in MIL-F-8785C. But the Dutch roll mode is generally divergent, which means that the flying quality of the aircraft is unacceptable. Thus it can be seen that the Dutch roll mode is the key to the dynamic stability of the aircraft. Further studies show that increasing the value of wing aspect ratio or decreasing the values of dihedral angle and torsion angle are useful for improving the Dutch roll mode. It is valuable to reveal the influence mechanism of aerodynamic shape parameters on lateral-directional flying quality for the design of flying wing aircraft.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Filtration of Parameters of the UAV Movement Based on the TDOA-Measurement Sensor Networks,"ABSTRACT: In modern conditions unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) generate new classes of threats, including their use for terrorist purposes. A feature of modern UAVs is the ability to perform sudden maneuvers and to keep the same position in the point in space. For the description of the UAV movement with various types of maneuver it is used a rectangular coordinate system. We use the model in the form of stochastic dynamic system with random structure in the discrete time in which the change type UAV movement occurs at random times. When a UAV emits a sign, its location can be determined by wireless sensor networks (WSN) using the TDOA method. On the basis of a mathematical apparatus of the mixed Markov processes for in discrete time optimal and quasi-optimal adaptive algorithms for filtration of UAV movement parameters based on the TDOA-measurement, sensor networks are synthesized. Devices that realize these algorithms are multichannel and belong to the class of devices with feedback between channels. At the same time, in a quasi-optimal algorithm, a sequential procedure of the arriving measurements from sensors of a sensor network is realized, which allows to avoid the inversion of large-dimensional matrices. An analysis of the quasi-optimal adaptive algorithm is performed using statistical modeling. On the intervals of hovering and of the UAV movements without maneuver, the developed algorithm allows to increase significantly the accuracy of the estimation of the UAV coordinates, and also to recognize various types of its movement with high probability level.",Drone,2019
Longitudinal Aerodynamic and Stability Characteristics of High-Aspect-Ratio Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Gust Response,"ABSTRACT The aim of this work is to propose an accurate and reliable numerical simulation method of gust response, so as to analyze longitudinal stability characteristics of high-aspect-ratio unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under gust response. Based on the dual-time stepping method, the unsteady Navies-Stokes equation was solved. By introducing grid velocity to study the effects of gust, the numerical simulation of gust response was realized. Moreover, the numerical simulation method was verified to be accurate by using the theoretical value and reference value obtained in previous research. The calculation results of the high-aspect-ratio UAV under the 1-cos gust reveal that longitudinal aerodynamic forces of high-aspect-ratio UAVs changed. In the whole range of gust gradient length, the UAVs were always in the state of static stability. However, with the increase of gust velocity, static stability margin decreased. The numerical simulation method of gusts established in this study preferably overcomes the possible numerical oscillations and divergence problems caused by excessive gust velocity. The analysis on longitudinal static stability and stability margin of high-aspect-ratio UAVs under the effects of gusts can ensure flight quality and safety of UAVs under the effects of gusts.",Drone,2019

A Survey of Air-to-Ground Propagation Channel Modeling for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), particularly for small UAVs, due to their affordable prices, wide availability, and relative ease of operability. Existing and future applications of UAVs include remote surveillance and monitoring, relief operations, package delivery, and communication back-haul infrastructure.

Mission-Critical Machine-Type Communication: An Overview and Perspectives Towards 5G,"The machine-type communication (MTC) plays an essential role in the mobile network society and it has demonstrated its effectiveness to generate significant revenues for mobile network operators. The MTC has become the main communication paradigm for several emerging smart services, such as public safety, health care, industrial automation, drones/robotics, utilities, and transportation. The MTC requires a major model change to cope with the improvement in 5G and imposes various requirements on the enabling technology, such as ultra-reliability, low latency, and availability. The scheme that fulfills such requirements are called a mission-critical MTC (mcMTC). However, the mcMTC is still in the early-standardization phase of 5G new radio and it needs a lot of research efforts to be improved.

Multi-UAV Binocular Intersection With One-Shot Communication: Modelling and Algorithms,"Binocular intersection is practically indispensable for stereo visual systems that extract 3D information from images of two distinct cameras. This paper proposes a multi-UAV binocular intersection approach where the two distinct cameras are fixed separately on multiple flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), rather than physically connected with each other as in the pre-existing works. Eventually, both modeling and algorithms are developed for the multi-UAV binocular intersection with extremely limited communication. As the formulated model states, once one flying vehicle detects the target and shares related information only in a one-shot manner, the other vehicles steer their pan-tilt units (Pills) to reconstruct a spatial binocular intersection automatically. The binocular intersection algorithm is further improved from two aspects to maximize the probability of target capture. On one hand, the search scope is narrowed by developing an iterative algorithm with priori terrain height and variance. On the other hand, an approaching navigation law is designed to reduce view occlusion caused by terrain. Extensive simulations with different target speeds and flight altitudes are carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the probability of binocular intersection is over 90% and is subject to little fluctuation against episodic parameter changes. Furthermore, the developed algorithms are verified localization-free and time-saving as well, and hereafter are potentially practicable for micro aerial swarm applications with extremely limited onboard computation and communication.",Drone,2019
Scalability Analysis of Algebraic Graph-Based Multi-UAVs Formation Control,"In multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formation control systems, high scalability can guarantee the formation stability when UAVs join in or leave the system, and thus improves the robustness of the formation flight. This paper investigates the scalability problem for multi-UAV formation control with double-integrator dynamics. To be more specific, we focus how to build communication links with fixed control parameters such that the formation can always keep stable when adding/removing arbitrary number of UAVs. A bio-inspired method - Veteran Rule is proposed to solve this problem. Compared to the existing methods, our proposed method does not require to re-design or adaptively adjust the control parameters/gains for the changed Laplacian matrix. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the system under the Veteran Rule is analyzed. Surprisingly, the convergence rate of the system reaches the maximum value when all the in-degrees equal a particular value, rather than goes to infinity. Moreover, to guarantee the robustness of the formation system, we study the tolerance on undesired communication links (which break our proposed Veteran Rule). An upper bound for the coupling strength of the undesired communication links is provided by using Gershgorin circle theorem. Finally, simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our results.",Drone,2019
UAV-Based Situational Awareness System Using Deep Learning,"Situational awareness by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is important for many applications such as surveillance, search and rescue, and disaster response. In those applications, detecting and locating people and recognizing their actions in near real-time can play a crucial role for preparing an effective response. However, there are currently three main limitations to perform this task efficiently. First, it is currently often not possible to access the live video feed from a UAV's camera due to limited bandwidth. Second, even if the video feed is available, monitoring and analyzing video over prolonged time is a tedious task for humans. Third, it is typically not possible to locate random people via their cellphones. Therefore, we developed the Person-Action-Locator (PAL), a novel UAV-based situational awareness system. The PAL system addresses the first issue by analyzing the video feed onboard the UAV, powered by a supercomputeron-a-module. Specifically, as a support for human operators, the PAL system relies on Deep Learning models to automatically detect people and recognize their actions in near real-time. To address the third issue, we developed a Pixel2GPS converter that estimates the location of people from the video feed. The result - icons representing detected people labeled by their actions - is visualized on the map interface of the PAL system. The Deep Learning models were first tested in the lab and demonstrated promising results. The fully integrated PAL system was successfully tested in the field. We also performed another collection of surveillance data to complement the lab results.",Drone,2019
Fast Lyapunov Vector Field Guidance for Standoff Target Tracking Based on Offline Search,"To address the problem of the long convergence time of traditional Lyapunov Vector Field Guidance (LVFG), a fast convergent LVFG designed with guidance function is proposed. The necessary criteria of a fast convergent vector field are first illustrated through an analysis of the contraction and circulation components. Then, two types of guidance functions of the distance between aircraft and target are constructed to replace the original guidance parameter. Considering the saturation constraints from the aircraft performance, the optimal parameter in guidance functions based on offline search is estimated to achieve the best convergence. Meanwhile, standoff tracking for a moving target is solved with analysis of motion correction. Simulation results indicate the proposed vector field guidance converges faster to the standoff circle without traversing the orbit regardless of whether the aircraft's initial position is inside or outside the circle, even for a moving target. In addition, selection of parameter in the guidance function is proved to make convergence speed approach the limit.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Neural Network Control and Optimal Path Planning of UAV Surveillance System With Energy Consumption Prediction,"A surveillance system is one of the most interesting research topics for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, the problem of planning an energy-efficient path for the surveillance purpose while anticipating disturbances and predicting energy consumptions during the path tracking is still a challenging problem in recent years. The optimal path planning and the disturbance rejection control for a UAV surveillance system are investigated in this paper. A trained and tested energy consumption regression model is used to be the cost function of an optimal path planning scheme, which is designed from a clustered 3D real pilot flight pattern with the proposed K-agglomerative clustering method, and is processed via A-star and set-based particle-swarm-optimization (S-PSO) algorithm with adaptive weights. Moreover, an online adaptive neural network (ANN) controller with varied learning rates is designed to ensure the control stability while having a reliably fast disturbance rejection response. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is verified by numerical simulations and experimental results. By applying the proposed optimal path planning scheme, the energy consumption of the optimal path is only 72.3397 Wh while the average consumed energy of real pilot flight data is 96.593Wh. In addition, the proposed ANN control improves average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of horizontal and vertical tracking performance by 49.083% and 37.50% in comparison with a proportional-integral-differential (PID) control and a fuzzy control under the occurrence of external disturbances. According to all of the results, the combination of the proposed optimal path planning scheme and ANN controller can achieve an energy-efficient UAV surveillance systems with fast disturbance rejection response.",Drone,2019
Power Line Extraction From Aerial Images Using Object-Based Markov Random Field With Anisotropic Weighted Penalty,"The extraction of power line plays a key role in power line inspection by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While it is challenging to extract power lines in aerial images because of the weak targets and the complex background. In this paper, a novel power line extraction method is proposed. First of all, we create a line segment candidate pool which contains power line segments and large amount of other line segments. Secondly, we construct the irregular graph model with these line segments as nodes. Then a novel object-based Markov random field with anisotropic weighted penalty (OMRF-AWP) method is proposed. It defines a new neighborhood system based on the irregular graph model and builds a new potential function by considering the region angle information. With the OMRF-AWP method, we can distinguish between the power line segments and other line segments. Finally, an envelope-based piecewise fitting (EPF) method is proposed to fit the power lines. Experimental results show that the proposed method has good performance in multiple scenes with complex background.",Drone,2019
NAVIGATION COMPLEX WITH ADAPTIVE NON-LINEAR KALMAN FILTER FOR UNMANNED FLIGHT VEHICLE,"A navigation complex of an unmanned flight vehicle of small class is considered.

The accuracy of the assessment depends on the available reliable information on the model of the process under study, which has a high degree of uncertainty. To carry out high-precision correction of the navigation complex, an adaptive non-linear Kalman filter with parametric identification was developed. The model of errors of the inertial navigation system is considered in the navigation complex, which is used in the algorithmic support. The procedure for identifying the parameters of a non-linear model represented by the SDC method in a scalar form is used. The developed adaptive non-linear Kalman filter is compact and easy to implement on board an aircraft.",Drone,2019

To do so, an experiment is proposed to collect the data from multiple IMU sensors over an UAV main board, and submitted to different inclinations before achieving the classification task. The reported results using k nearest neighbors (k - NN), support vector machines (SVM) and Bayes show eficiency during the recognition, obtaining an accuracy score up to 99 %. Besides, the algoritms could be combined along with robust control techniques, which is ideal for implementation in embedded systems with low processing capacities.",Drone,2019
Bistatic RCS calculation for propellers at near-resonant frequencies,"Scattering from propellers is investigated using the 3D Finite Element Method (FEM), alongside a simpler integral equation (IE) method using 1D discretization. It is shown that under certain conditions and near the propellers' resonant frequency, results using the two methods are in agreement, justifying the use of the IE method; this is advantageous because of smaller computation times, and for providing a physical insight to the scattering phenomena at hand. Anechoic chamber measurements are performed to validate the numerical results.",Drone,2019
Global Fault-Tolerant Control of Underactuated Aerial Vehicles with Redundant Actuators,"In this paper, we consider the fault-tolerant control problem for aerial vehicles with redundant actuators. The redundant actuator brings difficulty in fault identification and isolation. Active fault-tolerant control is adopted in this paper as it can detect actuator fault. The entire proposed fault-tolerant control algorithm contains a baseline controller, the fault detection and isolation scheme, and the controller reconstruction module. A robust parameter identification method is designed to identify the torque and thrust generated by the actuators. The feasibility of isolating the fault for the redundant actuators is analyzed through mathematical proof. Through the analysis, the practical fault isolation algorithm is also proposed. Two typical aerial vehicles with redundant actuators, an eight-rotor aircraft and a hexa-rotor aircraft, are adopted in numerical simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant control approach.",Drone,2019
Drone Deployment Using Coverage-and-Energy-Oriented Technique in Drone-Based Wireless Sensor Network,"Awireless sensor network utilizes small sensors with a low cost and low power being deployed over a wide area. They monitor the surrounding environment and gather the associated information to transmit it to a base station via multi-hop transmission. Most of the research has mainly focused on static sensors that are located in a fixed position. Unlike a wireless sensor network based on static sensors, we can exploit drone-based technologies for more efficient wireless networks in terms of coverage and energy. In this paper, we introduce a transmission power model and a video encoding power model to design the network environment. We also explain a priority mapping scheme, and deploy drones oriented for network coverage and energy consumption. Through our simulations, this research shows coverage and energy improvements in adrone-based wireless sensor network with fewer sensors, compared to astatic sensor-based wireless sensor network. Concretely, coverage increases by 30% for thedrone-based wireless sensor network with the same number of sensors. Moreover, we save an average of 25% with respect to the total energy consumption of the network while maintaining the coverage required.",Drone,2019

Big Data Analytics for Countermeasure System Against GPS Jamming,"Artificial intelligence is closely linked to our real lives, leading innovation in various fields. Especially, as a means of transportation possessing artificial intelligence, autonomous unmanned vehicles are actively researched and are expected to be put into practical use soon. Autonomous cars and autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles are required to equip accurate navigation system so that they can find out their present position and move to their destination. At present, the navigation of transportation that we operate is mostly dependent on GPS. However, GPS is vulnerable to external intereference. In fact, since 2010, North Korea has jammed GPS several times, causing serious disruptions to mobile communications and aircraft operations. Therefore, in order to ensure safety in the operation of the autonomous unmanned vehicles and to prevent serious accidents caused by the intereference, rapid situation judgment and countermeasure are required. In this paper, based on big data and machine learning technology, we propose a countermeasure system for GPS interference that supports decision making by applying John Boyd 's OODA loop cycle (detection - direction setting - determination ¨C action).",Drone,2019
Rotor-duct aerodynamic and acoustic interactions at low Reynolds number,"Ducted single and multi-rotor UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicle) offer better crash worthiness and safety compared to open rotor UAVs. The interactions that affect performance and acoustics are of interest. High speed stereo particle image velocimetry (SPIV), performance, and acoustic measurements were doneon a rotor with removable protective duct to study rotor-duct aerodynamic interactions over a range of hover conditions at low Reynolds number. Instantaneous and averaged SPIV velocity field and performance results, as well as acoustic signatures, are compared to baseline un-ducted rotor cases. Increase in rotor figure of merit is strongly correlated with thelevel of duct interaction with rotor tip vortex cores. Efficiency change is higher for the cases where thrust induced losses take a larger share of the overall aerodynamic losses. While theoverall acoustic sound pressure level was not affectedsignificantly, cases with higher vortex core/duct interactions showed higher tonal content.Graphical abstract[GRAPHICS].",Drone,2019
"Joint Trajectory Design, Task Data, and Computing Resource Allocations for NOMA-Based and UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing","Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been considered as a promising technique to address the explosively growing computation-intensive applications. Thanks to the flexibility of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the UAV-assisted MEC can serve mobile terminals (MTs) effectively, i.e., the computing server installed on the UAV can flexibly change its location to serve MTs. Moreover, since non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is able to accommodate massive connectivity, the NOMA-based and UAV-assisted MEC can provide flexible computing services for MTs in large-scale access networks (e.g., sensor networks and Internet of Things). However, due to the diversity of the UAV's trajectory and the interference among MTs introduced by NOMA, the performance (e.g., energy consumption and delay) of the NOMA-based and UAV-assisted MEC system is adversely affected. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the largest energy consumption among MTs by jointly optimizing the trajectory, task data and computing resource allocations, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Furthermore, to minimize the largest energy consumption among MTs with lower complexity, we propose a fixed point service scheme and optimize the location of the fixed point. The simulation results show that the proposed optimization algorithms can effectively reduce the largest energy consumption among MTs and ensure the fairness among MTs.",Drone,2019
An Adaptive Whale Optimization Algorithm Using Gaussian Distribution Strategies and Its Application in Heterogeneous UCAVs Task Allocation,"To overcome the defect of whale optimization algorithm (WOA) being easily fallen into local optimum caused by the ill-distribution of solutions, this paper explores an adaptive WOA variant using Gaussian distribution strategies (GDSs), named GDS-WOA. In GDS-WOA, by means of one GDS, named the Gaussian estimation of distribution method, the superior population information is used to evolve the distribution scope and modify the evolution direction. Moreover, an adaptive framework is adopted to integrate the Gaussian estimation of distribution method and WOA together, in which each individual can update its position using Gaussian estimation of distribution method or WOA according to an adaptive probability parameter. When the algorithm falls into stagnation, another GDS, named Gaussian random walk, is activated to enrich the population diversity and help the algorithm get rid of the local optimum. Additionally, the greedy strategy is carried out to select the offspring from the parents and the generated candidates to fully retain the promising solutions. The GDS-WOA is benchmarked on CEC 2014 test suite, and the performance of GDS-WOA is evaluated by comparing with WOA and its promising variant IWOA, as well as other five state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, i.e., COA, VCS, CoBiDE, HFPSO and GWO. The statistical results demonstrate that GDS-WOA outperforms other competitors in terms of convergence efficiency and accuracy. Finally, GDS-WOA is applied to solve the optimal task allocation problem of heterogeneous unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs). To address this constrained real-world optimizing problem efficiently, the mathematical model of heterogeneous UCAVs task allocation is described with the operational effectiveness value as the objective. The validity and practicauility of the model as well as the performance of GDS-WOA for solving constrained optimization problem are demonstrated by the experimental results.",Drone,2019
End-to-End Visual Domain Adaptation Network for Cross-Domain 3D CPS Data Retrieval,"3D CPS (Cyber Physical System) data has been widely generated and utilized for multiple applications, e.g. autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicle and so on. For large-scale 3D CPS data analysis, 3D object retrieval plays a significant role for urban perception. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end domain adaptation framework for cross-domain 3D objects retrieval (C3DOR-Net), which learns a joint embedding space for 3D objects from different domains in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we focus on the unsupervised case when 3D objects in the target domain are unlabeled. To better encode a 3D object, the proposed method learns multi-view visual features in a data-driven manner for 3D object representation. Then, the domain adaptation strategy is implemented to benefit both domain alignment and final classification. Specifically, an center-based discriminative feature learning method enables the domain invariant features with better intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. C3DOR-Net can achieve remarkable retrieval performances by maximizing the inter-class divergence and minimizing the intra-class divergence. We evaluate our method on two cross-domain protocols: 1) CAD-to-CAD object retrieval on two popular 3D datasets (NTU and PSB) in three designed cross-domain scenarios; 2) SHREC' 19 monocular image based 3D object retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly boost the cross-domain retrieval performances.",Drone,2019
Abnormal Behavior Detection Scheme of UAV Using Recurrent Neural Networks,"With the development of technology and the decreasing of manufacturing costs, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is considered to be one of the most effective relay to expand the communication coverage and improve the performance of cellular networks. However, the communication system of UAV is very susceptible to Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing, causing it to deviate from the original trajectory and perform abnormal behavior. To address this issue, the abnormal behavior detection scheme of UAV using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the reliable normal behavior models for two different scenarios are established by applying RNNs to avoid the confusion of slight offset and abnormal behavior, so as to improve the accuracy of proposed detection scheme of UAV. Besides, in order to ensure the accuracy of training samples of RNNs, Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is used to obtain a large number of current 2D arrival angle of UAV. Moreover, an appropriate threshold is selected through amounts of experiments to measure the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the real position and the position provided by normal behavior models, thus detecting the abnormal behavior of UAV. Experimental results reveal that the proposed abnormal behavior detection scheme is of high accuracy.",Drone,2019
Fast Beam Tracking Discontinuous Reception for D2D-Based UAV MmWave Communication,"The device-to-device (D2D) communication integrated with the millimeter-wave (mmWave) air interface will play a significant role in the future mobile communication in terms of high transmission rate and deployment flexibility. Meanwhile, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are promoted as D2D nodes to support D2D-enabled networks for broad coverage. In this paper, we provide a new D2D-based UAV mmWave communication framework, in which the UAVs are mobile nodes and have stringent energy constraints. Therefore, the energy-efficient technology which can turn on the UAVs' radio only when necessary and overcome the resulting easily-occurred beam misalignments due to the radio OFF periods and the aircrafts' agile mobility is required urgently. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel fast beam tracking discontinuous reception (FBT-DRX) mechanism. A new Semi-Markov model is designed to analytically investigate the statistical property of the proposed scheme. Different from many published works on DRX with beamforming, we take the impact of UAV movements into account when deriving the exact closed-form expressions of sleep ratio and average packet delay. Finally, the numerical results are supplied to evaluate the effects of different key parameters on the system performance, and demonstrate that the FBT-DRX mechanism can perform well both in power saving and packet delay in the considered framework.",Drone,2019
WEATHER THREAT ASSESSMENT BASED ON DYNAMIC BAYESIAN NETWORK,"This paper aims to ascertain the variation in weather threat over time. To this end, the author established an assessment model of weather threat based on the Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN).

The research findings shed new light on the accurate rout planning of an UAV.",Drone,2019
Research of Multi-Rotor UAVs Detailed Autonomous Inspection Technology of Transmission Lines Based on Route Planning,"With the rapid development of the economy, the scale of transmission networks has been expanding, bring higher demands and challenges on transmission line operation and maintenance. In this paper, the multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) safety inspection rules and automatic detailed inspection methods for transmission towers are studied. The theoretical model of multi-rotor UAVs of transmission lines inspection is established. The imaging calculation range of multi-rotor UAV-equipped cameras is determined. According to the inspection theory model, the flight safety judgment standard is designed, and the key parts of the transmission lines that need to be inspected are determined according to the accurate model of the transmission tower. Then the inspection waypoints are manually operated, and the photographing position and angle of each waypoint from the flight control are recorded through the waypoint planning function. Finally, the waypoints are connected in order, and the inspection route is automatically generated to achieve automatic detailed inspection. The inspection efficiency, error analysis and position accuracy comparing the proposed method with some state-of-the-art methods have been evaluated. The results show that the position error of UAVs automatic detailed inspection is less than 10 cm. The error of height is between 1.26 and 1.76 meter. Compared with the traditional manual inspection, the efficiency of multi-rotor UAVs automatic detailed inspection can be increased by 57.98%similar to 62.88% and can be applied to large-scale inspection of transmission lines.",Drone,2019

But limited by the energy density of conventional Li batteries, the battery life is short, which has become a bottleneck restricting the development of multirotor UAVs. Therefore, the power source of multirotor UAVs is urging to be improved.

Bidirectional Carouseling Method Based on Phase Difference for MEMS Gyro North Finder,"The north finder has been widely used in precision guided weapons, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other device. In this paper, a north finder based on a low-cost micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) gyro is proposed. In order to reduce the substantial bias effect on the gyro's north finding angle, a bidirectional carouscling method is applied. To improve the north finding accuracy, the phase difference between the turntable rotation rate and the gyro output is used. After the calculation of the phase difference, a five-order Butterworth filter is chosen to eliminate the gyro high-frequency noise. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method based on the phase difference can effectively improve the north finding accuracy by 50% compared with the traditional carouseling method.",Drone,2019
Time-varying formation tracking for uncertain second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems,"Our study is concerned with the time-varying formation tracking problem for second-order multi-agent systems that are subject to unknown nonlinear dynamics and external disturbance, and the states of the followers form a predefined time-varying formation while tracking the state of the leader. The total uncertainty lumps the unknown nonlinear dynamics and the external disturbance, and is regarded as an extended state of the agent. To estimate the total uncertainty, we design an extended state observer (ESO). Then we propose a novel ESO based time-varying formation tracking protocol. It is proved that, under the proposed protocol, the ESO estimation error and the time-varying formation tracking error can be made arbitrarily small. An application to the target enclosing problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) verifies the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.",Drone,2019
Active fault-tolerant tracking control of a quadrotor with model uncertainties and actuator faults,"This paper presents a reliable active fault-tolerant tracking control system (AFTTCS) for actuator faults in a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (QUAV). The proposed AFTTCS is designed based on a well-known model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework that guarantees the global asymptotic stability of a QUAV system. To mitigate the negative impacts of model uncertainties and enhance system robustness, a radial basis function neural network is incorporated into the MRAC scheme for adaptively identifying the model uncertainties online and modifying the reference model. Meanwhile, actuator dynamics are considered to avoid undesirable performance degradation. Furthermore, a fault detection and diagnosis estimator is constructed to diagnose lossof- control-effectiveness faults in actuators. Based on the fault information, a fault compensation term is added to the control law to compensate for the adverse effects of actuator faults. Simulation results show that the proposed AFTTCS enables the QUAV to track the desired reference commands in the absence/presence of actuator faults with satisfactory performance.",Drone,2019
A traffic-differentiated routing algorithm in Flying Ad Hoc Sensor Networks with SDN cluster controllers,"Recently, Flying Ad-hoc Sensor Networks (FASNETs), which are basically ad hoc networks between Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), have been playing a great role in many sensing fields. To further improve the utilization of network resources, researchers offer the possibility of applying Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology to FASNETs, enabling various applications to be supported over the same platform. Since these concurrently executed applications might have diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, it brings new challenges to network management and resource scheduling. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering FASNET architecture with SDN cluster controllers and also a collaborative controller, in order to realize hierarchical management and unified dispatch. Based on our designed architecture, we also propose a centralized traffic-differentiated routing (TDR) executed in each cluster, which aims to guarantee the specific QoS requirements of delay-sensitive and reliability-requisite services. Different weights are assigned to various flows according to their sensitivity to delay and also levels of importance. In particular, we introduce a transmission reliability prediction model to TDR, in which we consider both link availability and node's forwarding ability. Simulation results show our proposed TDR has good performances in terms of end-to-end delay, packet dropping ratio and network throughput. (C) 2017 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

UAV-Undertaker: Securely Verifiable Remote Erasure Scheme with a Countdown-Concept for UAV via Randomized Data Synchronization,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an increasingly core role in modern warfare, with powerful but tiny embedded computing systems actively applied in the military field. Confidential data, such as military secrets, may be stored inside military devices such as UAVs, and the capture or loss of such data could cause significant damage to national security. Therefore, the development of securely verifiable remote erasure techniques for military devices is considered a core technology. In this study, we devised a verifiable remote erasure scheme with a countdown-concept using randomized data synchronization to satisfy securely verifiable remote erasure technology. The scheme allows the GCS (Ground Control Station) to remotely erase data stored in the UAV, even on loss of communication, and returns proof of erasure to GCS after erasure. Our approach classifies the accumulated data stored in the UAV as a new data type and applies the characteristics of that data type to generate the proof of erasure. We select a small-volume data sample (rather than all of the data) and perform prior learning only on that sample; in this way, we can obtain the probative power of the evidence of erasure with a relatively small amount of traffic. When we want to erase data of 100 Mbytes of remote device, 100 Mbytes of data transfer is required for related work, whereas our system has data transfer according to the ratio of amount of randomly selected data. By doing this, communication stability can be acquired even in unstable communication situations where the maximum traffic can change or not be predicted. Furthermore, when the UAV sends the proof of erasure to the GCS, the UAV does its best to perform the erasure operation given its situation.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Target Search with Multiple Coordinated UAVs,"Search and tracking is the problem of locating a moving target and following it to its destination. In this work, we consider a scenario in which the target moves across a large geographical area by following a road network and the search is performed by a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We formulate search and tracking as a combinatorial optimization problem and prove that the objective function is submodular. We exploit this property to devise a greedy algorithm. Although this algorithm does not offer strong theoretical guarantees because of the presence of temporal constraints that limit the feasibility of the solutions, it presents remarkably good performance, especially when several UAVs are available for the mission. As the greedy algorithm suffers when resources are scarce, we investigate two alternative optimization techniques: Constraint Programming (CP) and AI planning. Both approaches struggle to cope with large problems, and so we strengthen them by leveraging the greedy algorithm. We use the greedy solution to warm start the CP model and to devise a domain-dependent heuristic for planning. Our extensive experimental evaluation studies the scalability of the different techniques and identifies the conditions under which one approach becomes preferable to the others.",Drone,2019
Space-track modulation and coding for high density aerial vehicle downlink networks with free space optical and visible light communications,"Aerial vehicles (AVs) have challenges in terms of realizing low complexity and wide coverage area wireless communications architectures, especially for crowded or high density groups of AVs with state-of-the-art free space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) based system designs. FSO architectures generally target point-to-point high gain directional links while requiring strict acquisition and tracking due to the narrow beam width of laser transmitters with challenges of vibration, turbulence, misalignment, atmospheric absorption, scattering, and fading. In this article, a novel multiuser free space optical system design of modulation and coding denoted by space-track modulation and coding (STMC) is proposed for crowded downlink communications. STMC does not require high accuracy tracking and costly system components by utilizing large beam divergence angles, more transmitter units with smaller aperture sizes and weights, and large spatial regions to receive modulated data at AV tracks. In addition, the spatio-optical wireless caching problem is introduced for AV networks while defining STMC problem information theoretically. STMC combines track based multiuser modulation and coding, with geographical and positional data for low data rate broadcasting applications with wide area coverage. Numerical simulations provide tens of bit/s data rates for thousands of kilometers of coverage area while simultaneously serving a significantly larger number of AVs. Finally, future works and open issues are discussed. The novel modulation and coding mechanisms are promising future applications for both high altitude AVs and low altitude drone networks with low complexity hardware for multiuser low data rate communications.",Drone,2019

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM AS THE BASIS OF AUTOMATED CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR MILITARY PURPOSES,"Geographic information system (GIS) plays a pivotal role in military operations. The concept of command, control, and coordination in military operations is largely dependent on the accuracy of spatial information necessary to take a quick decision for operational orders. In the present digital era, GIS is an excellent tool for military commanders in the operations. Especially, the creation of an automated control system of troops and weapons plays a vital role in the modern army. This system is used to process digital information, which makes it possible to coordinate the location of various types of information. The main existing technologies that are used to plan the operation and the suppression of precision weapons in the system of GIS are analyzed. The main task of the automated control system is the information interaction between subsystems included in its structure and management. Providing an interface for interacting systems also plays a vital role. The quality of an automated control system is determined by the effectiveness of the implementation of the tasks above. The prospects developments of geographic information system for military-purpose are the area of the futher research. Currently, automated control systems of troops and weapons are combined into a single coherent system of the latest technical developments of the military industry. An example of such developments is a modern high-performance and fault-tolerant computing systems, wideband radio communications, reconnaissance and combat unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), video surveillance and targeting and so on.

Brief experience of development and first results of practical use of small-sized FMCW SAR on a multicopter,"The paper presents a brief summary of the authors' experience of design and practical work with small-sized high-resolution SARs placed on small aircraft-type UAVs, and demonstration of the first results of practical radar survey of the earth and sea surface from board of a multicopter. The capabilities, composition and specifications of the SAR family are considered, the results of detailed survey of the parcels in L-, C - and X-wavelength ranges, including full polarimetric ones, are presented. The main difficulties of both scientific and engineering-practical nature, which the authors had to face during the creation of small-sized SARs, as well as the approaches used to overcome them, are considered. It is shown that the developed and improved algorithms of signal processing and radar imaging, and technology provided the possibility of creating a small-sized software SAR on a multicopter type UAV. The presented results of the experiments in the earth and sea surface surveying from the board of the DJIMatrice 600 multicopter confirm the SAR possibility of radar imaging with a resolution of up to 30 centimeters at a maximum range of up to six kilometers. The main direction of further reducing the weight-size parameters of the SAR is the design of its own antenna system, taking into account the design features of the carrier. According to forward estimates, it will reduce the total weight of the kit from two to one-one and a half kilograms, and, as a result, will provide an expansion of the list of potential SAR carriers. The obtained results allow us to consider as successful the first experiments of plane surveying with the use of multicopter as a carrier of SAR in our country and to conclude not only about the lack of lag in this respect from foreign developers, but also about some advance of them.",Drone,2019
Distributed sensor fault diagnosis for a formation of multi-vehicle systems,"In the paper, a distributed sensor fault detection and isolation scheme is presented for a network of second-order integrators. A new distributed control law is developed to achieve formation of the system. By using the integration information of distributed formation errors, the control law improves the robustness of the formation. A distributed observer is then designed in each vehicle based on the closed-loop dynamic model of the vehicle. Each vehicle updates the states of the distributed observer by employing the measurements of itself and the transmitted state estimations from its neighbors. Based on the distributed observer, a distributed fault detection observer and a distributed fault isolation observer are designed. The presented distributed fault detection observer in each vehicle is able to be sensitive to the faults of all vehicles in the system. By using the distributed fault isolation observers, each vehicle is able to be sensitive to the faults of itself, its neighbors and its neighbors' neighbors and to be robust to the faults of other vehicles. Although the fault isolation of the proposed scheme is simple, computation loads of the scheme are lower than the current ones since only the model of the individual vehicle is used. Finally, the effectiveness of the control law and the fault diagnosis scheme is demonstrated by simulations and real-time experiments carried out based on a formation of three quadrotors.

APPLICATION POSSIBILITIES OF WAVELET TRANSFORM AT DETECTION OF AREAS WITH CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES ON DATA OF EARTH REMOTE SENSING,"The detecting problem of the areas with characteristic properties on the example of the detecting problem of the areas promising from the point of view of the presence of archaeological monuments is considered in this paper. The image obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle in the near infrared range on the territory of Kushman III Settlement is used. The results of geophysical studies confirmed by excavations are used as a reference data. An image processing method based on the calculation of wavelet-features is proposed. The statistical characteristics of images obtained as a result of a two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform are calculated along the scan line in a window of size k*k and step h. The analysis of the obtained data allowed us to identify the regularity observed for a variety of images with similar properties. This regularity is that with an increase in the wavelet transform level the wavelet-feature ¡°average value of the approximation image¡± behaves differently for images of areas that are characterized by a powerful humus layer and areas that are not rich by humus. The indicator ind is used to describe this pattern. The calculation of this indicator for the entire image, by moving a window of size k*k with step h, made it possible to obtain an image showing a high level of visual correspondence to the reference data. The developed processing method was used for images of another monument - fortified settlement Guryakar. The results of the method application confirm the ability of the method to detect areas with thick layer of humus. The developed method can be used for detecting of the areas subject to more detailed geophysical and archaeological research.",Drone,2019
Modified Hough Transform in Problem of Increasing Probability of Target Detection in Electronic Surveillance Systems,"At present, the method of multi-view detection of targets becomes apparent only for targets, which approach or recede from the radiolocation station and do not change their azimuth position. In these methods the target detection is executed in the distance-survey number plane. As a rule, the real targets may have the complicated trajectories of movement, for example, unmanned aerial vehicles. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method taking into account these trajectories. In the work a modified method of the target detection using the Hough transform on the coordinate x - coordinate plane has been proposed. In this case, the target, which moves between the azimuth directions, would be detected. To determine the efficiency of the target detection using the developed method the simulation of the target detection in the MATLAB medium has been carried out.

Validation of spectral model of digital color camera for image processing in color-vision based optical correlation-extreme aircraft navigation system,"The spectral mathematical model of a digital color camera as an opto-electronic device was designed in the process of algorithms development for color optical correlation-extreme navigation system of unmanned aerial vehicles. The model includes the relative spectral camera sensitivity for three color channels (¡°red¡±, ¡°green¡± and ¡°blue¡±) and the photosensitive cell charge accumulation calibration model. Both models were successfully developed and described in the earlier publications. This paper presents integral validation of these components as a mathematical model of the device for the use in optical correlation-extreme navigation systems image processing. The additive error of such model should be less than 15-20% of the dynamic measurement range. During the experiment, a sample of 24 reference objects spectrograms was collected, and their photo was taken by the studied camera under constant lighting conditions. The decoded color coordinates of the ¡°raw¡± photo information averaged for each object and reduced to the linear scale with the radiometric calibration model were used as the reliable data generated by the camera. The spectrograms processed by the spectral sensitivity model were used as the output values of its mathematical model. The determination coef?cient R 2 was used as a mathematical model quality metric. Its value was equal to 0.98 in the worst case (for the ¡°blue¡± color channel), and the additive error distribution appeared to be close to normal. Hence the conclusion can be drawn that the model explains data variability under the impact of random factors as reliable as possible with the use of a single independent variable. The average additive error in the unit dynamic range of measurements was equal to 0.014 with a standard deviation of 0.029. Such parameters meet the advanced requirements and prove that the developed mathematical model validation is successful. Applying the developed model makes it possible to correct the color of the current images according to light spectra while the photo is taken or synthesize images of objects in the ready sample photographs of the area. The supplement of the model by spectral characteristics of the atmosphere radiation absorption and scattering gives the possibility to assess the impact of these factors on the imaging process in color optical correlation-extreme navigation systems.",Drone,2019
Synthesis of Flight Neurocontroller by Means of a Training Method Based on Genetic Algorithm,"Compact multirotor aircrafts have lots of applications, such as aerial photography and reconnaissance, surveillance etc. Real life issues like signal delays, external disturbances and changing environment conditions make autonomous navigation a challenge and cause non-linear behavior of the craft, thus making classical proportional-integral-derivative controllers not suitable for the task of providing stable control. In this paper, the method of the flight controller synthesis for the multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle on the basis of artificial neural networks with application of genetic algorithm is considered. Training with stochastic methods has certain advantages over more common methods like backpropagation. In the paper results of such neuroemulator (artificial neural network, functioning as a model of a real craft) synthesis and training are presented. Further another neural network, a neurocontroller, is synthesized. It is trained to stabilize the model of the craft and find the optimal solution using specially developed fitness function that allows to prepare the configuration of the neurocontroller by minimizing the error of the steady state angle, overshoot or rise time. Experiments show that the neurocontroller is superior to the manually tuned proportional-integral-derivative controller in a number of parameters, and the convergence of the neural network is significantly improved in comparison with training methods based on backpropagation algorithm.",Drone,2019
Hardware-Software Complex Protection of Telemetry and Telecontrol of Specialized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This article discusses the problem of creating a secure communication channel with specialized UAV. This problem is very relevant today, because an unprotected communication channel can destroy the UAV or distort data received from it. To solve this problem, an exchange protocol with the ability to protect transmitted information is required the core of this protocol is an encryption algorithm, based on which the algorithms for protecting the integrity, confidentiality and availability of the transmitted data for the UAV are implemented. The structure of the protocol for the secure exchange of information was developed. The selection of the hardware platform for the implementation of the software-hardware module of the protocol has been made. The results of cryptanalysis showed the feasibility of using an encryption algorithm in the protocol. The parameters of the protocol are determined, the protocol¡¯s configuration methodology is formulated depending on the possible data exchange channels in order to ensure the maximum permissible level of protection of the transmitted information, taking into account the characteristics of each channel. According to the results of this work, we can conclude that the proposed encryption algorithm is better resistant to cryptanalysis than other widely used algorithms.",Drone,2019
Creation of the digital elevation model with the use of unmanned aerial vehicle,"The necessary sequence of stages has been developed and the unmanned technology for creating a digital elevation model by the example of the land use of Novosibirsk region has been implemented. The technology consists of a set of stages: reconnaissance of the terrain, ? xing reference signs, satellite measurements, aerial photography ? ights, processing the results of aerial photography and the construction of digital elevation model. The technological process was signi? cantly affected by unfavorable weather conditions - low clouds, gusty wind, high air humidity. Remote sensing study with the use of unmanned aerial vehicle of the Supercam S 250 F type made it possible to create a large-scale orthophotoplan and a digital elevation model on the farm territory (M 1 : 1000). For photogrammetric processing of digital data obtained on the farm, a two-stage method of satellite determination was used. The essence of this method was to obtain a large number of satellite measurements in a static mode and further statistical processing. For statistical processing of satellite measurements, information was used on the coordinate location of two base ground stations of the Novosibirsk Region satellite network - Kochenevo and Novosibirsk. Remoteness of support points from the ground satellite station of Novosibirsk was at a distance of over 90 km. As a result of equalization calculations, the obtained average square displacement errors of the planned and high-altitude position of the support points in various test sites were under 0.02 m in the plan, and under 0.03 m by height. In the process of photogrammetric processing of the results of aerial photography with the use of unmanned aerial vehicle, the tasks of transferring the position of points on a digital image in the pixel coordinate system into the coordinate system of the area, building digital irregular (TIN, Triangulated Irregular Network) and regular (DEM, Digital Elevation Model) surface models, and based on them, textured terrain models (TTM, Textured Terrain Model) and orthophotoplans, were solved.",Drone,2019
Time-Coordinated Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm Cooperative Attack on Ground-Moving Target,"In this paper, cooperative attack control law analysis and design problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm attack on ground-moving target with time-coordinated strategies are investigated. First, the time-coordinated control problem for a single UAV is formulated, which is the foundation of solving the problem of a single UAV arriving at the desired attack position relative to ground-moving target at a specific terminal time. Then, relative motion between each UAV and ground-moving target is considered as a finite-time time-varying tracking system problem, and the difference between expected output and system output is defined as tracking error vector. The control law is obtained by linear quadratic optimal control theory to minimize the energy cost in the whole process and the tracking error at the terminal time. Besides, time-coordinated function, which is critical to coordinate terminal time among all UAVs in the UAV swarm, is proposed to model time-coordinated strategies. Finally, numerical simulations show that the proposed control law can steer UAV swarm to arrive at the desired attack positions and achieve the time-coordinated strategies effectively.",Drone,2019
Optimized Radar Waveform Parameter Design for Small Drone Detection Based on Echo Modeling and Experimental Analysis,"Monitoring small drones is significant for security requirements, but it is challenging because of small drones' low radar cross section (RCS) and hovering ability. In order to analyze the effect of radar waveform on the echo spectra and optimize the waveform design, an analytical expression of the rotor's temporal RCS is desired. Integral model, a widely used radar echo model of the rotor's temporal RCS, does not involve the electromagnetic scattering, thus it cannot be applied to all frequency bands. The method of moments (MoM) is a strictly numerical method based on the Maxwell's equations, but cannot obtain the analytical expression. Hence, this paper proposes a new method combing the integral model and MoM to model the rotor's temporal RCS in very high frequency (VHF) band. The linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal which has a high Doppler tolerance and a large gain bandwidth product is adopted in optimizing waveform parameters design. Based on the new method, the analytical expression of LFM echo is also derived. Moreover, the spectral spread over range and Doppler dimension caused by the rotating rotors is analyzed in detail. A criterion for optimizing the LFM waveform parameters for small drone detection is presented. Field experiments confirm the validity of the echo model and waveform parameters optimization criterion, and the full Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene small drone is successfully detected in VHF band. In addition, experiments are implemented to verify the applicability of the echo model and waveform parameters optimization method to other drones with different size.",Drone,2019
Joint 3D UAV Placement and Resource Allocation in Software-Defined Cellular Networks With Wireless Backhaul,"Cellular networks assisted by flexibly placed high-maneuverability unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted virtual interests recently. In this paper, the utility maximization problem is investigated to determine how to improve the performance of multi-UAV enabled software-defined cellular networks (SDCNs) with wireless backhaul. The formulated problem jointly optimizes the three dimensional (3D) UAV placement, user scheduling and association, and spectrum resource allocation. The proposed problem is intractable since it is a mixed-integer combined non-convex problem. Thus, an efficient distributed alternating maximization (AM) iterative algorithm is developed to solve the proposed problem. Then, the original optimization problem is decomposed into three subproblems that are solved alternatively via the successive convex optimization (SCO) technique and the modified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in the proposed algorithm. The theoretical analysis and the simulation results confirm the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm. The extensive numerical results substantiate the superiority of the proposed algorithm, which significantly increases the throughput and utility of the overall users relative to the traditional overlaid ground base station (GBS) and UAV structure and other benchmark methods. The maximal throughput gain is as large as 74.9% on average for all users, in contrast to other benchmark schemes.",Drone,2019
Enhanced Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Virtual Angular Accelerometer,"The small unmanned aerial vehicles are susceptible to wind disturbances due to the turbulent environment at their low operational altitude. Compared to conventional IMU output, the phase-advanced information provided by angular acceleration measurement is more beneficial for flight stability. This paper presents a general and systematic approach to enhance the attitude stability of small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The methodology begins by designing a virtual angular accelerometer (VAA), which is based on 4 MEMS IMUs measurement fusion. Then, the angular acceleration is exploited to estimate and compensate disturbances. Finally, an enhanced attitude control scheme is developed to improve attitude tracking performance, where linear or nonlinear control approaches can be adopted. A VAA-based backstepping controller (BS) is designed and its stability is analyzed via Lyapunov function. Three simulation cases are carried out to verify the performance of tracking accuracy, robustness, and disturbance rejection. PID and backstepping methods are applied to the scheme. As a comparison, a widely used nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO)-based robust controller (RC) is studied. The simulation results show the excellent performance of the sensor-based VAA to observe the fast time-varying disturbance, where the NDO causes the time delay and phase lag. The tracking accuracy of the enhanced controllers (PID+VAA, BS+VAA, and RC+VAA), compared to the basic controllers, are improved by 14.3%-93.7% and the closed-loop control systems gain notable robustness.",Drone,2019
An ICI Suppression Analysis Testbed for Harbor Unmanned Ground Vehicle Deployment,"In recent years, intelligent transport system (ITS) applications with unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) have increased dramatically to improve the safety, efficiency, and unique services in low-to medium-range communication deployment. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is adopted as a modulation scheme for this communication system to combat fading. Unfortunately, because of possible high UGV speed, the orthogonality between subcarriers in OFDM signals is prone to intercarrier interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler spread. This paper discusses ICI suppression analysis using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) N210 under several Harbor transmission scenarios. Such communication links may contain line of sight (LoS) components in transmission. The channel is thus modeled as the well-known fast time varying path loss model. Furthermore, this paper derives the signal to interference ratio (SIR) and evaluates this parameter for several types of fading and Doppler spread shapes in UGV channels. Additionally, the paper presents a practical method for calculating the spectral efficiency of OFDM systems, with an example for actual implementation in UGV systems. Eventually, the testbed results indicate that the SIR will decrease if the maximum Doppler spread expands. In the Rician channel, it can be seen that the SIR depends on the maximum Doppler speed, the angle of arrival (AoA), and even the Rician element of the LoS component.",Drone,2019
Distributed Conflict-Detection and Resolution Algorithm for UAV Swarms Based on Consensus Algorithm and Strategy Coordination,"In this paper, we study the problem of conflict detection and resolution for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms. Specially, we propose a distributed conflict detection and resolution method for multi-UAVs in formation based on consensus algorithm and strategy coordination. When encountering threat swarms, the UAVs in one swarm act as one unit and are together treated as one control object. Each swarm in conflict selects three candidate collision avoidance maneuvers from the preset strategy pool, generates the corresponding planned trajectories with an uncertainty trajectory modeling, and then broadcasts and shares them. All of the swarms in conflict coordinate and determine an optimal combination of strategies. When a collision is imminent, the primary strategy is activated. Each swarm adopts a ""leader- follower'' strategy, where the leader UAV is regarded as the controller and flies independently, and the others follow the leader UAV. During motion, a decentralized consensus algorithm is adopted for agents to converge to their positions for the desired formation and to maintain a stable geometric configuration. A temporal and spatially integrated conflict-detection model is improved, especially for UAV swarms. A token-allocation strategy is especially improved for distributed coordination to resolve the partial knowledge of the airspace condition. Damping of the coordination is proposed to address data dropouts and transmission delays. Two typical scenarios are conducted to test the methodology proposed in this paper. The simulation result demonstrates the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed methodology.",Drone,2019
Medium Access Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Based Mission Critical Wireless Sensor Networks in 3D Monitoring Networks,"In this paper, a novel medium access control (MAC) layer protocol is introduced for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based mission critical wireless sensor networks (MC-WSN), which is an important application of mission critical sensor and sensor networks (MC-SSN). The UAVs hovering in the three-dimensional monitoring networks are distributed in subsets according to their distance from the center station. UAVs in the same subset are contending for access and transmission, while each subset is allotted a slot based on adaptive time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme. As a multi-channel system, a novel channel allocation algorithm is presented for subset relay transmission period to optimize the performance of networks. The UAV returning period for charging is utilized in the protocol to enhance the transmission throughput and mitigate delay. Detection slot and position prediction algorithm are designed in the UAV returning period to improve the throughput and reduce the delay. The simulation results verify the improvement on throughput and delays of the proposed protocol for UAV-based MC-WSN.",Drone,2019
Grid-Based Exclusive Region Design for 3D UAV Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach,"This paper presents a stochastic geometry analysis of radio interference and a grid-based design of a primary exclusive region (PER) for spectrum sharing in the 3D unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. When a UAV network shares frequency bands with a primary system (e.g., a weather radar system), the UAVs must avoid harmful interference with the primary system. To facilitate the design of a complex-shaped PER according to a primary user's antenna pattern, spatial grid models, namely cylindrical and cubic grid models, are introduced. In the cylindrical grid model, to approximate the distribution of the interference at the radar, the cumulants of the interference are expressed by expressions with simple integrals or even closed-form expressions based on the assumption that the distributions of the UAVs in each grid cell follow an inhomogeneous 3D Poisson point process (PPP). In the cubic grid model, the shape of the grid cell is approximated by the cylindrical grid cell to derive the cumulants of the interference because they cannot be calculated in the same manner as in the cylindrical grid model. Using the derived interference cumulants to determine a PER to satisfy the radar's outage probability target, an optimization problem that minimizes the number of the UAVs forbidden from transmitting signals is formulated. The numerical results confirm that the approximated interference distribution using cumulants is in acceptable agreement with the simulation results and the PER obtained from the proposed optimization problem improves the number of the transmitting UAVs by reducing the volume of grid cells.",Drone,2019
"Detection, Tracking, and Geolocation of Moving Vehicle From UAV Using Monocular Camera","Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in urban traffic supervision in recent years. However, the detection, tracking, and geolocation of moving vehicle based on the airborne platform suffer from small object sizes, complex scenes, and low-accuracy sensors. To address these problems, this paper develops a framework for moving vehicle detecting, tracking, and geolocating based on a monocular camera, a GPS receiver, and inertial measurement units (IMUs) sensors. First, the method based on YOLOv3 was employed for vehicle detection due to its effectiveness and efficiency for small object detection in complex scenes. Then, a visual tracking method based on correlation filters is introduced, and a passive geolocation method is presented to calculate the GPS coordinates of the moving vehicle. Finally, a flight control method in terms of the previous image processing results is introduced to lead the UAV that is following the interesting moving vehicle. The proposed scheme has been built on a DJI M100 platform on which a monocular camera and a microcomputer Jetson TX1 are added. The experimental results show that this scheme is capable of detecting, tracking, and geolocating the interesting moving vehicle with high precision. The framework demonstrates its capacity in automatic supervision on target vehicles in real-world experiments, which suggests its potential applications in urban traffic, logistics, and security.",Drone,2019
Interference Management in UAV-Assisted Integrated Access and Backhaul Cellular Networks,"An integrated access and backhaul (IAB) network architecture can enable flexible and fast deployment of the next-generation cellular networks. However, mutual interference between access and backhaul links, small inter-site distance, and spatial dynamics of user distribution pose major challenges in the practical deployment of the IAB networks. To tackle these problems, we leverage the flying capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as hovering IAB-nodes and propose an interference management algorithm to maximize the overall sum rate of the IAB network. In particular, we jointly optimize the user and base station associations, the downlink power allocations for access and backhaul transmissions, and the spatial configurations of the UAVs. We consider two spatial configuration modes of the UAVs, distributed UAVs and drone antenna array (DAA), and show how they are intertwined with the spatial distribution of ground users. Our numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves an average of 2.9 x and 6.7 x gains in the received downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and overall network sum rate, respectively. Finally, the numerical results reveal that UAVs can not only be used for coverage improvement but also for capacity boosting in the IAB cellular networks.",Drone,2019
A Study on the Object-based Building Extraction Using UAV Imagery,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can provide the ability to monitor urban areas efficiently in very fine detail. Building extraction is a major topic in urban monitoring that can be used to update maps, detect illegal buildings, create 3D city models. This study proposes an object-based building extraction method using only RGB images of UAV. Object-based approaches can be more effective at UAV image processing, because pixel-based or edge-based analysis can prove insufficient for high-resolution imagery due to its inability to handle the internal variability of complex scenes. First, objects are generated from an orthoimage and DSM using a multiresolution segmentation technique. Segmented objects are then separated by the DSM into high objects such as buildings or trees and low objects such as roads and the ground. High objects are classified as either buildings or non-buildings using spectral indices such as the normalized excessive green index (nEGI) and spatial features. The final buildings are generated by region-growing adjacent objects that are classified as buildings. This method¡¯s usability was evaluated by performing experiments with various UAV images.",Drone,2019
Measurement-Based Characterization and Modeling for Low-Altitude UAV Air-to-Air Channels,"In this paper, we characterize the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) air-to-air (A2A) channel for an 802.11-based low altitude network based on a preliminary measuring result over user datagram protocol (UDP) throughput, latency, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and pack loss, via various field experiments. Latency and pack loss are strongly related to the stability of flight; while the UDP throughput and RSSI shows a related variation trend in terms of the communication distance and altitude. A modified model based on the classical log-distance path loss (PL) model is introduced to describe propagation path loss, demonstrating the decreasing trend of multi-path effect and shadow fading with an increase in altitude. The simulation work is done to specifically show the characterization of A2A channels based on UAVs in short distance and low altitude environment.",Drone,2019
Routing Protocols for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks: A Survey,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity for diverse applications and services in both the military and civilian domains. For cooperation and collaboration among UAVs, they can be wirelessly interconnected in an ad hoc manner, resulting in a UAV network. UAV networks have unique features and characteristics that are different from mobile ad hoc networks and vehicular ad hoc networks. The dynamic behavior of rapid mobility and topology changes in UAV networks makes the design of a routing protocol quite challenging. In this paper, we review the routing protocols for UAV networks, in which the topology-based, position-based, hierarchical, deterministic, stochastic, and social-network-based routing protocols are extensively surveyed. The routing protocols are then compared qualitatively in terms of their major features, characteristics, and performance.

Towards an Ontology Design Pattern for UAV Video Content Analysis,"Video scene understanding is leading to an increased research investment in developing artificial intelligence technologies, pattern recognition, and computer vision, especially with the advance in sensor technologies. Developing autonomous unmanned vehicles, able to recognize not just targets appearing in a scene but a complete scene the targets are involved in (describing events, actions, situations, etc.) is becoming crucial in the recent advanced intelligent surveillance systems. At the same time, besides these consolidated technologies, the Semantic Web Technologies are also emerging, yielding seamless support to the high-level understanding of the scenes. To this purpose, the paper proposes a systematic ontology modeling to support and improve video content analysis, by generating a comprehensive high-level scene description, achieved by semantic reasoning and querying. The ontology schema comes from as an integration of new and existing ontologies and provides some design pattern guideline to get a high-level description of a whole scenario. It starts from the description of basic targets in the video scenario, thanks to the support of video tracking algorithms and target classification; then provides a higher level interpretation, compounding event-driven target interactions (for local activity comprehension), to reach gradually an abstraction high level that enables a concise and complete scenario description.",Drone,2019
Function Chain-Based Mission Planning Method for Hybrid Combat SoS,"With the development of unmanned equipment technology, new types of intelligent weapons such as loitering missile and unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) are widely used. The combat system of systems (SoS) presents the characteristics of multifunctional combat equipment and hybrid manned and unmanned force units. At present, the research of mission planning is mostly oriented to a single factor, does not consider a variety of operational activities. Therefore, how to describe the hybrid operational organization of multiple functions and force units and to accomplish mission planning for various operational activities has very practical significance. In this paper, the FINC(Force, Intelligence, Networking, C2) model is extended, a new model framework of unmanned combat force with the function of integrated observe and attack is proposed, which is called Force Intelligent Network Command and Control Model with autonomous platform (FINCA). Four types and eight different function chains are proposed for the hybrid Combat SoS. Through the capability requirements and resource constraints, the operational tasks are mapped to the types and quantities of function chains that needed to accomplish this task, and the multi-priority list dynamic reconstruction scheme (MPLDCS) method is used to generate the function chain planning scheme. The many-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-III is improved, let mission execution time, connection change induced consumption, and the real-time remaining number of UAV composed the objective function to find all possible Pareto front. Finally, the method proposed in this paper was validated by the case of the modular and reconfigurable fire brigade proposed by the US.Army to participate in the border operations.",Drone,2019
Reconnaissance Mission Conducted by UAV Swarms Based on Distributed PSO Path Planning Algorithms,"Reconnaissance mission has a wide application in both civil and military fields, which provides intelligence and basis for the following decision-making to accomplish certain goals. Due to numerous advantages of UAV swarms such as strong flexibility, high efficiency, and low cost, conducting reconnaissance missions by UAV swarms has become a trend of future. However, the path planning problem of UAV swarms is a key challenge in the aspect of model construction, algorithm, selection and high computational complexity, especially when the mission is complicated. In this paper, various distributed particle swarm optimization (DPSO)-based path planning algorithms are proposed for UAV swarms conducting a reconnaissance mission, in which targets are gathered in the form of clusters and different tactic needs are taken into consideration. Three algorithms named the maximum density convergence DPSO algorithm (MDC-DPSO), the fast cross-over DPSO algorithm (FCO-DPSO), and the accurate coverage exploration DPSO algorithm (ACE-DPSO) are proposed correspond to the needs of fast convergence, random crossover, and accurate search, respectively. Different fitness functions and search strategies are specifically designed considering the mobility and communication constraints of the UAV swarms. Besides, the jump-out mechanism and revisit mechanism are designed to save invalid search efforts and avoid falling into local optimum. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are effective in generating paths for UAV swarms conducting a reconnaissance mission, which can be easily applied to large scale swarms.",Drone,2019
Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Operators Based on Reconnaissance Plane With Multiple Array Sensors,"For the sake of positioning the illegal unmanned aerial vehicle operators, the paper proposes a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm based on the reconnaissance plane with multiple array sensors. First, the number of unmanned aerial vehicle signals is determined by information theory criteria. Then combined support vector regression, the direction of the operator is calculated according to some approximating function through training. Finally, the location can be estimated by integrating the DOAs acquired with the array sensors on the reconnaissance aircraft. This algorithm is convenient and fast to be realized, moreover, as a result of adopting super resolution and multiple kernel learning, it can locate numerous radio signals simultaneously and performs well in the circumstance that signals impinge on the sensor array with small-angle interval, as well as the conditions of small samples and low signal to noise ratio, besides, the algorithm also applies to the array which gain-phase inconsistency exists among the sensors.",Drone,2019
UAV Path Planning for ISR Mission and Survivability,"In an complicated battlefield environment, information from enemy's camp is an important factor in carrying out military operations. For obtaining this information, the number of UAVs that can be deployed to the mission without our forces' loss and at low cost is increasing. Because the mission environment has anti-aircraft weapons, mission space is needed for UAV to guarantee survivability without being killed. The concept of Configuration Space is used to define the mission space considering with range of weapons and detect range of UAV. UAV must visit whole given area to obtain the information and perform Coverage Path Planning for this. Based on threats to UAV and importance of information that will be obtained, area that UAV should visit first is defined. Grid Map is generated and mapping threat information to each grid for UAV path planning. On this study, coverage conditions and path planning procedures are presented based on the threat information on Grid Map, and mission space is expanded to improve detection efficiency.

"A Study on Terrorism using Unmanned Aerial System, Its Response and Future Extensions","This study presents aspects of Drone Terrorism, regarding information, and responses. First of all, this introduces individual terror cases. Next, terrorist groups which have used unmanned aircraft system(UAS) are analyzed. With given analysis, this paper deals with its current response and future extensions by technical and institutional aspects.Nowadays, Terrorism which uses innovative aircraft system is the accumulated outputs rather than a new threat. In details, UAS has been used from 1993 Aum Shinrikyo incidents to 2018 Venezuela President assassination attempt. In this sense, many terrorists such as Hezbollah, Hamas, and ISIS have utilized UAS as a terror tool. At the beginning of drone usage, most trials ended failures but current President Maduro assassination seemed almost successful. However, many countries including South Korea deal with UAS as only innovative technology, not terror threats. Under these circumstances, there is the legal contradiction between the radio law, the safety of aircraft operation act and anti-terrorism act. This article points this limit and absurdity.

Analysis of Micro-Motion Characteristics Caused by Maneuvering a Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Acquired from X-Band Radar,"Recently, feature analysis of micro-motion characteristics has been being actively studied for detecting and classifying small unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). However, small UAVs have translational motion(TM) as well as micro-motion in practical environments.Radar line of sight(LOS) can also be different for the position of a small UAV. The TM and LOS components cause changes of micro-motion properties, necessitating study on the effects of the TM and LOS on the micro-motion signal.

Prediction of Aerodynamic Noise Radiated from a Small Multicopter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle using Acoustic Analogy,"The rotor interaction phenomenon occurs frequently in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with multi-rotor configuration. In this study, we investigated the rotor interaction effects of a small-size quadcopter UAV on the aerodynamic performance and acoustic characteristics. The numerical simulation of DJI Phantom 2 model in the hover flight condition was conducted using the nonlinear vortex lattice method (NVLM) with the vortex particle method (VPM) and acoustic analogy based on the Farassat-1A formula. NVLM can consider the nonlinear aerodynamic characteristics that are mainly associated with viscous and low Reynolds number effects by incorporating airfoil look-up table and vortex strength correction. VPM is well suitable for simulating complex wake structures of quadcopter UAV because maintaining the connectivity between adjacent vortex particles is not required. Calculations for an isolated rotor were compared against measurements to validate the predicted results, including thrust force and tonal noise at 1st blade passing frequency (BPF). The calculations for a quadcopter configuration show that the average thrust coefficient decreases and thrust coefficient begins to fluctuate dramatically due to severe rotor interaction. In addition, the sound pressure level of the quadcopter is much higher than that of the isolated rotor and a significant difference in noise directivity between the quadcopter and isolated rotor is clearly captured. It is observed that unsteady loading introduced by rotor interaction leads to a considerable increase in noise. This study is a preliminary study to the aeroacoustic problem in multicopter UAV. The discussion in this work gives scope for further research on noise reductions of multicopter UAV by controlling a separation distance between the rotors.",Drone,2019
UAV-Aided Secure Transmission in MISOME Wiretap Channels With Imperfect CSI,"In this paper, we study secure cooperative transmission for the multiple-input-single-output multiple-eavesdropper (MISOME) systems, where a source (Alice) aims to send confidential messages to a legitimate user (Bob) with the aid of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled friendly jammer (Charlie) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). To further guarantee the secrecy performance, artificial noise (AN) beamforming together with cooperative Jamming (CJ) has been utilized in this considered system with only location and statistical channel state information of the Eves. Specifically, taking imperfect channel state information (CSI) between Charlie and Bob into account, we derive the exact closed-form expression of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and develop an efficient scheme to solve the secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem which has been verified as a convex one under certain SOP. Moreover, we propose an optimal UAV placement strategy to further enhance secrecy performance. The numerical results are provided to validate that the system security would seriously degenerate with channel uncertainty. Besides, the proposed scheme is verified to outperform the terrestrial CJ scheme in improving the secrecy rate and secure energy efficiency (EE) performance under perfect CSI or tolerable channel estimation errors. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed UAV placement strategy in enhancing transmission security and the applicability of the proposed scheme has also been demonstrated.",Drone,2019
NUMERICAL SIMULATION AND EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF THE DEPOSITION CONCENTRATION OF AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE,"To analyze the droplet deposition under the influence of the flow field of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a hand-held three-dimensional (3D) laser scanner was used to scan 3D images of the UAV. Fluent software was used to simulate the motion characteristics of droplets and flow fields under the conditions of a flight speed of 3 m/s and an altitude of 1.5 m. The results indicated that the ground deposition concentration in the nonrotor flow field was high, the spray field width was 2.6 m, and the droplet deposition concentration was 50 to 200 ug/cm(2). Under the influence of the rotor flow field, the widest deposition range of droplets reached 12.8 m. Notably, the droplet deposition uniformity worsened, and the concentration range of the droplet deposition was 0 to 500 ug/cm(2). With the downward development of the downwash flow field, the overall velocity of the flow field gradually decreased, and the influence interval of the flow field gradually expanded. In this article, the droplet concentration was verified under simulated working conditions by a field experiment, thereby demonstrating the reliability of the numerical simulation results. This research could provide a basis for determining optimal UAV operating parameters, reducing the drift of droplets and increasing the utilization rate of pesticides.",Drone,2019
Automated co-registration and calibration in SfM photogrammetry for landslide change detection,"Landslides represent hazardous phenomena, often with significant implications. Monitoring landslides with time-series surface observations can indicate surface failure. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) employing compact digital cameras, in conjunction with structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) image processing approaches, have become commonplace in the geoscience research community. These methods offer relatively low-cost, flexible solutions for many geomorphological monitoring applications. However, conventionally ground control points (GCPs) are required for registration purposes, the provision of which is often expensive, difficult or even impracticable in hazardous and inaccessible terrain. In an attempt to overcome the reliance on GCPs, this paper reports research that has developed a morphology-based strategy to co-register multi-temporal UAV-derived products. It applies the attribute of curvature in combination with the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm, to generate time-invariant curvature features, which serve as pseudo-GCPs. Openness, a surface morphological digital elevation model derivative, is applied to identify relatively stable ground regions from which pseudo-GCPs are selected. A sensitivity threshold quantifies the minimum detectable change alongside unresolved biases and misalignment errors. The approach is evaluated at two study sites in the UK, first at Sandford with artificially induced surface change, and second at an active landslide at Hollin Hill, with multi-epoch SfM-MVS products derived from a consumer-grade UAV. Elevation changes and annual displacement rates at dm-level are estimated, with optimal results achieved over winter periods. The morphology-based co-registration strategy resulted in relative error ratios (i.e. mean error divided by average flying height) in the range 1:800-2500, comparable with those reported by similar studies conducted with UAVs augmented with real time kinematic (RTK)-Global Navigation Satellite Systems. Analysis demonstrates the potential of the morphology-based strategy for a semi-automatic, and practical co-registration approach to quantify surface motion. This can ultimately complement geotechnical and geophysical investigations and support the understanding of landslide behaviour, model prediction and construction of measures for mitigating risks.

A PSO-Based Approach for User-Pairing Schemes in NOMA Systems: Theory and Applications,"This paper proposes an exhaustive analysis of a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based configuration applied in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems in order to perform user aggregation along different sub-channels. The idea behind this is to highlight the main characteristics of this PSO-based configuration for understanding how this policy enables the transmitter to require the minimum downlink transmitting power while guaranteeing the quality-of-service (QoS) constraint of each user. The analysis is carried out for two representative power-constrained scenarios, i.e., disaster relief network communications and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, in which performing low-power transmissions represent an important aspect. Our results find applicability in the definition of explicit channel-state-aware strategies for user multiplexing in NOMA systems, which, at the date, represents a research field that remains to be investigated more in depth. Insightful discussions are provided from our analysis. For instance, depending on the number of available sub-channels and the channel gains experienced by each users along with the whole available bandwidth, it is shown how users must be multiplexed by the transmitter in order to reach the minimum transmitting power.",Drone,2019
Cooperative Jamming for Secure UAV Communications With Partial Eavesdropper Information,"The broadcast nature of air-to-ground line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channel imposes a great challenge in secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. To address this issue, this paper investigates UAV-ground communications from the physical-layer security perspective. Specifically, the investigated scenario includes a UAV serving as the base station (BS) that transmits confidential signals to a legitimate ground user, and there are multiple eavesdroppers on the ground with unknown position information. To further enhance the secrecy performance of the UAV-ground communications, an idle UAV can be employed to serve as a friendly jammer, which can transmit jamming signals to confuse the eavesdroppers. In our proposed strategy, the flying trajectory and the transmit power for both the UAVs are jointly optimized by maximizing the worst-case secrecy rate (WCSR) of the system. Considering the intractability of the formulated non-convex problem, we further provide a block coordinate descent-based iterative optimization method. Simulations verify that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the average WCSR in comparison with the existing works.",Drone,2019
Massive MIMO for Connectivity With Drones: Case Studies and Future Directions,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, are proliferating. Applications, such as surveillance, disaster management, and drone racing, place high requirements on the communication with the drones in terms of throughput, reliability, and latency. The existing wireless technologies, notably Wi-Fi, that are currently used for drone connectivity are limited to short ranges and low-mobility situations. New, scalable technology is needed to meet future demands on long connectivity ranges, support for fast-moving drones, and the possibility to simultaneously communicate with entire swarms of drones. Massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO), the main technology component of emerging 5G standards, has the potential to meet these requirements.",Drone,2019
Maintenance grouping optimization with system multi-level information based on BN lifetime prediction model,"Group maintenance for multi-level systems is necessary to ensure task success and system safety. However, many group maintenance models, which only consider the health of components without regard for reliability information at system-level, have difficulty meeting the increasing system task-performance demands. Based on system multi-level information, an age-based group maintenance method that trades off cost and system reliability is proposed. The method considers different failure mechanisms of units and system structures, and achieves a grouping strategy and maintenance decision-making approach according to multi-level lifetime prediction data. The reliability information at system- level is predicted by Bayesian network (BN) from life information of units, and multi-objective programming of cost and system reliability is used to optimize maintenance grouping strategies. This method is applicable to multi-level systems of varying sizes. A simulation example and a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) application illustrate the method. The results verify the feasibility and superiority, and meet the high security and reliability standards.",Drone,2019
SINGLE TREE THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL CONSTRUCTION AND IMPACT FACTOR EXTRACTION BASED ON OBLIQUE PHOTOGRAMMETRY,"Based on the digital photogrammetry principle and the computer vision theory, this paper utilizes Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) oblique photogrammetry technology to construct vegetation canopy structure three-dimensional model and to extract three-dimensional model impact factor by conducting image data orientation, matching and aerial triangulation. In order to verify whether the extraction factor is correct, this paper adopts vegetation point cloud data which are obtained from three-dimensional laser scanning. Combined with the actual case analysis, the results of the analysis show that the factor data extracted from the model are reliable.",Drone,2019
Fast convergence to Nash equilibria without steady-state oscillation,"The problem of fast convergence to Nash equilibrium without steady state oscillation in static noncooperative games with N players is considered in this paper. In this regard, players can generate their actions to achieve Nash equilibrium only by measuring their own payoff values, which means that the players do not need any information about the details of payoff function or other players' actions. Additionally, in contrast to the most classical extremum seeking algorithms, this algorithm can converge to Nash equilibria without steady state oscillation and faster, because the amplitude of excitation sinusoidal signal in the conventional extremum seeking is adjusted to converge to zero, so the deleterious effects of steady state oscillation will be eliminated. Moreover, since each player can possess a dynamic, the actions are filtered before applying to the payoff function, which can make this algorithm appealing to many applications such as mobile sensor networks. In addition, the details of convergence to Nash equilibria are provided. Finally, we illustrate the application of this algorithm to solve the formation control problem of non-holonomic unicycles, and evasion of jammer attacks on unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), which clearly shows the effectiveness and superiority of this algorithm through simulation results.

Trajectory Planning for Reconnaissance Mission Based on Fair-Energy UAVs Cooperation,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently received growing popularity in reconnaissance missions due to their many advantages, such as high mobility, flexible deployment, and low operational costs. In this paper, we investigate how the UAVs should optimally exploit its mobility via trajectory planning to achieve the fairness of energy consumption with communication, hovering, and motion energy consumption in consideration. Most of the current works only consider motion energy consumption; however, communication and hovering energy consumption cannot be ignored. We first formulate this problem as a min-max tour cover problem that has been proved to be NP-hard. Then, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to minimize the maximum energy consumption of the reconnaissance UAVs by planning the trajectories. Next, to guarantee the fairness of energy consumption under scenarios with strict and firm energy requirements, we propose an approximation algorithm that can achieve an approximation ratio of 2.5. Finally, the extensive simulations are conducted under different settings to evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms. The results show that the algorithms can improve the fairness of energy consumption and reduce the maximum energy consumption compared with other algorithms.",Drone,2019
Robust H-infinity/S-plane Controller of Longitudinal Control for UAVs,"In order to resolve the external disturbances and model parameters uncertainty during the unmanned aerial vehicles flight process, in this paper, we designed the H infinity/S-plane controller for longitudinal control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The S-plane control model with strong nonlinearity was used as the outer loop controller and the robust H infinity control algorithm with strong robustness was used as the inner loop controller. The effectiveness of the H infinity/S-plane controller in the longitudinal control of unmanned aerial vehicles without external interference, with external interference and parameter perturbation, was simulated by a certain UAVs nominal model. The results showed that compared with H infinity/PD controller and PID controller, H infinity/S-plane controller has faster response speed and stronger anti-interference ability. So H infinity/S-plane controller is more suitable for the longitudinal control of unmanned aerial vehicles than H infinity/PD controller and PID controller.",Drone,2019
UAV Image High Fidelity Compression Algorithm Based on Generative Adversarial Networks Under Complex Disaster Conditions,"This paper proposes an improved image high fidelity compression algorithm based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs) to deal with the problem that the UAV image has a large amount of data which is not conducive to post-processing. By adding an encoder in front of the generator, the disaster area image transmitted by UAV is compressed to meet the requirements of the generator. After the compressed image is trained together with the real image through the discriminator, the quality of the compressed image is constantly improved. This image compression algorithm can fully synthesize the codes of non-major areas such as trees and rivers in the image, and try to retain the codes of important areas such as houses and roads. The experimental results show that the proposed compression method in this paper has a higher compression ratio than the traditional compression method for the disaster area image, and can obtain images with strong sense of hierarchy.",Drone,2019
Precise Geometric Correction and Robust Mosaicking for Airborne Lightweight Optical Butting Infrared Imaging System,"In view of the urgent need for high-resolution and high-precision infrared image data for geological environmental monitoring, we have developed a lightweight optical butting infrared imaging system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to obtain infrared image data. In this paper, we proposed a robust mosaicking method combination of as-projective-as-possible warps and similarity transformation, which uses multiple images to generate a wide viewing field panorama. It is developed based on an analysis of projective transformation and similarity transformation. The proposed method simultaneously takes into consideration the flexibility of alignment and the preservation of image shapes. On the overlapping regions, it performs as-projective-as-possible warps. On the non-overlapping regions, it gradually becomes a similarity warp. The results show that the proposed method weakens the ""ghosting,'' shape distortion, and area distortion.",Drone,2019
An Actuator Fault Detection and Reconstruction Scheme for Hex-Rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"The detection and the reconstruction of actuator faults in a fiight control system are crucial to avoid negative impacts on the aircraft itself, as well as human and environmental systems. In this paper, an actuator fault detection and reconstruction scheme based on fault classification for the hex-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle are designed. First, the fault type of actuator is analyzed and classified, then an actuator fault model is established based on multiple fault classification. Second, a fault detection and reconstruction (FDR) scheme for the hex-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle is proposed. In the proposed scheme, a fault observer group based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed for fault detection and isolation, and the fiight state feedback required by the fault observer group is provided by the multi-sensor navigation unit (MSNU). Then, a fault reconstruction algorithm of the actuator is proposed by using the output of the fault observer group. The designed FDR system is applied to hex-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle prototype for its evaluation. The simulation results show that the proposed design is capable of fault detection and the reconstruction of actuator faults, and the actual flight verifies the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",Drone,2019
JUNCTION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS WITH THE HELP OF AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (VISTRO-AIMSUN-VISSIM),"In traffic engineering practices, there is a requirement for conducting a healthy vehicle count in order to determine concepts such as macroscopicmesoscopic-microscopic-hybrid modelling, signal and junction optimization and design, transportation plan, traffic effect and corridor analyses, and delay. With the purpose of solving the problem that is encountered in traffic counting at peak hours, an image processing software was developed with a new approach, and the video images that were shot by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were digitally transferred to the Excel environment by being processed by this software. It was achieved to make traffic counting easier from the traffic that separated from the arms on the junction, and by automated transfer of these data into the computer environment, time savings were achieved. The traffic data of the arms of the junctions were transferred to the Excel environment with 2.84% error rate, they were analysed by the VISTRO, VISSIM and AIMSUN software to produce four different scenarios, and junction performances were compared by establishing models. When the scenarios were compared, the worst performance in terms of queue length, v/c, levels-of-service and delays was obtained in Scenario 3. When the geometries of junctions were taken as without an island, signalled, two-way two-phase controlled, performance dropped. The VISSIM software provided more realistic results in comparison to the other two.",Drone,2019
Analyzing Competition and Cooperation Dynamics of the Aerial mmweve Access Market,"Cellular operators have always relied on static deployments for providing wireless access. However, even the emerging fifth-generation (5G) networks may face difficulty in supporting the increased traffic demand with a rigid, fixed infrastructure without substantial over-provisioning. This is particularly true for spontaneous large-scale events that require service providers to augment the capacity of their networks quickly. Today, the use of aerial devices equipped with high-rate radio access capabilities has the potential to offer the much needed ""on-demand"" capacity boost. Conversely, it also threatens to rattle the long-standing business strategies of wireless operators, especially as the ""gold rush"" for cheaper millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum lowers the market entry barriers. However, the intricate structure of this new market presently remains a mystery. This paper sheds light on competition and cooperation behavior of dissimilar aerial mmWave access suppliers, concurrently employing licensed and license-exempt frequency bands, by modeling a vertically differentiated market where customers have varying preferences in price and quality. To understand viable service provider strategies, we begin by constructing the Nash equilibrium for the initial market competition by employing the Bertrand and Cournot games. We then conduct a unique assessment of short-term market dynamics, where licensed-band service providers may cooperate to improve their competitive positions against the unlicensed-band counterparts intruding on the market. Our analysis studies the effects of various market interactions, price-driven demand evolution, and dynamic profit balance in this novel type of ecosystem.",Drone,2019
Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVlink) in a Nutshell: A Survey,"The micro air vehicle link (MAVLink in short) is a communication protocol for unmanned systems (e.g., drones and robots). It specifies a comprehensive set of messages exchanged between unmanned systems and ground stations. This protocol is used in major autopilot systems, mainly ArduPilot and PX4, and provides powerful features not only for monitoring and controlling unmanned systems missions but also for their integration into the Internet. However, there is no technical survey and/ or tutorial in the literature that presents these features or explains how to make use of them. Most of the references are online tutorials and basic technical reports, and none of them presents comprehensive and systematic coverage of the protocol. In this paper, we address this gap, and we propose an overview of the MAVLink protocol, the difference between its versions, and it is potential in enabling Internet connectivity to unmanned systems. We also discuss the security aspects of the MAVLink. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical survey and tutorial on the MAVLink protocol, which represents an important reference for unmanned systems users and developers.",Drone,2019
Proactive Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Surveilling via Jamming in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks,"Legitimately surveilling suspicious wireless communications is important for public security. In this paper, we propose a proactive legitimate unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitor surveilling via a jamming scheme in suspicious decode-and-forward relay networks. To maximize average surveilling rate, we derive a closed-form optimal solution of jamming power given the position of the legitimate UAV monitor. With the derived optimal jamming power, we show that optimal position and jamming power are related to the height of the UAV monitor. Given the height of the UAV monitor, we theoretically prove that the optimal position of the monitor can be found by bisection search. From the numerical results, we show that the optimal position of the monitor found by bisection search achieves exactly the same average surveilling rate as that found by the 1-D search. It is also found that our proposed surveilling scheme with optimal position and jamming is superior to the surveilling scheme with a fixed position and the passive surveilling scheme.",Drone,2019
An improved aerial target detection algorithm,"This paper considers aerial target detection using an improved remote sensing method. The background is removed which can cause a lower signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the radio frequency (RF) signal. The singular value decomposition technique is used to extract the major components of RF signal. To enhance RF signal, the automatic gain control method is employed. The maximum slope and standard deviation are used to analyze the characteristic to provide two results for aerial target detection including the azimuth information and bandwidth. These estimates are used to determine if a target is present in the detection environment. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and better capability of the proposed detection method.",Drone,2019
Designated Verifier Proxy Blind Signature Scheme for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Network Based on Mobile Edge Computing,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has enormous potential in many domains. According to the characteristics of UAV, it is important for UAV network to assure low latency and integrity and authentication of commands sent by command center or command stations to UAV. In this paper, we proposed a UAV network architecture based on mobile edge computing (MEC) which helps guarantee low latency in the UAV network. Afterwards, we proposed a designated verifier proxy blind signature (DVPBS) scheme for UAV network and proved that it is existentially unforgeable under an adaptive chosen message attack in the random oracle model. We compared the efficiency of our DVPBS scheme with other signature schemes by implementing them in jPBC and theoretically analyzing their signature length. The experiment results indicate that our DVPBS scheme is efficient. The signature length of our DVPBS is longer, but it is still short enough compared with the transmission capacity of UAV.",Drone,2019
Low Cost Antenna Array Based Drone Tracking Device for Outdoor Environments,"Applications of direction of arrival (DoA) techniques have dramatically increased in various areas ranging from the traditional wireless communication systems and rescue operations to GNSS systems and drone tracking. Particularly, police forces and security companies have drawn their attention to drone tracking devices, in order to provide the safeness of citizens and of clients, respectively. In this paper, we propose a low cost antenna array based drone tracking device for outdoor environments. The proposed solution is divided into hardware and software parts. The hardware part of the proposed device is based on off-the-shelf components such as an omnidirectional antenna array, a 4-channel software defined radio (SDR) platform with carrier frequency ranging from 70 MHz to 6 GHz, a FPGA motherboard, and a laptop. The software part includes algorithms for calibration, model order selection (MOS), and DoA estimation, including specific preprocessing steps and a tensor-based estimator to increase the DoA accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our proposed low cost solution in outdoor scenarios. According to our measurement campaigns, we show that when the array is in the front fire position, i.e., with a DoA ranging from -60 degrees to 60 degrees, the maximum and the average DoA errors are 6 degrees and 1,9 degrees, respectively.",Drone,2019
Quadrotor UAV flight control via a novel saturation integral backstepping controller,"In this paper, in order to reduce the influence on quadrotor flight from different external disturbances, a novel nonlinear robust controller is designed and used in the quadrotor system. At first, a nonlinear dynamic model of the quadrotor is formulated mathematically. Then, a quadrotor flight controller is designed with the method of classical backstepping control (CBC) and the nonlinear system using this controller is proved to be asymptotically stabilized by the Lyapunov stability theory when there is no external disturbance. At last, a new nonlinear robust controller established by the introduction of both the saturation function and the integral of error into CBC is designed and named as saturation integral backstepping control (SIBC). The boundedness of the nonlinear system under external disturbances is verified by the uniformly ultimately bounded theorem of the nonvanishing perturbation. The numerical simulations of hovering and trajectory tracking are carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK taking the external disturbances into consideration. In addition, a series of outdoor flight experiments were completed on the actual experimental equipments of quadrotor UAV under the time-varying disturbance from wind. According to the simulation and flight experiment results, the proposed SIBC strategy shows a superior robustness than CBC and integral backstepping control (IBC) strategy.",Drone,2019
PHOTOGRAMMETRIC POINT CLOUD CLASSIFICATION BASED ON GEOMETRIC AND RADIOMETRIC DATA INTEGRATION,"Abstract The extraction of information from point cloud is usually done after the application of classification methods based on the geometric characteristics of the objects. However, the classification of photogrammetric point clouds can be carried out using radiometric information combined with geometric information to minimize possible classification issues. With this in mind, this work proposes an approach to the classification of photogrammetric point cloud, generated by correspondence of aerial images acquired by Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS). The proposed approach for classifying photogrammetric point clouds consists of a pixel-supervised classification method, based on a decision tree. To achieve this, three data sets were used, one to define which attributes allow discrimination between the classes and the definition of the thresholds. Initially, several attributes were extracted based on a training sample. The average and standard deviation values for the attributes of each class extracted were used to guide the decision tree definition. The defined decision tree was applied to the other two point clouds to validate the approach and for thematic accuracy assessment. The quantitative analyses of the classifications based on kappa coefficient of agreement, applied to both validation areas, reached values higher than 0.938.",Drone,2019

The proposed principle allows simplifying radio range sensor¡¯s structure maintaining its basic technical characteristics at the level of modern production samples. The device, made according this principle, can be applied to light aircrafts or unmanned aerial vehicles.",Drone,2019
Designing deep CNN models based on sparse coding for aerial imagery: a deep-features reduction approach,"Traditional methods focus on low-levelhandcrafted features representations and it is difficult to design acomprehensive classification algorithm for remote sensing scene classification problems. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have obtained remarkable performance outcomes, setting several remote sensing benchmarks. Furthermore, direct applications of UAV remote sensing images that use deep convolutional networks are extremely challenging given high input data dimensionality with relatively small amounts of available labelled data. We, therefore, propose aCNN approach to scene classification that architecturally incorporates sparse coding (SC) technique for dimension reduction to minimize overfitting. Outcomes were compared with principal component analysis (PCA) and global average pooling (GAP) alternatives that use fully connected layer(s) in pre-trainedCNN architecture(s) to minimize overfitting. SC was used to encode deep features extracted from the last convolutional layer of pre-trainedCNN models by using different features maps in which deep features had been converted into low-dimensionalSC features. These same sparse-codedfeatures were concatenated by means of different pooling techniques to obtain global image features for scene classification. The proposed algorithm outperformed current state-of-the-artalgorithms based on handcrafted features. When using our own UAV-baseddataset and existing datasets, it was also exceptionally efficient computationally when learning data representations, producinga93.64% accuracy rate..",Drone,2019
A-STC: auction-based spanning tree coverage algorithm formotion planning of cooperative robots,"The multi-robot coverage motion planning (MCMP) problem in which every reachable area must be covered is common in multi-robot systems. To deal with the MCMP problem, we propose an efficient, complete, and off-line algorithm, named the auction-based spanning tree coverage (A-STC) algorithm. First, the configuration space is divided into mega cells whose size is twice the minimum coverage range of a robot. Based on connection relationships among mega cells, a graph structure can be obtained. A robot that circumnavigates a spanning tree of the graph can generate a coverage trajectory. Then, the proposed algorithm adopts an auction mechanism to construct one spanning tree for each robot. In this mechanism, an auctioneer robot chooses a suitable vertex of the graph as an auction item from neighboring vertexes of its spanning tree by heuristic rules. A bidder robot submits a proper bid to the auctioneer according to the auction vertexes' relationships with the spanning tree of the robot and the estimated length of its trajectory. The estimated length is calculated based on vertexes and edges in the spanning tree. The bidder with the highest bid is selected as a winner to reduce the makespan of the coverage task. After auction processes, acceptable coverage trajectories can be planned rapidly. Computational experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed MCMP algorithm and the method for estimating trajectory lengths. The proposed algorithm is also compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparative results show that the A-STC algorithm has apparent advantages in terms of the running time and the makespan for large crowded configuration spaces.",Drone,2019
Safe navigation of quadrotors with jerk limited trajectory,"Many aerial applications require unmanned aerial systems operate in safe zones because of the presence of obstacles or security regulations. It is a non-trivial task to generate a smooth trajectory satisfying both dynamic constraints and motion limits of the unmanned vehicles while being inside the safe zones. Then the task becomes even more challenging for real-time applications, for which computational efficiency is crucial. In this study, we present a safe flying corridor navigation method, which combines jerk limited trajectories with an efficient testing method to update the position setpoints in real time. Trajectories are generated online and incrementally with a cycle time smaller than 10 s, which is exceptionally suitable for vehicles with limited onboard computational capability. Safe zones are represented with multiple interconnected bounding boxes which can be arbitrarily oriented. The jerk limited trajectory generation algorithm has been extended to cover the cases with asymmetrical motion limits. The proposed method has been successfully tested and verified in flight simulations and actual experiments.",Drone,2019
Analytical Algorithm for Attitude and Heading Estimation Aided by Maneuver Classification,"This paper presents a modified adaptive analytical algorithm for attitude and heading estimation. The analytical algorithm is based on the fusion of IMU, magnetometers and the velocity from GPS. The kinematic Euler angles are first calculated based on the output of the rate gyros, then the calculated angle errors are compensated using the output of each of the accelerometers, magnetometers, and the velocity taken from a GPS receiver, without the need to model the systematic and random errors of the used sensors; Kalman filter is not used. The algorithm will be adaptive based on the maneuver classification, the filters' parameters will be tuned depending on the maneuver intensity: No, Low, or High maneuver. The main contribution of this paper is to build an attitude and heading estimation algorithm (analytical algorithm) without using Kalman filter; this algorithm will be made adaptive based on the maneuver classification algorithm which was developed using logistic regression technique based on IMU output. Computer simulation with simulated and real flight data showed that the adaptive analytical algorithm has acceptable results compared to EKF.",Drone,2019
Computer Vision System for Automatic Counting of Planting Microsites Using UAV Imagery,"Mechanical site preparation by mounding is often used by the forest industry to provide optimal growth conditions for tree seedlings. Prior to planting, an essential step consists in estimating the number of mounds at each planting block, which serves as planting microsites. This task often requires long and costly field surveys, implying several forestry workers to perform manual counting procedure. This paper addresses the problem of automating the counting process using computer vision and UAV imagery. We present a supervised detection-based counting framework for estimating the number of planting microsites on a mechanically prepared block. The system is trained of fiine to learn feature representations from semi-automatically annotated images. Mound detection and counting are then performed on multispectral UAV images captured at an altitude of 100 m. Our detection framework proceeds by generating region proposals based on local binary patterns (LBP) features extracted from near-infrared (NIR) patches. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then used for classifying candidate regions by considering multispectral image data. To train and evaluate the proposed method, we constructed a new dataset by capturing aerial images from different planting blocks. The results demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed method under challenging experimental conditions. The methods and results presented in this paper form a promising cornerstone to develop advanced decision support systems for planning planting operations.",Drone,2019
Effective Contexts for UAV Vehicle Detection,"Vehicle detection based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images is a challenging task for the small size of objects, complex background, and the imbalance of various vehicle samples. This paper proposes a high-performance UAV vehicle detector. We use the single-shot refinement neural network (RefineDet) as a base network, which employs the top-down architecture to offer contextual information, achieving accurate detection. However, for the small size of vehicles, the top-down architecture introduces too much context, which brings surrounding interference. We present a multi-scale adjacent connection module (ACM) to provide effective contextual information and reduce interference for vehicle detection. In addition, we adopt an alternate double loss training strategy (ADT) to solve the problem of imbalance between hard and easy examples during training, and we design suitable default boxes according to the distribution of the UAV dataset to improve the recall rate. Our method achieves 92.0% and 90.4% accuracy on the collected UAV dataset and the publicly available Stanford drone dataset, respectively. And, the proposed detector can run at 58 FPS on a single GPU.",Drone,2019
Optimum Deployment of Multiple UAVs for Coverage Area Maximization in the Presence of Co-Channel Interference,"The use of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as the aerial base stations can provide wireless communication services in the form of UAV-based small cells (USCs). Thus, the major design challenge that needs to be addressed is the coverage maximization of such USCs in the presence of co-channel interference generated by multiple UAVs operating within a specific target area. Consequently, the efficient deployment strategy is imperative for USCs while optimizing the coverage area performance to compensate for the impact of interference. To this end, this paper presents a coordinated multi-UAV strategy in two scenarios. In the first scenario, symmetric placement of UAVs is assumed at a common optimal altitude and transmit power. In the second scenario, asymmetric deployment of UAVs with different altitudes and transmit powers is assumed. Then, the coverage area performance is investigated as a function of the separation distance between UAVs that are deployed in a certain geographical area to satisfy a target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the cell boundary. Finally, the system-level performance of a boundary user is studied in terms of the coverage probability. The numerical results unveil that the SINR threshold, the separation distance, and the number of UAVs and their formations should be carefully selected to achieve the maximum coverage area inside and to reduce the unnecessary expansion outside the target area. Thus, this paper provides important design guidelines for the deployment of multiple UAVs in the presence of co-channel interference.",Drone,2019
Collision Avoidance Method for Self-Organizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flights,"Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm flights have been investigated widely. In the presence of a high airspace density and increasingly complex flight conditions, collision avoidance between UAV swarms is very important; however, this problem has not been fully addressed, particularly among self-organizing flight clusters. In this paper, we developed a method for avoiding collisions between different types of self-organized UAV clusters in various flight situations. The Reynolds rules were applied to self-organized flights of UAVs and a parameter optimization framework was used to optimize their organization, before developing a collision avoidance solution for UAV swarms. The proposed method can self-organize the flight of each UAV swarm during the overall process and the UAV swarm can continue to fly according to the self-organizing rules in the collision avoidance process. The UAVs in the airspace all make decisions according to their individual type. The UAVs in different UAV swarms can merge in the same space while avoiding collisions, where the UAV's self-organized flight process and collision avoidance process are very closely linked, and the trajectory is smooth to satisfy the actual operational needs. The numerical and experimental tests were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results confirmed the effectiveness of this approach where self-organized flight cluster collision avoidance was successfully achieved by the UAV swarms.",Drone,2019
Development of a Pixel-based Area Measurement Program Using Drone and Camera Module,"As the drone industry has grown greatly in recent years, drones are being used or developed in many industrial fields such as image shooting, pesticide application, delivery service, food delivery etc. In this paper, therefore, we developed a program that takes a user's desired area at a certain height using a camera-equipped drone and obtains the area of the zone the user wants through image processing. The first user selects an area or a path. Afterwards, the drone flies and takes pictures, and then measures the user's needs. A digital image taken at a constant height and with the same resolution is composed of pixels, the area can be calculated easily if we know the number of pixels in the zone the user wants. Particularly, it is easy to calculate the area of various shaped zones, not terrain shapes such as triangles and squares. In addition, the total area of specific places of the entire zone can be calculated. With the program of this paper, anyone can easily calculate the area of the place the user wants using a drone rather than calculating the area through difficult formulas or specialized equipment.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Track and Follow UAV for Aerodynamic Analysis of Vehicles,"This work addresses the issue of finding an optimal flight zone for a side-by-side tracking and following Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) adhering to space-restricting factors brought upon by a dynamic Vector Field Extraction (VFE) algorithm. The VFE algorithm demands a relatively perpendicular field of view of the UAV to the tracked vehicle, thereby enforcing the space-restricting factors which are distance, angle and altitude. The objective of the UAV is to perform side-byside tracking and following of a lightweight ground vehicle while acquiring high quality video of tufts attached to the side of the tracked vehicle. The recorded video is supplied to the VFE algorithm that produces the positions and deformations of the tufts over time as they interact with the surrounding air, resulting in an airflow model of the tracked vehicle. The present limitations of wind tunnel tests and computational fluid dynamics simulation suggest the use of a UAV for real world evaluation of the aerodynamic properties of the vehicle's exterior. The novelty of the proposed approach is alluded to defining the specific flight zone restricting factors while adhering to the VFE algorithm, where as a result we were capable of formalizing a locally-static and a globally-dynamic geofence attached to the tracked vehicle and enclosing the UAV.",Drone,2019
Design of Water Surface Hovering Drone for Underwater Stereo Photography,"In order to shoot underwater, the photographer must be equipped with shooting equipment and enter into the water. Since the photographer directly enters the water, safety accidents occur frequently due to various obstacles or deep water in the water. The proposed underwater stereo photography technique can solve the safety accident problem caused by the entry of the photographer into the water by using the drone for underwater photographing. In addition, this technique has the advantage of obtaining underwater images at low cost. In this study, the angle of the proposed cam for stereoscopic photography was analyzed and the condition that the proper stereoscopic image can be viewed was defined as the distance from the floor of 18cm to the floor distance of 41.4cm. This provision is proposed to be used to adjust the height of the shooting area descended by the elevation chain of the water surface hovering drones.",Drone,2019
Research on Improvements of Ground Forces in Accordance with Ground Operations Command Activation,"Ground Operations Command(GOC) was activated on January 1st, 2019, in order to respond to variable defense environments and strategic situations and accomplish national defense missions more effectively and strongly. GOC, created after deactivation of FROKA and TROKA, is an operational command integrating ground operations in forward area and also a Ground Component Command of controlling ROK-US combined assets led by ROK forces in order for early OPCON transition.The roles and functions of GOC have changed a lot in the process of activation. The roles of supporting Corps with deep area operations in forward area, operations support, and sustainment were added, while in the early stages, they were limited to operational command for Corps. This change has been made in the process of reestablishing the GOC roles of ensuring practical operational condition of Corps, contributing to accomplishment of military strategic goals at operational level.Provisional GOC, tasked2 with GOC activation mission since 2017, established operational execution concepts in accordance with new operational execution concept of JCS, which based the Military Reform 2.0, and pushed ahead with organizing and fielding of weapons systems. Especially, they activated the GOC as it is now by newly organizing fires brigade including missile force, augmenting ground intelligence brigade with addition of drone-bot combat team, completing maneuver Corps which embodies multi-dimensional maneuver operations, and reflecting the concept of warrior platform by which each combatant can exert their best. All these new changes were based on the five game changers that the Army was promoting at that time.In the process, however, there were controversies over the expansion of Forward Boundary(FB) and airspace control. This reflects the necessity of newly formed battlefield organization and deliberate space control to achieve multiplier effects at crossed domains of Army?¡¤Navy?¡¤Air Force, through discarding the traditional three-way concept of being solely responsible for respective ground?¡¤naval?¡¤aerial domains as technological advancement is made. Each force ought to stray out of their collectivistic self-interest and set directions to strengthen their joint capabilities.",Drone,2019
Switching topology approach for UAV formation based on binary-tree network,"Formation control is one of the most active topics within the realm of coordination fields for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The formation pattern is an essential aspect which mainly influences the status of formation flight. This paper focuses on the switching topology approach for a few specific quadrotor UAV formations. A novel switching method based on the binary-tree network (BTN) is developed to realize the transformations between the V-shape and the complete binary tree shape (CBT-shape) topologies. The typical feature of the BTN is the chain structure. Based on the cascaded form of the BTN, a low level feedback controller is designed for the guidance and coordination of UAV swarms. Simulation results demonstrate that the BTN based approach is more superior in the computational cost and real-time performances than several traditional methods. (C) 2017 The Franklin Institute.

Evaluation of Rededge-M Camera for Water Color Observation after Image Preprocessing,"Water color analysis allows non-destructive estimation of abundance of optically active water constituents in the water body. Recently, there have been increasing needs for light-weighted multispectral cameras that can be integrated with low altitude unmanned platforms such as drones, autonomous vehicles, and heli-kites, for the water color analysis by spectroradiometers. This study performs the preprocessing of the Micasense Rededge-M camera which recently receives a growing attention from the earth observation community for its handiness and applicability for local environment monitoring, and investigates the applicability of Rededge-M data for water color analysis. The Vignette correction and the band alignment were conducted for the radiometric image data from Rededge-M, and the sky, water, and solar radiation essential for the water color analysis, and the resultant remote sensing reflectance were validated with an independent hyperspectral instrument, TriOS RAMSES. The experiment shows that Rededge-M generally satisfies the basic performance criteria for water color analysis, although noticeable differences are observed in the blue (475 nm) and the near-infrared (840 nm) band compared with RAMSES.",Drone,2019

Strategic Availability and Cost-Effective UAV-Based Flying Access Networks: S-Modular Game Analysis,"Nowadays, ubiquitous network access has become a reality, thanks to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that have gained extreme popularity due to their flexible deployment and higher chance of line-of-sight links to ground users. Telecommunication service providers deploy UAVs to provide areal network access in remote rural areas, disaster-affected areas, or massive-attended events (sport venues, festivals, etc.), where full setup to provide temporary wireless coverage would be very expensive. Of course, a UAV is battery-powered with a limited energy budget for both mobility aspect and communication aspect. An efficient solution is to allow UAVs switching their radio modules to the sleep mode in order to extend the battery lifetime. This results in temporary unavailability of communication feature. Within such a situation, the ultimate deal for a UAV operator is to provide a cost-effective service with acceptable availability. This would allow meeting some target quality of service while having a good market share granting satisfactory benefits. In this article, we exhibit a new framework with many interesting insights into how to jointly define the availability and the access cost in UAV-empowered flying access networks to opportunistically cover a target geographical area. Yet, we construct a duopoly model to capture the adversarial behavior of service providers in terms of their pricing policies and their respective availability probabilities. Optimal periodic beaconing (advertising the presence of the UAV) is to be addressed, given the UAVs with limited battery capacity and their recharging constraints. A full analysis of the game, both in terms of equilibrium pricing and equilibrium availability, is derived. We show that the availability-pricing game exhibits some nice features as it is submodular with respect to the availability policy; whereas, it is supermodular with respect to the service fee. Furthermore, we implement a learning scheme using best response dynamics that allows operators to learn their joint pricing-availability strategies in a fast, accurate, and distributed fashion. Extensive simulations show convergence of the proposed scheme to the joint pricing-availability equilibrium and offer promising insights into how the game parameters should be chosen to efficiently control the duopoly game.",Drone,2019
Developing a radar receiver with a large dynamic range for UAV detection,"The requirements for a multi-beam radar receiver used for detecting small-scale low-visible low-speed targets at short range against the background of reflections from the earth¡¯s surface and local objects, are extremely high in terms of providing a large dynamic range for 1 dB of compression, low noise and low power consumption.

Multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle control system based on hybrid neuroregulator,"Compact multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles are used to solve a variety of problems, from aerial photography to reconnaissance and goods delivery, but at present, their widespread use is constrained by the imperfection of stabilization and navigation systems. The problem can be solved by methods of neurocontrol, which are known to be an essential tool when nonlinear behavior of the craft should be taken into account. A new approach for creation of a multirotor aircraft control system is considered based on a hybrid parallel neurocontroller that uses an artificial neural network of radial basis functions. Parallel neurocontrol provides for the simultaneous use of both the conventional proportional-integral-derivative controller and the neurocontroller in the control loop, their outputs being combined. In order to optimize the calculations performed during the second layer of the neurocontroller network training, a piecewise linear function of N segments, symmetric about zero, was chosen as the function for activating the neurons of the second layer. A low-cost method is proposed for parameter optimization of the activation functions of the hidden layer neurons. It allows for network training in real time. The proposed hybrid parallel neurocontroller is implemented and studied on the basis of an artificial neural network of radial basis functions. Bench tests have shown that the stabilization of the three axes of the hybrid neurocontroller provides quality control better than a conventional manually tuned proportional-integral-derivative controller, namely, reducing the transition time, lower amplitude oscillations in the stabilization of the unmanned aerial vehicle and increase the stability of the craft to external influences. The use of hybrid parallel neurocontroller will help to solve the problems of maneuvering and stabilization of the craft for the transition to the local navigation problem solution.",Drone,2019

Facility Location Problem Approach for Distributed Drones,"Currently, industry and academia are undergoing an evolution in developing the next generation of drone applications. Including the development of autonomous drones that can carry out tasks without the assistance of a human operator. In spite of this, there are still problems left unanswered related to the placement of drone take-off, landing and charging areas. Future policies by governments and aviation agencies are inevitably going to restrict the operational area where drones can take-off and land. Hence, there is a need to develop a system to manage landing and take-off areas for drones. Additionally, we proposed this approach due to the lack of justification for the initial location of drones in current research. Therefore, to provide a foundation for future research, we give a justified reason that allows predetermined location of drones with the use of drone ports. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to optimally place these drone ports to minimize the average distance drones must travel based on a set of potential drone port locations and tasks generated in a given area. Our approach is derived from the Facility Location problem which produces an efficient near optimal solution to place drone ports that reduces the overall drone energy consumption. Secondly, we apply various traveling salesman algorithms to determine the shortest route the drone must travel to visit all the tasks.",Drone,2019
A Study on Ultra Wide-Angle Lens Distortion Correction Technique for Object Situation Recognition in Drone Flight,"This paper is for omni-directional image monitoring using drones equipped with GPS and super wide angle image lens. It proposes an algorithm that corrects and separates distorted images of super-wide-angle lens and accurately detects the surrounding information and proximity information of the object, and implements it through conversion test and empirical test. In this case, the distortion correction coefficient of the ultra-wide-angle lens was extracted by the pre-patterning operation and the 360???¡ã omni-directional image was transformed into the orthogonal coordinate system through the coordinate system transformation.Finally, the location information of the object is provided based on the target GPS coordinates and the state information of the object is imaged via the zoom camera.

In the future, it is necessary to provide detailed image information such as reference point patch and correction point matching technique through location based search technology and fusion research.",Drone,2019
Least square estimation-based adaptive complimentary filter for attitude estimation,"Attitude estimation is one of the core fundamentals for navigation of unmanned vehicles and other robotic systems. With the advent of low cost and low accuracy micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based inertial sensors, these devices are used ubiquitously for all such commercial grade systems that need motion information. However, these sensors suffer from time-varying bias and noise parameters, which need to be compensated during system state estimation. Complementary filtering is one of such techniques that is used here for estimating attitude of a moving vehicle. However, the complementary filter structure is dependent on user fed gain parameters, K-P and K-I and needs a mechanism by which they can be obtained automatically. In this paper, an attempt has been made towards addressing this issue by applying least square estimation technique on the error obtained between estimated and measured attitude angles. The proposed algorithm simplifies the design of nonlinear complementary filter by computing the filter gains automatically. The experimental investigation has been carried out over several datasets, confirming the advantage of obtaining gain parameters automatically for the complementary filtering structure.",Drone,2019
Differential Ranging Method of Locating Satellite Communication System Earth Stations using Repeater on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"The article presents the differential ranging method of locating modern earth stations with narrow radiation patterns. Earth station position data is proposed to be calculated using maximum-likelihood procedure system solution from three differential equations using one of numerical methods. In this case supplementary assessment parameter of location, calculated by measuring a mutual signal delay of an earth station, relayed through a spacecraft on geostationary orbit and a mobile repeater on the unmanned aerial vehicle, can improve the accuracy of coordinate estimation earth station. For the developed method the analytical expressions of potential accuracy of calculation of coordinates of the earth station on the basis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound are developed. To measure the positioning accuracy of located emitters it is suggested to use the errors ellipsoid corresponding to the provision of a source of a radio emission in space. The analysis of standard routes of the movement of a repeater on the unmanned aerial vehicle is carried out and the conclusion is drawn that the best accuracy and the shortest route simultaneously are achieved, if the unmanned aerial vehicle follows a circular trajectory along the control area. Calculation of potential accuracy of positioning of the terrestrial station for the area of 50 by 50 km is executed.It is shown that the error of the estimates, received as a result of statistical tests, doesn¡¯t surpass the size of a big half shaft of the error ellipsoid calculated with application of analytical expressions. The application of the developed method is possible in the implementation of the software of electronic control systems to counteract illegitimate use of frequency resource of space vehicles-satellite repeaters communication system.",Drone,2019
INVESTIGATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY OF MUTUAL NAVIGATION AND ORIENTATION OF SMALL SPACE VEHICLES FLYING IN FORMATION,"The paper presents the problem of ensuring support of the flight of a group of small spacecraft (microsatellites) taking into account the small mutual distances between them. The purpose of using the orbital constellation specified is to create a radio communication system to control remote objects like unmanned aerial vehicles and ground robots located in hard-to-reach areas of the Earth from the Central ground station. To reduce the cost of microsatellite design, it was decided to rigidly fix the receiving and transmitting antennas on their housings and use the spatial orientation of the entire apparatus for antenna guidance. This seriously complicated the tasks of navigation and orientation of microsatellites in a formation and required the development of a new method for determining the orientation of a single microsatellite. The essence of the method is to process the image obtained by means of a video camera mounted on a nearby microsatellite. We used methods of computer vision. The results of mathematical modeling simulation, as well as the results of full-scale bench experiment confirming the efficiency of the proposed method are presented.",Drone,2019
Energy Consumption and Completion Time Tradeoff in Rotary-Wing UAV Enabled WPCN,"In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless-powered communication network (WPCN), where a rotary-wing UAV is employed as a hybrid access point (AP) to serve multiple ground users (GUs). Specifically, the GUs harvest radio frequency (RF) energy from the signal sent by the UAV, which is then used by the GUs to power their uplink information transmission to the UAV. In practice, the mission completion time and energy consumption are two important indexes to evaluate the performance of UAV-enabled communication. To complete the mission as soon as possible, the UAV should fly above the ground users it serves at maximum speed, but this leads to more propulsion energy being consumed. Our objective is to reveal the energy-time tradeoff, characterized by the boundary of the so-called ""Energy-Time'' region. Wefirst derive the mathematical form of the tradeoff, the UAV trajectory, user scheduling and mission completion time, as well as the time allocation, all of which need to be jointly optimized. To this end, we propose two communication protocols: (i)fly-hover-communicate and (ii) path discretization. For each protocol, we first find the two extremes, where minimum energy consumption and minimum mission completion time are achieved. We then complete the boundary for minimizing the energy consumption for given mission completion time. Moreover, because of the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique for both designs. Finally, the simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our study.",Drone,2019
FS-MAC: An Adaptive MAC Protocol With Fault-Tolerant Synchronous Switching for FANETs,"Medium access control (MAC) is significant for guaranteeing the quality of service of Flying Ad-hoc NETworks (FANETs). The adaptive MAC protocol is recognized as a promising solution, which is able to improve the flexibility and robustness of FANETs. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant synchronous-MAC (FS-MAC) protocol that can switch between CSMA/CA and TDMA protocols for the FANETs. In FS-MAC, we propose a distributed Q-learning-based MAC switching scheme which contains a MAC pre-selection operation and a practical byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT)-based consensus decision procedure to produce a MAC switching decision. By the MAC pre-selection operation, each UAV can evaluate its own performance accurately and determine which MAC protocol is more appropriate. Then, all UAVs in FANETs can implement fault-tolerant synchronous switching with the help of the PBFT-based consensus decision procedure. The simulations are conducted to evaluate the various performance of the FS-MAC. It is shown that FS-MAC can significantly outperform the baseline protocols in terms of the average throughput, delay, and packet retransmission ratio performance.",Drone,2019
Semantic Segmentation of Transmission Lines and Their Accessories Based on UAV-Taken Images,"While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) facilitate transmission line inspection to some extent, they also generate numerous raw images rather than defect analysis results. Because analyzing the UAV-taken images by a human approach is an arduous work, an automatic method is needed to improve the analysis efficiency. In this paper, a framework is proposed to perform the image semantic segmentation of transmission lines and their accessories to generate the final defect detection results. A segment connection algorithm based on matrix operations is proposed to rapidly connect the segment features of objects. In line accessory detection, a background filter and an artificial contour segment feature generator are constructed to improve the detection performance. In addition, a distance threshold parameter automatic tuning mechanism is presented. Images provided by China Southern Power Grid Company taken by the UAVs are employed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed image semantic segmentation framework.",Drone,2019
Preamble Design for UAV Communications Over Cellular Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications over cellular networks are currently gaining increased interest because it can enable real-time control of UAVs and wide-area coverage. We discuss various challenges for future UAV cellular networks, where cellular networks with down-tilted antennas optimized for terrestrial users can extend terrestrial cellular services to aerial users. To overcome challenges such as large channel variation and UAV power consumption in UAV cellular networks, we propose a technique of preamble design for these networks using scalable sequences. Specifically, three types of scalable sequences are proposed for efficient use of battery power in UAVs, namely, maximum-length scalable sequence, Zadoff-Chu scalable sequence, and linear frequency modulated (LFM) scalable sequence. The properties of these scalable sequences are analyzed and compared through simulations in different channel environments.",Drone,2019
Workspace Modeling and Path Planning for Truss Structure Inspection by Unmanned Aircraft,"Small unmanned aircraft systems can increase efficiency and reduce risk to humans during the inspection of truss-supported structures such as steel bridges. This paper describes a method to mathematically represent a truss and subsequently to plan an efficient collision-free inspection path. The algorithm checks user-defined perspectives for feasibility and redefines any infeasible perspectives. A deterministic roadmap is then generated as the complete graph over these perspectives, and some additional nodes are generated near the joints of the structure. A traveling salesman problem (TSP) is solved to find an efficient inspection path that tours all perspective points, and a local A* path planner then refines the inspection path to circumvent obstructions. The TSP is re-solved, with an updated cost based on local detours; and the process iterates until a feasible TSP solution is found. The ""lazy"" approach to global and local planning, for which paths are checked for feasibility after the fact and amended if necessary, ensures quick convergence to an efficient inspection path. Simulation results show the functionality of the algorithm. Comparison with a probabilistic roadmap method indicates the proposed algorithm's efficiency.",Drone,2019
Part-Based Background-Aware Tracking for UAV With Convolutional Features,"In recent years, visual tracking is a challenging task in UAV applications. The standard correlation filter (CF) has been extensively applied for UAV object tracking. However, the CF-based tracker severely suffers from boundary effects and cannot effectively cope with object occlusion, which results in suboptimal performance. Besides, it is still a tough task to obtain an appearance model precisely with hand-crafted features. In this paper, a novel part-based tracker is proposed for the UAV. With successive cropping operations, the tracking object is separated into several parts. More specially, the background-aware correlation filters with different cropping matrices are applied. To estimate the translation and scale variation of the tracking object, a structured comparison, and a Bayesian inference approach are proposed, which jointly achieve a coarse-to-fine strategy. Moreover, an adaptive mechanism is used to update the local appearance model of each part with a Gaussian process regression method. To construct a better appearance model, features extracted from the convolutional neural network are utilized instead of hand-crafted features. Through extensive experiments, the proposed tracker reaches competitive performance on 123 challenging UAV image sequences and outperforms other 20 popular state-of-the-art visual trackers in terms of overall performance and different challenging attributes.",Drone,2019
UNCERTAINTY IN DETERMINING THE PARAMETERS OF THE SURFACE DEFORMATION MODEL,"Predicting surface deformations caused by underground mining is an issue of significance both for the safety of overlaying facilities and for economic purposes. There are many different models for predicting the impact of underground mining on the land surface. One of them is the Knothe model commonly used in Poland and in the world. The paper presents two methods of estimating Knothe model parameters uncertainty. The parallel application of two methods enables the mutual verification of the results obtained and the identification of the potential errors and their sources in the case of any discrepancies. The first method is based on the socalled law of propagation of uncertainty, which in essence is the approximation based on the first-order Taylor series expansion. The second presented method is based on the Monte Carlo simulation.",Drone,2019
Resource minimization and power reduction of ESPFFIR filter using unified adder/subtractor,"Digital filters are the important processing elements in most of the digital signal processing system designs, ranging from medical signal processing to wireless communication. Low power and area efficient Finite Impulse Response filter is designed with the aid of parallel processing which increases the throughput. Symmetric property reduces the multipliers into half in Even Symmetric Parallel Fast Finite Impulse Response (ESPFFIR) filters. The adder and the subtractor present in the pre/post-processing blocks increase in accordance with the block size L of ESPFFIR filter which in turn increases the numbers of unified operators. The canonical signed digit representation of the coefficient in the design Multiple Constant Multiplications (MCM) based multipliers has the advantages of utilizing unified operators in sub-filter block of ESPFFIR. To reduce the power consumption and resource utilization of the ESPFFIR filter, the unified operator used in the pre/post processing and MCM blocks are replaced by unified adder subtractor (UAS). The UAS utilizes fewer resources for simultaneous calculation of sum and difference of two operands with less area and low power consumption. This paper shows the design of 16-bit Square Root (SQRT) UAS CSLA adder using UAS logical element to reduce the area utilization, power consumption and delay. Then the Heuristic of cumulative benefit (Hcub) based MCM multiplier is designed using UAS. The existing SQRT BEC CSLA adder and subtractor with same input present in the pre/post processing block of the ESPFFIR filters are replaced by a single SQRT UAS CSLA in suitable places. The Hcub MCM used in the sub-filter blocks of the ESPFFIR are replaced using SQRT UAS CSLA based MCM multiplier. The SQRT UAS CSLA consumes 78% less area, 29.51% less power and 24% less delay when compared to the BEC CSLA 2 (one BEC based CSLA Adder plus one BEC based CSLA Subtractor). Finally, the SQRT UAS CSLA adder and Hcub based UAS MCM multipliers are used to design the filter, the overall area and power consumption of UAS based ESPFFIR is reduced compared with the existing BEC based ESPFFIR filter. Cadence RC tool is used for analysis.",Drone,2019
Passive Initialization Method Based on Motion Characteristics for Monocular SLAM,"Visual SLAM techniques have proven to be effective methods for estimating robust position and attitude in the field of robotics. However, current monocular SLAM algorithms cannot guarantee timeliness of system startup due to the problematic initialization time and the low success rates. This paper introduces a rectilinear platform motion hypothesis and thereby converts the estimation problem into a verification problem to achieve fast monocular SLAM initialization. The proposed method is simulation tested on a fixed-wing UAV. Tests show that the proposed method can produce faster initialization of visual SLAM and that the advantages are more profound on systems with sparse image features.",Drone,2019
Disturbance observer-based quadrotor attitude tracking control for aggressive maneuvers,"In this paper, a disturbance observer-based quadrotor attitude controller for aggressive maneuvering is presented. The controller is made up of the cascade connection between two control-loops: an outer quatemion-based attitude control-loop and an inner disturbance observer-based angular velocity tracking control-loop. The disturbance observer is designed to estimate and compensate for the Coriolis term and the external disturbances. It is shown that, for fast maneuvers, the disturbance observer needs to take into account the motor dynamics. This allows to notably increase the observer bandwidth, leading to significant improvements in the disturbance rejection capabilities. The stability of the resulting closed-loop is analyzed. Also, different simulations and flight tests are carried out to validate the main results, showing an outstanding tracking performance when aggressive attitude maneuvers are being executed, even in the presence of strong disturbances such as suspended payloads.",Drone,2019
Future UAV-Based ITS: A Comprehensive Scheduling Framework,"Multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been recently recognized as one of the top emerging technologies to be utilized in various smart city domains such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They represent an innovative mean to complement existing technologies to surveil transportation network, control traffic, and monitor incidents. The UAVs usually operate for time-limited missions due to their limited battery capacity. Hence, they need to frequently return to their docking stations to recharge their batteries, which handicaps their mission coverage and performance. When designing a UAV-based ITS infrastructure, it is crucial to leverage the UAV fleet effectively. In this paper, a generic management framework of UAVs for ITS applications is developed. The problem of docking/charging station placement is first investigated to find optimized locations for a given number of stations to be installed by the ITS operator. To this end, two fundamental criteria are taken into account: i) the flying time required by the UAV to reach the mission/incident location and ii) the risk of battery failure during the UAV operation. The two algorithms, namely a penalized weighted k-means algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, are designed for this purpose. Once the docking stations are placed, a UAV scheduling program is formulated to optimally cover the pre-known missions while minimizing the total energy consumption of the fleet and respecting a coverage efficiency targeted by the ITS operator. The proposed proactive scheduling approach employs multiple UAVs in sequential and parallel ways to cover spatially and temporally distributed events in the geographical area of interest over a long period.",Drone,2019
Enhanced Deployment Strategy for the 5G Drone-BS Using Artificial Intelligence,"The use of drones to perform various task has recently gained a lot of attention. Drones have been used by traders to deliver goods to customers, scientists, and researchers to observe and search for endangered species, and by the military during critical operations. The flexibility of drones in remote controlling makes them ideal candidates to perform critical tasks with minimum time and cost. In this paper, we use drones to setup base stations that provide 5G cellular coverage over a given area in danger. The aim of this paper is to determine the optimum number of drones and their optimum location, such that each point in the selected area is covered with the least cost while considering communication relevant parameters such as data rate, latency, and throughput. The problem is mathematically modeled by forming linear optimization equations. For fast optimized solutions, genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms are provisionally employed to solve the problem, and the results are accordingly compared. Using these two meta-heuristic methods, quick and relatively inexpensive feedback can be provided to designers and service providers in 5G next generation networks.",Drone,2019
Smart Relay Architecture for over-the-Horizon High Quality Communications With Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"This paper presents a system architecture to accomplish over-the-horizon communications with medium-sized unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in order to enhance its autonomy and maximum range. This architecture is based on using a second UAV as a communication relay with a compact active circular array with separated transmitting and receiving elements at C-band. The designed active feeding network provides switching capabilities in order to selectively activate these elements depending on the desired direction of the antenna beam, achieving maximum equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) in transmission and maximum antenna gain in reception. In this way, a bidirectional long-range link for telemetry, telecommand, and high-resolution video can be deployed between UAVs providing high quality of service, reliability, and moderate data throughput at an affordable cost. Based on the measurements of a manufactured prototype, the maximum range of the deployed air-air link using the designed system is estimated in 20 km, considerably increasing the performance of current systems based on the use of omnidirectional antennas onboard UAVs.",Drone,2019
Remote Sensing Target Tracking in UAV Aerial Video Based on Saliency Enhanced MDnet,"Remote sensing target tracking in the aerial video from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) plays a key role in public security. As the UAV aerial video has rapid changes in scale and perspective, few pixels in the target region, and multiple similar disruptors, and the main tracking methods in this research field generally have relatively low tracking performance and timeliness, we propose a remote sensing target tracking method for the UAV aerial video based on a saliency enhanced multi-domain convolutional neural network (SEMD). First, in the pre-training stage, we combine the least squares generative adversarial networks (LSGANs) with a multi-orientation Gaussian Pyramid to augment typical easily confused negative samples for enhancing the capacity to distinguish between targets and the background. Then, a saliency module was integrated into our tracking network architecture to boost the saliency of the feature map, which can improve the representation power of a rapid dynamic change target. Finally, in the stage for generating tracking samples, we implemented a local weight allocation model to screen for hard negative samples. This approach can not only improve the stability in tracking but also boost efficiency.

A Power Series Approach for Hybrid-Duplex UAV Communication Systems Under Rician Shadowed Fading,"A hybrid-duplex (HBD) UAV communication system (UCS), i.e., HBD-UCS, to improve spectrum utilization is investigated in this work. By considering the combined effect of fading and shadowing, a comprehensive outage probability analysis of the HBD-UCS under various inter-UAV interference and shadowing scenarios over Rician shadowed fading channels is conducted. It is demonstrated that the ground station (GS) in full-duplex (ED) mode operates at lower outage probability than in half-duplex (HD) mode. Furthermore, the joint detector is shown to achieve lower outage probability than the interference ignorant (II) detector and HD-UCS, even when severe shadowing is encountered. As such, utilizing joint detectors in an HBD-UCS enables multi-UAV networks to achieve high reliability when operating in urban environments.",Drone,2019
Robust RFID Based 6-DoF Localization for Unmannad Aerial Vehicles,"Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are usually deploy outdoors, there is increasing interest in applying UAVs for indoor applications. It is a highly attractive and challenging task to precisely localize a UAV in an indoor environment where Global Positioning System (GPS) service is absent. In this paper, we present RFUAV, a Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) enhanced UAV system that provides a precise 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF) pose for UAVs. With RFUAV, three or more ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID tags are attached to the UAV and are interrogated by a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID reader with multiple antennas. Based on phase measurements of the RFID tag responses, the RFID tracker of RFUAV, a Bayesian filter-based algorithm, was employed to track the position of the tags in a global coordinate system. The pose estimator of RFUAV computes the 6-DoF pose of the UAV from tag positions. We tested the performance of RFUAV in a representative, structure-rich, indoor environment, where 0.04 m position error and 2.5 degrees orientation error were achieved.",Drone,2019
PSO-Based Dynamic UAV Positioning Algorithm for Sensing Information Acquisition in Wireless Sensor Networks,"In this paper, we propose a dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning method to maximize the value of the sensor data information acquired from multiple UAVs in wireless sensor networks. In operations of UAVs to monitor environmental disasters or perform military missions, the value of the acquired sensing information depends on the sensor types and the elapsed time after the previous sensing time. To support real-time sensor data monitoring, the sensed data should be successfully delivered to the ground base station (or sink node) using a UAV flying ad-hoc network; herein, it is important to maintain the connectivity between the UAVs and to consider the reliability of the communication links. In this paper, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to derive optimum UAV locations. For a specified wireless sensor network, at each time instance, new UAV locations are updated that guarantee complete connectivity of the UAVs and maximize the value of the aggregated sensor data information. In this paper, we have formulated the UAV location search model as a constrained optimization problem with multi-objective utility functions using PSO-based bio-inspired algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that by maximizing the intended multi-objective utility function, the proposed method can dynamically derive the optimal locations of multiple UAVs and achieve better sensing information acquisition compared to other methods.",Drone,2019

Fast vision-based autonomous detection of moving cooperative target for unmanned aerial vehicle landing,"We propose a fast and effective method, fast target detection (FTD), to detect the moving cooperative target for the unmanned aerial vehicle landing, and the target is composed of double circles and a cross. The purpose of our strategy is to land on the target. The FTD method needs to detect the target at the high and low heights. At the high height, the target appears completely and stably in the camera field. The FTD method can detect the circle and cross to rapidly reach the target center, named cross and circle-FTD (C-2 - FTD). To detect the cross, we propose a slope distance equation to obtain the distance between two slopes. The proposed slopes cluster method, based on the distance equation and K-means, is used to determine the cross center. At the low height, the target appears incompletely and unstably. Therefore, FTD methods detect only the cross, named cross-FTD (C-1 - FTD). We extract the cross features (CFs) based on line segments. Then, four CFs are combined based on graph theory. Experiments on our four datasets show that FTD has rapid speed and good performance. (Our method is implemented in C++ and is available at https://github.com/Li-Zhaoxi/UAV-Vision-Servo.) On the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge datasets made we constructed, C-2 - FTD detects the target from a 960 x 540 image approximately 20 ms per pipeline with 82.24% F-measure and tracks target approximately 6.27 ms per pipeline with 94.39% F-measure. C-1 - FTD detects centers from a 480 x 270 image at approximately 4.69 ms per image with 86.05% F-measure.",Drone,2019
Trajectory tracking control of a quadrotor UAV based on sliding mode active disturbance rejection control,"This paper proposes a sliding mode active disturbance rejection control scheme to deal with trajectory tracking control problems for the quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Firstly, the differential signal of the reference trajectory can be obtained directly by using the tracking differentiator (TD), then the design processes of the controller can be simplified. Secondly, the estimated values of the UAV's velocities, angular velocities, total disturbance can be acquired by using extended state observer (ESO), and the total disturbance of the system can be compensated in the controller in real time, then the robustness and anti-interference capability of the system can be improved. Finally, the sliding mode controller based on TD and ESO is designed, the stability of the closed-loop system is proved by Lyapunov method. Simulation results show that the control scheme proposed in this paper can make the quadrotor track the desired trajectory quickly and accurately.",Drone,2019
Wind and Payload Disturbance Rejection Control Based on Adaptive Neural Estimators: Application on Quadrotors,"In this work, a new intelligent control strategy based on neural networks is proposed to cope with some external disturbances that can affect quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) dynamics. Specifically, the variation of the system mass during logistic tasks and the influence of the wind are considered. An adaptive neuromass estimator and an adaptive neural disturbance estimator complement the action of a set of PID controllers, stabilizing the UAV and improving the system performance. The control strategy has been extensively tested with different trajectories: linear, helical, circular, and even a lemniscate one. During the experiments, the mass of the UAV is triplicated and winds of 6 and 9 in Beaufort's scale are introduced. Simulation results show how the online learning of the estimator increases the robustness of the controller, reducing the effects of the changes in the mass and of the wind on the quadrotor.",Drone,2019
Dynamic Control Scheme of Multiswarm Persistent Surveillance in a Changing Environment,"The persistent surveillance problem has been proved to be an NP hard problem for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle systems (UAVs). However, most studies in multiple UAV control focus on control cooperative path planning in a single swarm, while dynamic deployment of a multiswarm system is neglected. This paper proposes a collective control scheme to drive a multiswarm UAVs system to spread out over a time-sensible environment to provide persistent adaptive sensor coverage in event-related surveillance scenarios. We design the digital turf model to approximate the mixture information of mission requirements and surveillance reward. Moreover, we design a data clustering-based algorithm for the dynamic assignment of UAV swarms, which can promote workload balance, while also allowing real-time response to emergencies. Finally, we evaluate the proposed architecture by means of simulation and find that our method is superior to the conventional control strategy in terms of detection efficiency and subswarm equilibrium degree.",Drone,2019
Robust Altitude Stabilization of VTOL-UAV for Payloads Delivery,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of robust altitude stabilization for the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) of an unmanned aerial vehicle in the presence of external disturbances (e.g. wind gusts), payload variations, and noisy measurements. The design of the controller is simple; it is based on the minimization of the one-step-ahead predicted position errors. The stability analysis of the closed loop in the presence of external disturbances is presented. The analysis results prove that the tracking errors of attitude, take-off, hovering, and landing are uniformly bounded. Since the proposed control algorithm will be employed for goods delivery by drones, the robustness of this algorithm against low-frequency disturbances and payload variations is a major objective. To this end, integral action is included in the altitude loop to eliminate the induced steady-state error and to drop off the payload in the desired position successfully. Furthermore, the controller is given in the closed form to facilitate its implementation onboard to increase the autonomy of the flight. The numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",Drone,2019
Integration of sensor vision capabilities on UAV flight route optimization: A linear model and a heuristic algorithm proposal,"Nowadays countries provide great resources for the research and development activities to develop Unmanned Air Vehicle technologies. The most important problem encountered in efficient use of these technologically intensive systems is to determine the minimum cost route plan which can observe the maximum number of targets. Unmanned Air Vehicle Route Optimization Problem is considered as the integration of Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem in the literature. Unmanned Air Vehicle Route Models can be developed by incorporating the vision capabilities of the sensors into the route plan. In this study, taking into account the sensor capabilities an integrated linear model and a two-phased heuristic routing algorithm are proposed for the route planing process of Unmanned Air Vehicle. A generic scenario related to surveillance and reconnaissance activities on southern borderline of Turkey has been developed in order to test the proposed models. The test results show that integrating sensor vision capabilities on Unmanned Air Vehicle flight route model is effective in minimization of total flight distance and the proposed two-phased heuristic routing algorithm can be effectively used in the Unmanned Air Vehicle route planing process.",Drone,2019
Inspired by Human Eye: Vestibular Ocular Reflex Based Gimbal Camera Movement to Minimize Viewpoint Changes,"Human eyeballs move relative to the head, resulting in optimal changes in the viewpoint. We tested similar vestibular ocular reflex (VOR)-based movement on Zenmuse-X3 gimbal camera relative to pre-defined YAW movements of the DJI Matrice-100 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Changes in viewpoint have various consequences for visual and graphical rendering. Therefore, this study investigated how to minimize these changes. OpenGL visualization was performed to simulate and measure viewpoint changes using the proposed VOR-based eyeball movement algorithm and compared with results of VOR based gimbal movement. The gimbal camera was setup to render images (scenes) on flat monitors. Positions of pre-fixed targets in the images were used to measure the viewpoint changes. The proposed approach could successfully control and significantly reduce the viewpoint changes and stabilize the image to improve visual tracking of targets on flat monitors. The proposed method can also be used to render real-time camera feed to a head-mounted display (HMD) in an ergonomically pleasing way.",Drone,2019
A 3D Non-Stationary Wideband GBSM for Low-Altitude UAV-to-Ground V2V MIMO Channels,"Due to the high-mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), actual UAV channel measurements show that low-altitude air-to-ground (A2G) channels in UAV communications illustrate non-stationary properties. This fact motivates us to develop a non-stationary channel model for UAV-to-ground links. In this paper, we propose a three-dimensional (3D) wideband non-stationary A2G vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) geometry-based stochastic channel model (GBSM). In the proposed model, both UAVs and ground terminals can be moving, which makes the model more general. In order to mimic the non-stationary channel characteristics, parameters like the number of clusters, power, time delays, angels of departure (AoDs), and angles of arrival (AoAs) are all time-variant. The proposed model combining a line-of-sight (LoS) component, a ground reflection component, a cylinder model, and multiple confocal truncated ellipsoid models has the ability to investigate the impact of UAV heights and transceivers' movements on channel characteristics in diverse environments. Statistical properties like temporal autocorrelation function (ACF), spatial cross-correlation function (CCF), Doppler power spectral density (PSD), and stationary interval of A2G channels are derived and analyzed in detail. In addition, derived root mean square delay spread (RMS-DS), temporal ACF and spatial CCF are validated against channel measurement results. Furthermore, by adjusting channel parameters, the proposed GBSM is sufficiently generic and adaptable to model various UAV-to-ground communication scenarios.",Drone,2019
Development of Path Planning Approach Using Improved A-star Algorithm in AGV System,"Automated guided vehicles (AGV) has been widely applied in industry, especially in warehousing, logistics and port transportation, etc. The most important issue in the AGV control system is how to determine the shortest path. Although A-star algorithm is usually used to solve this problem due to its fast computational time, it may suffer from some drawbacks, for instance, there are too many unnecessary inflection points and redundant nodes during its moving process. For this reason, the improved A-star algorithm is proposed to optimize the motion path, including the reduction of path length, number of AGV turns and path planning time. In this scheme, a key point selection strategy is used for the secondary planning based on the initial path obtained by the A-Star algorithm. Therefore, redundant inflection points and nodes in the path can be effectively removed. Additionally, the rotation direction and rotation angle of AGV at the inflection point can be thus determined. This improved A-star method can provide a more efficient path planning with shorter routes, less turn times and shorter operation time compared with previous methods, such as the A-star algorithm and the ant colony algorithm.",Drone,2019
Optimal Configuration Analysis of AOA Localization and Optimal Heading Angles Generation Method for UAV Swarms,"In this paper, the angle-of-arrival (AOA) measurements are adapted to locate a target using the UAV swarms equipped with passive receivers. The measurement noise is considered to be target-to-receiver distance dependent. The Cramer-Rao low bound (CRLB) of the AOA localization is calculated, and the optimal deployments are explored through changing angular separations and distances. Then, a distributed collaborative autonomous generation (DCAG) method is proposed based on the deep neural network (NN). The off-line training and on-line application rules are applied to generate the optimal heading angles for the UAV swarms in the AOA localization. The simulation results show that through the DCAG method, the generated heading angles for UAV swarms enhance the localization accuracy and stability.",Drone,2019
Joint Optimization of Area Throughput and Grid-Connected Microgeneration in UAV-Based Mobile Networks,"Small cells (SCs) mounted on top of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are a promising solution to boost the capacity in hotspot areas. However, the adoption of UAV-SCs involves the planning of their missions over time, which includes the scheduling of recharging actions of each UAV-SC at ground sites. Typically, the energy needed to recharge UAV-SCs is derived from the grid, which can be coupled with microgeneration exploiting renewable energy sources (e.g., solar panels). In this architecture, the energy that is locally produced can be either sold to the grid or used to recharge the UAV-SCs. On the other hand, when the energy from microgeneration is insufficient for recharging the UAV-SCs, additional energy can be bought from the grid. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between maximizing the throughput provided by the UAV-SCs over a set of areas, maximizing energy sold to the grid, and maximizing energy bought from the grid. The proposed model, MAXUAVPROFIT, is designed to (i) plan the UAV-SCs missions as a sequence of positions and actions in 3D space vs. time, (ii) manage the grid-connected microgeneration, and (iii) control the amount of throughput received by each hotspot. We then evaluate the MAXUAVPROFIT in a realistic scenario, which is based on the measurement of real cellular metrics and a realistic UAV-SC energy consumption model. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the MAXUAVPROFIT with respect to other competing solutions, which include either optimization of microgeneration or maximization of the area throughput.",Drone,2019

Finally, simulation results are presented to assert the validity of the method.",Drone,2019
A Novel UAV-Aided Network Architecture Using Wi-Fi Direct,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in future wireless networks is gaining attention due to their quick deployment without requiring the existing infrastructure. Earlier studies on UAV-aided communication consider generic scenarios, and very few studies exist on the evaluation of UAV-aided communication in practical networks. The existing studies also have several limitations, and hence, an extensive evaluation of the benefits of UAV communication in practical networks is needed. In this paper, we proposed a UAV-aided Wi-Fi Direct network architecture. In the proposed architecture, a UAV equipped with a Wi-Fi Direct group owner (GO) device, the so-called Soft-AP, is deployed in the network to serve a set of Wi-Fi stations. We propose to use a simpler yet efficient algorithm for the optimal placement of the UAV. The proposed algorithm dynamically places the UAV in the network to reduce the distance between the GO and client devices. The expected benefits of the proposed scheme are to maintain the connectivity of client devices to increase the overall network throughput and to improve energy efficiency. As a proof of concept, realistic simulations are performed in the NS-3 network simulator to validate the claimed benefits of the proposed scheme. The simulation results report major improvements of 23% in client association, 54% in network throughput, and 33% in energy consumption using single UAV relative to the case of stationary or randomly moving GO. Further improvements are achieved by increasing the number of UAVs in the network. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work exists on the evaluation of the UAV-aided Wi-Fi Direct networks.",Drone,2019
Convolutional Neural Network-Based Real-Time Object Detection and Tracking for Parrot AR Drone 2,"Recent advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have provided an opportunity to create autonomous devices, robots, and machines characterized particularly with the ability to make decisions and perform tasks without human mediation. One of these devices, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones are widely used to perform tasks like surveillance, search and rescue, object detection and target tracking, parcel delivery (recently started by Amazon), and many more. The sensitivity in performing said tasks demands that drones must be efficient and reliable. For this, in this paper, an approach to detect and track the target object, moving or still, for a drone is presented. The Parrot AR Drone 2 is used for this application. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for object detection and target tracking. The object detection results show that CNN detects and classifies object with a high level of accuracy (98%). For real-time tracking, the tracking algorithm responds faster than conventionally used approaches, efficiently tracking the detected object without losing it from sight. The calculations based on several iterations exhibit that the efficiency achieved for target tracking is 96.5%.",Drone,2019

A UAV Platform Based on a Hyperspectral Sensor for Image Capturing and On-Board Processing,"Application-oriented solutions based on the combination of different technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), advanced sensors, precise GPS, and embedded devices have led to important improvements in the field of cyber-physical systems. Agriculture, due to its economic and social impact on the global population, arises as a potential domain which could enormously benefit from this paradigm in terms of savings in time, resources and human labor, not to mention aspects related to sustainability and environment respect. This has led to a new revolution named precision agriculture (or precision farming), based on observing and measuring inter and intra-field variability in crops. A key technology in this scenario is the use of hyperspectral imaging, firstly used in satellites and later in manned aircraft, composed by hundreds of spectral bands which facilitate hidden data to be converted into useful information. In this paper, a hyperspectral flying platform is presented and the construction of the whole system is detailed. The proposed solution is based on a commercial DJI Matrice 600 drone and a Specim FX10 hyperspectral camera. The challenge in this work has been to adopt this latter device, mainly conceived for industrial applications, into a flying platform in which weight, power budget, and connectivity are paramount. Additionally, an embedded board with advanced processing capabilities has been mounted on the drone in order to control its trajectory, manage the data acquisition, and allow on-board processing, such as the evaluation of different vegetation indices (the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI, the modified chlorophyll absorption ratio index, MCARI, and the modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, MSAVI), which are numerical and/or graphical indicators of the vegetation properties and compression, which is of crucial relevance due to the huge amounts of data captured. The whole system was successfully tested in a real scenario located on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain, where a vineyard area was inspected between May and August of the year 2018.",Drone,2019
An Optimized Image-Based Visual Servo Control for Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Target Tracking With Fixed Camera,"This paper presents an optimized image-based visual servo (IBVS) control scheme for tracking a ground target by using a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a monocular camera fixed on it. Unlike the widely used rotor UAVs, the fixed-wing UAV has much more dynamical constraints such as it cannot move omni-direction and its minimum speed is limited by the stalling speed. This makes the target tracking problem more challenging. The proposed scheme leverages the image Jacobian matrix to build a connection between the velocity of the feature point and that of the UAV. Afterward, considering the camera is fixed on the body of the UAV, an ""ideal camera"" model is proposed to compensate the shifts of the feature point caused by the changes of the UAV's attitude. Then, an optimized control law without solving the pseudo-inverse of the image Jacobian matrix is proposed with the aid of the least square method from the target center in the image coordinate system. This control law takes the velocity of the feature point as inputs and the yaw angular velocity of the UAV as outputs. The stability of the proposed law is analyzed with the Lyapunov method, showing that the UAV will circle around the ground target asymptotically. Finally, the proposed scheme is evaluated by a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation based on the Gazebo simulator and the off-the-shelf autopilot hardware.",Drone,2019
A QoE-Oriented Scheduling Scheme for Energy-Efficient Computation Offloading in UAV Cloud System,"Air ground integrated mobile cloud computing (MCC) provides UAVs with more flexibility and resilience from the cloud computing architecture. However, the increasing aerial mobile data requires heterogeneous quality of experience (QoE) for aerial accessing network. In addition, for the persistent flying, energy efficiency during the computation offloading should also be under consideration. This paper proposes an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme with the ability of QoE enhancement. Various aerial offloading data with different QoE requirements is stored and relayed in the multi-queueing architecture. Hence offloading rate differentiation is utilized to ensure the high-priority data a better QoE. The satisfaction function is designed with respect to energy efficiency and actual performance experienced by UAV. By using the Lyapunov optimization technique, the problem can be decoupled into two independent sub-problems. The first one is rate control associated with multi-queueing architecture in ground base-station (GBS) that manages the aerial offloading data from the UAVs according to the queue state information. The second one is resource allocation associated with the strategy of subcarrier assignment and power allocation according to the channel state information. The experiments demonstrate the algorithm has great properties such as maximization of the UAVs' satisfaction, the reliable heterogeneous QoE support and enhancement of the UAVs' transmission energy efficiency.",Drone,2019
"Fast DDL Classification for SAR Images With l(1,infinity) Constraint","Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification aims at labeling pixels with different categories and this is both, a fundamental step for automatic target recognition (ATR) and a prerequisite for further interpretation. In the past decades, various methods have been proposed for the classification of SAR targets and among them are discriminative dictionary learning (DDL) methods. These DDL methods have recently gained attention from researchers' community due to the fact that they are very powerful on both, representation and discrimination during the classification process of SAR images. However, most of the existing DDL methods adopt l(0)-norm or l(1)-norm to ensure the sparsity, but in general, these DDL methods suffer from a high computational burden. Furthermore, it is important to minimize the execution time in the phase of online testing for the scenario of onboard real-time or near real-time SAR automatic target recognition such as modern unmanned aerial vehicle SAR platforms. That said, on reducing execution time, we are confronted with the problem of enhancing recognition efficiency while maintaining its accuracy. In order to solve this problem, our paper proposes a fast DDL method (named as FaDDL) based on a nonlinear analysis co-sparse model by adopting an l(1,infinity)-norm ball as a constraint to replace l(0)-norm or l(1)-norm on the coding coefficient matrix. The experimental results show that our proposed method significantly reduces execution time, without losing the classification accuracy.",Drone,2019
Analysis on Displacement Characteristics of Slow-Moving Landslide on a slope near road Using the Topographic Map and Airborne LiDAR,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the displacement characteristics in slow-moving landslide area using digital elevation model and airborne LiDAR when unpredictable disaster such as slow-moving landslide occurred. We also aimed to provide basic data for establishing a rapid, reasonable and effective restoration plan. In this study, slow-moving landslide occurrence cracks were selected through the airborne LiDAR data, and the topographic changes and the scale of occurrence were quantitatively analyzed. As a result of the analysis, the study area showed horseshoe shape similar to the general form of slow-moving landslide occurrence in Korea, and the direction of movement was in the north direction. The total area of slow-moving landslide damage was estimated to about 2.5ha, length of landsldie scrap 327.3m, average width 19.3m, and average depth 8.6m. The slow-moving landslides did not occur on a large scale but occurred on the adjacent slope where roads were located, caused damage to retaining walls and roads. The field survey of slow-moving landslides was limited by accessibility and safety issues, but there was an advantage that accurate analysis was possible through the airborne LiDAR. However, because airborne LiDAR has costly disadvantages, it has proposed a technique to mount LiDAR on UAV for rapidity, long-term monitoring. In a slow-moving landslide damage area, information such as direction of movement of cracks and change of scale should be acquired continuously to be used in restoration planning and prevention of damage.",Drone,2019
emantic Segmentation of Drone Images Using Deep Learning Models Trained with National Geospatial Data,"Small, low-cost consumer drones have been attracting attention as a means of building new spatial information because they are technologically advanced very quickly. In order to efficiently utilize the large number of images acquired by the drone at different times, automatic analysis as well as acquisition ?¡¤ processing of the drones images are also very important. Semantic segmentation a key process of automatic analysis is especially necessary for change detection and object extraction. In this study, we train the deep learning model that performs semantic segmentation and evaluate the performance. In particular, we did not perform manual labeling for preparing training data, but utilized the pre-built national geospatial information that meets the geographical context of Korea. We performed semantic segmentation by training SegNet and PSPNet using general orthoimages, true orthoimages, and continuous digital maps (building and road layers). In terms of semantic segmentation, we could achieve maximum 86% accuracy using only the pre-built geospatial information. Based on this, it was able to effectively detect buildings by applying it to the new drone mosaic orthographic images of the test area. It is expected that the national geospatial information can be effectively used for training the deep learning models and contribute to automatic generation of geospatial information including change detection and object extraction in the future.",Drone,2019
Realization of Object Detection Algorithm and Eight-channel LiDAR sensor for Autonomous Vehicles,"The LiDAR sensor, which is widely regarded as one of the most important sensors, has recently undergone active commercialization owing to the significant growth in the production of ADAS and autonomous vehicle components. The LiDAR sensor technology involves radiating a laser beam at a particular angle and acquiring a three-dimensional image by measuring the lapsed time of the laser beam that has returned after being reflected. The LiDAR sensor has been incorporated and utilized in various devices such as drones and robots. This study focuses on object detection and recognition by employing sensor fusion. Object detection and recognition can be executed as a single function by incorporating sensors capable of recognition, such as image sensors, optical sensors, and propagation sensors. However, a single sensor has limitations with respect to object detection and recognition, and such limitations can be overcome by employing multiple sensors. In this paper, the performance of an eight-channel scanning LiDAR was evaluated and an object detection algorithm based on it was implemented. Furthermore, object detection characteristics during daytime and nighttime in a real road environment were verified. Obtained experimental results corroborate that an excellent detection performance of 92.87% can be achieved.",Drone,2019

Human detection of drone invasion in a low-altitude airspace: An application of signal detection theory,"A field study was conducted to investigate the sensitivity of human participants in detecting the invasion of a drone in the airspace. A Phantom 4 quadcopter was remotely controlled to hovering at air locations inside or outside of a stadium. Twenty participants were requested to determine whether the drone has invaded in the test field or not on a five-point scale. The participants also responded whether they have heard the sound of the drone. The nonparametric measures of the sensitivity of drone invasion detection, or P(A), were calculated. The results indicated that the distance between the drone and the boundary of the airspace significantly affected the P(A) while the effects of drone altitude were not significant. The participants were not unbiased detectors. They tended to respond ""probably yes,"" in general, when they spotted a drone near the airspace. The hearing of the sound of the drone provided partial cues in drone invasion detection.",Drone,2019
Design and Experimental Validation of a Robust Output Feedback Control for the Coupled Dynamics of a Micro Air Vehicle,"This paper addresses the design and experimental validation of a linear robust static output feedback controller for a 150 mm span fixed wing micro air vehicle (MAV).

In this paper, we proposed a new landing marker detection algorithm for autonomous landing systems in a real environment. We used an ellipse detection algorithm to detect the ellipse landmark or other elliptical objects. Furthermore, convolution neural networks were utilized to obtain the correct landmarks, which is robust, fast and can achieve a speed of 25 fps with 720p resolution video on an Intel NUC onboard computer. Unlike the other methods, the accuracy and speed of our algorithm is verified in a real-time application with more harsh conditions. During system testing, the flight system can detect the object above 20 m, track it, and automatically land on it with this vision algorithm. The algorithm has helped us achieve the first position at Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge in Abu Dhabi this year.",Drone,2019
"Vision techniques for on-board detection, following, and mapping of moving targets","This study presents computer vision modules of a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, which scored gold, silver, and bronze medals at the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge 2017. This autonomous system, which was running completely on board and in real time, had to address two complex tasks in challenging outdoor conditions. In the first task, an autonomous UAV had to find, track, and land on a human-driven car moving at 15 km/hr on a figure-eight-shaped track. During the second task, a group of three UAVs had to find small colored objects in a wide area, pick them up, and deliver them into a specified drop-off zone. The computer vision modules presented here achieved computationally efficient detection, accurate localization, robust velocity estimation, and reliable future position prediction of both the colored objects and the car. These properties had to be achieved in adverse outdoor environments with changing light conditions. Lighting varied from intense direct sunlight with sharp shadows cast over the objects by the UAV itself, to reduced visibility caused by overcast to dust and sand in the air. The results presented in this paper demonstrate good performance of the modules both during testing, which took place in the harsh desert environment of the central area of United Arab Emirates, as well as during the contest, which took place at a racing complex in the urban, near-sea location of Abu Dhabi. The stability and reliability of these modules contributed to the overall result of the contest, where our multi-UAV system outperformed teams from world's leading robotic laboratories in two challenging scenarios.",Drone,2019
Unsupervised learning-based flexible framework for surveillance planning with aerial vehicles,"The herein studied problem is motivated by practical needs of our participation in the Mohamed Bin Zayed International Robotics Challenge (MBZIRC) 2017 in which a team of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is requested to collect objects in the given area as quickly as possible and score according to the rewards associated with the objects. The mission time is limited, and the most time-consuming operation is the collection of the objects themselves. Therefore, we address the problem to quickly identify the most valuable objects as surveillance planning with curvature-constrained trajectories. The problem is formulated as a multivehicle variant of the Dubins traveling salesman problem with neighborhoods (DTSPN). Based on the evaluation of existing approaches to the DTSPN, we propose to use unsupervised learning to find satisfiable solutions with low computational requirements. Moreover, the flexibility of unsupervised learning allows considering trajectory parametrization that better fits the motion constraints of the utilized hexacopters that are not limited by the minimal turning radius as the Dubins vehicle. We propose to use Bezier curves to exploit the maximal vehicle velocity and acceleration limits. Besides, we further generalize the proposed approach to 3D surveillance planning. We report on evaluation results of the developed algorithms and experimental verification of the planned trajectories using the real UAVs utilized in our participation in MBZIRC 2017.",Drone,2019
Multiple Maneuvering Target Tracking Using a Single Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"This paper solves the problem of tracking multiple maneuvering ground targets using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The targets are widespread so that they may not be covered by the UAV's detection range simultaneously. Such a strategy is applied in which, whenever it is unable to detect all the targets, the UAV temporarily covers only some of the targets and goes back to the lost targets later. A recursive Bayesian estimation algorithm is proposed to keep track of the lost targets; a guidance objective function is then formulated to minimize the tracking uncertainty. By integrating the proposed estimation and the guidance methods, an efficient closed-loop multitarget tracking algorithm is developed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated with illustrative numerical examples.",Drone,2019
Positive Nonlinear Systems Synthesis Based on Optimal Control Methods,"This paper considers a nonlinear positive control system of autonomous intellectual agent's motions. Single or multiple intellectual agents are capable of independent decision-making to achieve an odor source or radioactive source. Various biologically inspired behaviour-based approaches, such as chemotaxis, the moth inspired casting algorithm, flocking behavior and foraging, population development or species interaction are used for creation of control system of an intellectual agent. The agent is a tracking system, for example, unmanned aerial vehicle or a multicopter. The intellectual agent searches hazardous pollutants in dangerous environments. The task of a flying robot is to find the source of invisible pollutions. The aim of this work is to synthesize the control law, that provides a predetermined degree of exponential stability in a closed-loop positive system based on Lotka-Volterra equations. The methods of optimal control theory are used in the synthesis of the system. Asymptotic stability is achieved by solving the Riccati equation. The stability of the control system is an important criterion of quality to be ensured. Therefore, the intellectual agent is able to control the movements to the right and to the left, reaching the source. With the model proposed we provide the simulation and experimental results, which correspond to the quality metrics required. In this work, the control system has a given degree of exponential stability and the transient response, which confirms the possibility of using the model proposed in terrestrial mobile robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles and other robots in searching a large area.",Drone,2019
Choosing a Variety of Priority Surface Observation Objects with the Help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Routing their Flight,"The work solves the initial selection task of plurality of the most important ground objects observed, which should be included in flight plan of an unmanned aerial vehicles. A method for generating a set of priority observing objects using dynamic programming is given, taking into account the variable importance of observation objects and the time when there is no control over objects of observation. The formula for calculating the dynamic priority is obtained.

Studying the Impact of Active Network Attacks on a Mobile Robots Group,"Purpose: Developing a procedure to analyze the effectiveness of active network attacks affecting cyber parameters of a mobile robots group.Research methods: Based on using mathematical statistics to analyze the results and statistical information obtained by modeling the behavior of a mobile robots group. The procedure includes a sequence of calculations and their evaluation in order to identify anomalies in the network. Results: A statistical analysis of changes in the network node parameters during and in the absence of attack was conducted. A set of parameters affected by various attacks was determined. Scenarios for active network attacks that take into account varying degrees of attack intensity were developed and implemented. If fine-tuned, these scenarios can form the basis of the procedure for analyzing security of the mobile robots group. A procedure for assessing the network effectiveness and detecting anomalous node behavior was developed. An experimental study was conducted that identified parameter sets for each attack, which should be analyzed whenever an attack is detected. A network of mobile robots, especially drones, can work for a limited amount of time, so the attack effectiveness and intensity play a key role in influencing the network. The study helps determine when the effect is maximum, so that the risk of possible impact can be subsequently reduced. Furthermore, the study is auxiliary for developing an attack detection system, since it reveals new dependencies and allows one to evaluate the impact of attacks on changes in traffic patterns and node behavior. The key applications of this work are information security and countering cyber security threats.",Drone,2019
Disturbances rejection based on sliding mode control,"Purpose The purpose of this paper aims to investigate an effective algorithm for different types of disturbances rejection. New dynamics are designed based on disturbance. Observer-based sliding mode control (SMC) technique is used for approximation the disturbances as well as to stabilize the system effectively in presence of uncertainties.Design/methodology/approach This research work investigates the disturbances rejection algorithm for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle. An algorithm based on SMC is introduced for disturbances rejection. Two types of disturbances are considered, the constant disturbance and the sinusoidal disturbance. The comprehensive lateral and longitudinal models of the system are presented. Two types of dynamics, the dynamics without disturbance and the new dynamics with disturbance, are presented. An observer-based algorithm is presented for the estimation of the dynamics with disturbances. Intensive simulations and experiments have been performed; the results not only guarantee the robustness and stability of the system but the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm as well.Findings In previous research work, new dynamics based on disturbances rejection are not investigated in detail; in this research work both the lateral and longitudinal dynamics with different disturbances are investigated.Practical implications As the stability is always important for flight, so the algorithm proposed in this research guarantees the robustness and rejection of disturbances, which plays a vital role in practical life for avoiding any kind of damage.Originality/value In the previous research work, new dynamics based on disturbances rejection are not investigated in detail; in this research work both the lateral and longitudinal dynamics with different disturbances are investigated.

Model predictive cooperative localization control of multiple UAVs using potential function sensor constraints: A workflow to create sensor constraint based potential functions for the control of cooperative localization scenarios with mobile robots,"The global localization of multiple mobile robots can be achieved cost efficiently by localizing one robot globally and the others in relation to it using local sensor data. However, the drawback of this cooperative localization is the requirement of continuous sensor information. Due to a limited sensor perception space, the tracking task to continuously maintain this sensor information is challenging. To address this problem, this contribution is presenting a model predictive control (MPC) approach for such cooperative localization scenarios. In particular, the present work shows a novel workflow to describe sensor limitations with the help of potential functions. In addition, a compact motion model for multi-rotor drones is introduced to achieve MPC real-time capability. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated in a numerical simulation, an experimental indoor scenario with two quadrotors as well as multiple indoor scenarios of a quadrotor obstacle evasion maneuver.",Drone,2019
Dynamics Modeling and Stability Analysis of Tilt Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle During Transition,"In the transition mode of quad tilt wing-unmanned aerial vehicle (QTW-UAV), the system stability of UAV will change with the tilt angle changes, which will cause serious head drop down. Meanwhile, with the complex air flow and other disturbances, the system is prone to side bias, frying, stall and other kinetic stability problems, hence the system stability analysis has become an urgent problem to be solved. To solve the stability problem, we need the quantitative criteria of system stability and effective tool of stability analysis, and can improve the stability of the motion control by optimizing the structural parameters of the aircraft. Therefore, based on the design of the mechanical structure, the quantitative relationship between the structure parameters of the aerial vehicle and kinetic stability of the system transition mode is established by the Lyapunov exponent method. In this paper, the dynamic modeling of the position and attitude angle is carried out and the stability of the system is analyzed by Lyapunov exponent, the results show that changing the mechanical structure of the system can improve the flight stability for the system transition mode and lay a theoretical foundation for the system stability analysis. Compared with the Lyapunov direct method, this method can be construct easily, has a simple calculation process and so on. We improve the flight stability by optimizing the structure and the experiment confirms that expanding area can enhance flight stability within limits.",Drone,2019
Uncertainty-based design optimization of NLF airfoil for high altitude long endurance unmanned air vehicles,"Purpose The high probability of the occurrence of separation bubbles or shocks and early transition to turbulence on surfaces of airfoil makes it very difficult to design high-lift and high-speed Natural-Laminar-Flow (NLF) airfoil for high-altitude long-endurance unmanned air vehicles. To resolve this issue, a framework of uncertainty-based design optimization (UBDO) is developed based on an adjusted polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method.Design/methodology/approach The Re-t transition model combined with the shear stress transport k- turbulence model is used to predict the laminar-turbulent transition. The particle swarm optimization algorithm and PCE are integrated to search for the optimal NLF airfoil. Using proposed UBDO framework, the aforementioned problem has been regularized to achieve the optimal airfoil with a tradeoff of aerodynamic performances under fully turbulent and free transition conditions. The tradeoff is to make sure its good performance when early transition to turbulence on surfaces of NLF airfoil happens.Findings The results indicate that UBDO of NLF airfoil considering Mach number and lift coefficient uncertainty under free transition condition shows a significant deterioration when complicated flight conditions lead to early transition to turbulence. Meanwhile, UBDO of NLF airfoil with a tradeoff of performances under both fully turbulent and free transition conditions holds robust and reliable aerodynamic performance under complicated flight conditions.Originality/value In this work, the authors build an effective uncertainty-based design framework based on an adjusted PCE method and apply the framework to design two high-performance NLF airfoils. One of the two NLF airfoils considers Mach number and lift coefficient uncertainty under free transition condition, and the other considers uncertainties both under fully turbulent and free transition conditions. The results show that robust design of NLF airfoil should simultaneously consider Mach number, lift coefficient (angle of attack) and transition location uncertainty.",Drone,2019
Deep Learning-Based Super-Resolution Reconstruction and Marker Detection for Drone Landing,"There have been a significant number of recent studies on autonomous landing in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Early studies employed a global positioning system (GPS) receivers for this purpose. However, because GPS signals cannot be used in certain urban environments, prior studies used vision-based marker detection. To accurately detect a marker, a high-resolution camera on a drone must obtain a high-quality image. This can not only be expensive but also increases the weight of the drone. In general, drones are only equipped with a frontal-viewing and fixed angle camera, and an additional downward-viewing camera becomes necessary for drone landing. Therefore, expensive and weighted high-resolution cameras are not feasible for use on drones. Nevertheless, most previous studies on vision-based drone landing use high-resolution images. To address such limitations, we propose a new method of drone landing using deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection on an image captured by a cost-effective and low-resolution visible light camera. The experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits higher performance than the existing methods in terms of super-resolution reconstruction and marker detection.",Drone,2019
Swarm Intelligence-Inspired Autonomous Flocking Control in UAV Networks,"The collaboration of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has stimulated the emergence of a novel wireless network paradigm named UAV network. UAV network, compared with uncoordinated UAV systems could provide wider coverage, better monitoring, and understanding of the interested area, and smarter decision-making. However, realizing the full potential of UAV network in dynamic environments poses great challenges in topology/flocking control, energy conservation, and quality of service guarantee. In this backdrop, this paper proposes a swarm intelligence-inspired autonomous flocking control scheme for UAV networks. First, based on the concept of intelligent emergence of swarm agents, a swarm intelligence-inspired multi-layer flocking control scheme is built for the flocking control problem. Second, an integrated sensing and communication method is put forward to regulate how a UAV can calculate its distances to its neighbors and its deflection angle. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted on our simulator developed on OMNeT++ and the flocking prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The simulation and experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme could realize efficient flocking control with low energy consumption and satisfied the quality of service.",Drone,2019
STAP-Based Airborne Radar System for Maneuvering Target Detection,"With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), techniques are required for the detection and surveillance of such UAVs for both civil and military purposes.

A general signal model is established for the moving target, where the target is parameterized with angle, velocity, acceleration, and backscattering coefficient. A general adaptive matched filtering method is proposed involving multiple-dimensional search. An enhanced approach is devised by using a discrete searching technique within the acceleration dimension in order to reduce the computational complexity. The simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Hello Interval in FANET Routing Protocols for Green UAVs,"With the recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the development of energy-efficient networking technology for mission-oriented multiple cooperative UAVs has become crucial. Routing in flying ad-hoc networks (FANETs) with UAVs is a challenging issue because of the high speed and sudden changes in direction of UAVs. Traditional routing protocols in FANETs periodically send hello messages for the establishment and maintenance of the routes. However, sending hello messages periodically after a fixed interval increases bandwidth wastage when the hello interval is excessively short or causes long delays in neighbour discovery when the hello interval is overly long. Moreover, several disconnected UAV groups have been observed in which the group members are connected among themselves but detached from the main network. By exchanging excessive hello messages inside the group, the UAVs maintain an unnecessary neighbourhood, causing wastage of energy. However, FANETs have certain advantages, such as knowledge about mission-related information. To solve the problem of unnecessary energy drain, we propose a novel adaptive hello interval scheme of energy efficient hello (EE-Hello)-based on available mission-related information, such as the volume of the allowed airspace, number of UAVs, UAV-transmission range, and UAV speed. We present a method to decide the distance that a UAV needs to travel before sending a hello message. We also specify a technique to determine the number of UAVs necessary to achieve specific network requirements, such as packet delivery ratio or throughput, with the expenditure of minimum energy. We show that the proposed EE-Hello can save about 25% of the energy currently used, by suppressing unnecessary hello messages without degrading the overall network throughput.",Drone,2019
"Cooperative Routing Problem for Ground Vehicle and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: The Application on Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Missions","In this paper, we investigate a novel two-echelon ground vehicle and its mounted unmanned aerial vehicle cooperative routing problem (2E-GUCRP) for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. In a typical cooperative system with ground vehicle (GV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the UAV is launched from the GV, automatically flies to the designated target and return to the GV before powering off. Meanwhile, acting as a mobile platform, the GV can carry the UAV moving in a larger region and charge or exchange the UAV's battery. The objective is to design efficient GV and UAV routes to minimize the total mission time while meeting the operational constraints. A mixed integer programming (MIP) model, which could be solved by commercial software (e.g. CPLEX), is developed to formulate the problem. In order to quickly solve the medium-scale or above problems, two heuristics are designed. The random instances and practical case based on the road network in Changsha, China, are used for experiments. The computational results indicate that, compared to the mode of two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), the cooperative GV and UAV can complete the ISR missions in a much shorter time through utilizing the proposed 2E-GUCRP mode. Furthermore, discussion of the practical instance points out that the increase in efficiency is related to the speed relationship between the GV and the UAV.",Drone,2019
Energy Efficient Estimation in Wireless Sensor Network With Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Distributed estimation is a typical application of wireless sensor network (WSN), where a set of sensor nodes (SNs) collaboratively estimate some parameters of interest from noisy measurements. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled WSN has attracted significant interest since the UAV can collect data energy-efficiently due to its high mobility. In this paper, we consider the joint optimization of UAV trajectory design and SNs' transmission bits allocation for estimating an unknown parameter in UAV-enabled WSN, and the objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of all SNs under the constraint that the mean square error (MSE) of estimation is below a target threshold. The joint optimization problem is formulated with mixed-integer non-convex programming, which is difficult to solve in general. As such, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. A low-complexity and systematic initialization scheme is also proposed for the trajectory design and transmission bits allocation based on the trade-off structure on the number of visited SNs for estimation. The extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the significant performance gains in terms of total energy consumption of all SNs as compared with other benchmark schemes.",Drone,2019
Cooperative time-varying formation guidance for leader-following missiles to intercept a maneuvering target with switching topologies,This study investigates the cooperative time-varying formation guidance (CTFG) problem for leader-following missiles to intercept a maneuvering target with switching communication topologies. Multiple missiles are classified into a leader missile and multiple follower missiles. The leader missile intercepts the maneuvering target under the modified proportional navigation guidance law. The follower missiles are expected to form a predefined time-varying formation and track the trajectory of the leader missile. Multiple missiles intercept the maneuvering target simultaneously and then form a many-to-one engagement. A four-step approach to determine the parameters in the CTFG law is given. The convergence of the approach is discussed. A numerical example for multiple missiles intercepting a maneuvering target subjected to switching communication topologies is presented.,Drone,2019
Localized Fault Tolerant Algorithm Based on Node Movement Freedom Degree in Flying Ad Hoc Networks,"Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a communication network for data transmission among Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In ad hoc network, the UAVs movement is usually applied to improve network fault-tolerance, but it easily causes the disconnection of communication links, and the success rate is low. In this paper, we propose a local fault-tolerant control algorithm based on node movement freedom degree (LFTMF). Under the constraint of node movement freedom degree, the algorithm transforms the single-connected network into bi-connected network through the autonomous movement of UAVs to improve the fault-tolerant ability of the FANET network. Firstly, the consistency between k-hop cut-points and global cut-points in FANET network is analyzed. Then, based on the k-hop local topology of FANET network, the UAV node movement freedom degree model is established. Finally, according to the location distribution of k-hop cut-points in the FANET network, the bi-connected fault-tolerant network is realized by UAVs cascade movement. Compared with the existing algorithms, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance in success rate, deviation distance, cascade movement ratio and adjustment period.",Drone,2019
A neurobiologically-inspired intelligent trajectory tracking control for unmanned aircraft systems with uncertain system dynamics and disturbance,"In this paper, a novel neurobiologically-inspired intelligent tracking controller is developed and implemented for unmanned aircraft systems in the presence of uncertain system dynamics and disturbance. The methodology adopted, known as Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC), is based on a novel computational model of emotional learning within brain limbic systems in mammals. Compared to conventional model-based control methods, BELBICs are more suitable for practical unmanned aircraft systems since they can maintain the real-time unmanned aircraft system performance without known system dynamics and disturbance. Furthermore, the learning capability and low computational complexity of BELBIC mean that it is very promising for implementation in complex real-time applications. Moreover, we proved that our proposed methodology guarantees convergence. To evaluate the practical performance of our proposed design, BELBIC has been implemented into a benchmark unmanned aircraft system. Numerical and experimental results demonstrated the applicability and satisfactory performance of the proposed BELBIC-inspired design.",Drone,2019
A geometrical closed form solution for RSS based far-field localization: Direction of Exponent Uncertainty,"In this study, a new powerful geometrical closed-form solution called Direction of Exponent Uncertainty (DEU) is proposed for received signal strength (RSS) based far-field localization when path loss exponent (PLE) and transmit power are both unknown. The uncertainty in the PLE due to environmental factors is a significant challenge for RSS based localization. DEU is built after careful investigation of geometrical behaviors of differential received signal strength circles, i.e. the locus of possible location of the emitter when transmit power is unknown. It is shown that the uncertainty in the PLE corresponds to a linear uncertainty for the location of the emitter in two dimensional space. This critical observation creates a basis for the sensor to move towards the emitter without estimating the emitter location after only three measurements. Furthermore, with only four different measurements, it is possible to effectively estimate the location of the emitter as well as the PLE by means of intersection of DEUs. Intersection of DEUs attains Cramer Rao Lower Bound with a dramatically reduced execution time compared to nonlinear least squares estimator. DEU is also proposed as an efficient route planning tool for moving sensors such as unmanned aerial vehicles.",Drone,2019
Coalition formation among unmanned aerial vehicles for uncertain task allocation,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), mobile stations and self-operation sensor nodes consist a potential next generation wireless network. The key problem is task allocation among agents to accomplish tasks. In this paper, the self-organizing UAVs networks model is considered which a number of data packets from sensor nodes are collected by several UAVs to send to the control center. The data collection problem is considered as the task allocation problem. Most literatures about task allocation problem consider the tasks are static which the information of the task is completely known. However, due to the dynamic environment of task, the status, and locations of tasks varying dynamically, the task is uncertain because the information of the task is incompletely known by UAVs. In this paper, the uncertain task allocation problem among UAVs is modeled as Bayesian coalition formation. Each formed coalition consists of tasks and UAVs who move among various tasks in the coalition using polling scheme. The Bayesian coalition game based on possible environments is proposed to model the interaction between uncertain tasks and UAVs in coalition formation. According to the achieved utility and cost in the features of the throughput and delay, members in the coalition make distributed decisions to leave or join in the coalition. A belief update mechanism of uncertain tasks is used to calculate the probability that the task is in the range of potential coalition in each environment. Simulation results demonstrate that the Nash stable coalition structure can be obtained depending on the proposed Bayesian coalition formation algorithm. The Nash stable coalition structures with incomplete information and complete information converge to the same coalitional structure.",Drone,2019
"A design modification for a quadrotor UAV: modeling, control and implementation","Conventional quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles have crucial underactuation limitations. This appears in the coupling between the roll angle and movement along the y-direction, and between the pitch angle and movement along the x-direction. The quadrotor capability of hovering with either roll or pitch angle is restricted due to these limitations. In this paper, a design modification, with experimental verification, is proposed in order to increase the quadrotor degrees of freedom and improve its hovering capability. Four additional rotations for the propellers about the axes perpendicular to the arms grant overactuated system. It could be used to make a horizontal movement with zero inclination angle which is followed in this work as an example for the skills acquired by the quadrotor due to the proposed design. Choosing different tilting axes, rather than the mostly considered ones in previous work which are about the ones along the arms, enhances the advantages of this modification. The benefits are to increase the degrees of freedom and improve the hovering of the quadrotor as well. A PID controller is utilized for practical implementation of the proposed design. Simulation and experimental results show the validity of the proposed design.",Drone,2019
UAVs assisted queue scheduling in ground ad hoc networks,"Hybrid networks provide a vast range of applications in areas of military and civilian activities. One of the examples of hybrid network formations is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) assisted ground ad hoc networks. Efficient coordination in these networks can resolve complex issues such as coverage, proper connectivity, scalability, and QoS. However, reliable data transmission with enhanced QoS is one of the key challenges in these types of hybrid ad hoc formations. In this paper, an efficient queue scheduling approach is proposed that allows improved QoS to end users. The proposed queue scheduling approach is developed in two parts. The first part utilises the Quaternion based Kalman Filter to find the appropriate locations for placement of each UAV. In the second part, satisfied importance analysis (SIA) is used to find the governing rules for the selection of appropriate queue for transmission. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated using simulations.",Drone,2019
Multistage bayesian autonomy for high-precision operation in a large field,"This paper presents a generalized multistage bayesian framework to enable an autonomous robot to complete high-precision operations on a static target in a large field. The proposed framework consists of two multistage approaches, capable of dealing with the complexity of high-precision operation in a large field to detect and localize the target. In the multistage localization, locations of the robot and the target are estimated sequentially when the target is far away from the robot, whereas these locations are estimated simultaneously when the target is close. A level of confidence (LOC) for each detection criterion of a sensor and the associated probability of detection (POD) of the sensor are defined to make the target detectable with different LOCs at varying distances. Differential entropies of the robot and target are used as a precision metric for evaluating the performance of the proposed approach. The proposed multistage observation and localization approaches were applied to scenarios using an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Results with the UGV in simulated environments and then real environments show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches to real-world problems. A successful demonstration using the UAV is also presented.",Drone,2019

The lift and thrust aerodynamic characteristics were analyzed to get some relative characteristic and the aerodynamic coupling relationships between the fixed wings and tail propulsion system. And an optimization method based on hybrid Fuzzy-PSO (HFPSO) algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal configuration plan that can reach the best aerodynamic performance without considering the coaxial architecture. The optimal configuration plan was finally obtained by applying the HFPSO method which also proves the method is effective and reasonable through comparison.",Drone,2019
An evaluation of image-based structural health monitoring using integrated unmanned aerial vehicle platform,"Increasing number of skyscrapers along with the large number of tall bridges in the urban setting throughout the world also increases the demand of robust and autonomously controlled structural health monitoring (SHM) in order to enhance the reliability of such structures and their surroundings. In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based autonomous SHM system has been investigated, in which the images of the structural site captured by the UAV were stitched together to form the complete view of the structure. The image-stitching task has been done by using a well-known speeded up robust features (SURF)-based feature detection algorithm. The large number of features resulting from SURF are first reduced with random sample consensus algorithm and then the respective transformations are applied to align the images for final stitching. The comparison between the current and previous view of the structural site provides the structural differences. The proposed approach is tested on a sample structure in a lab with different possible realistic types of defects that are induced in the structure, and the performance of the proposed methodology is compared with the existing approaches. It has been shown that the proposed system can perform image stitching even if the UAV suffers angular displacement due to wind thrusts or calibration issues. The proposed approach has also been applied on a concrete structure, and the displacement detected on the column of the structure's backyard verified the feasibility for real-world SHM.",Drone,2019
Investigation of design parameters of the two stage rotary turbine,"Unmanned aerial vehicles and hybrid cars, which are currently being studied extensively, require high effiency and power-to-weight ratio engines. The Pars engine, which is a rotary engine that have the potential to provide these desired characteristics, consisting of compressor, combustion chamber and turbine, is similar to the single vane rotary refrigerant compressors and expanders used in the industry. In this study, a new two-stage turbine was designed in place of the Pars turbine, which has a rotary valve system. Expansion ratio, eccentricity ratio, volume ratio, phase difference angle were determined as design parameters and theoretical moment values were obtained. In the theoretical calculations made, a torque increase of 47% vas obtained for equal inlet time angels relative to the rotary valve system in the two-stage turbine.",Drone,2019
Automatic landing of a low-cost quadrotor using monocular vision and Kalman filter in GPS-denied environments,"Unmanned aerial vehicles are becoming an important part of the modern life. Despite some recent advances in GPS-aided navigation of quadrotors, the concern of crash and collision still overshadows their reliability and safety, especially in GPS-denied environments. Therefore, the necessity for developing fully automatic methods for safe, accurate, and independent landing of drones increases over time. This paper investigates the autolanding process by focusing on an accurate and continuous position estimation of the drone using a monocular vision system and the fusion with the inertial measurement unit and ultrasonic sensors' data. An ARUCO marker is used as the landing pad, and the information is processed in the ground station through a real-time Wi-Fi link. In order to overcome the closed loop instability caused by the communication and localization delays, we propose a method called ""movement slicing method"". This method divides the moves around the marker into moving and waiting slices and makes the landing process not only more accurate but also faster. Experimental results show a successful landing of the UAV on a predefined location, while it is accurately aligned with the marker using the proposed method.",Drone,2019
A Trajectory Prediction Based Intelligent Handover Control Method in UAV Cellular Networks,"The airborne base station (ABS) can provide wireless coverage to the ground in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cellular networks. When mobile users move among adjacent ABSs, the measurement information reported by a single mobile user is used to trigger the handover mechanism. This handover mechanism lacks the consideration of movement state of mobile users and the location relationship between mobile users, which may lead to handover misjudgments and even communication interrupts. In this paper, we propose an intelligent handover control method in UAV cellular networks. Firstly, we introduce a deep learning model to predict the user trajectories. This prediction model learns the movement behavior of mobile users from the measurement information and analyzes the positional relations between mobile users such as avoiding collision and accommodating fellow pedestrians. Secondly, we propose a handover decision method, which can calculate the users' corresponding receiving power based on the predicted location and the characteristic of air-to-ground channel. to make handover decisions accurately. Finally, we use realistic data sets with thousands of non-linear trajectories to verify the basic functions and performance of our proposed intelligent handover control method. The simulation results show that the handover success rate of the proposed method is 8% higher than existing methods.",Drone,2019
Distributed Transmit Beamforming for UAV to Base Communications,"Distributed transmit beamforming (DTB) is very efficient for extending the communication distance between a swarm of UAVs and the base, particularly when considering the constraints in weight and battery life for payloads on UAVs. In this paper, we review major function modules and potential solutions in realizing DTB in UAV systems, such as timing and carrier synchronization, phase drift tracking and compensation, and beamforming vector generation and updating. We then focus on beamforming vector generation and updating, and introduce a concatenated training scheme, together with a recursive channel estimation and updating algorithm. We also propose three approaches for tracking the variation of channels and updating the vectors. The effectiveness of these approaches is validated by simulation results.",Drone,2019
An Energy Efficient Design for UAV Communication With Mobile Edge Computing,"This paper considers a UAV communication system with mobile edge computing (MEC). We minimize the energy consumption of the whole system via jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and task assignment as well as CPU's computational speed under the set of resource constrains. To this end, we first derive the energy consumption model of data processing, and then obtain the energy consumption model of fixed-wing UAV's flight. The optimization problem is mathematically formulated. To address the problem, we first obtain the approximate optimization problem by applying the technique of discrete linear state-space approximation, and then transform the non-convex constraints into convex by using linearization. Furthermore, a concave-convex procedure (CCCP) based algorithm is proposed in order to solve the optimization problem approximately. Numerical results show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.",Drone,2019
MmWave Beamforming for UAV Communications with Unstable Beam Pointing,"Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have drawn dramatic attentions for its flexibility on a variety of applications. Recently, channel tracking base on the spatial features has been proposed to solve the problem of beam misalignments due to the UAV navigation. However, unstable beam pointing caused by the non-ideal beam tracking environment may impact the performance of mmWave systems significantly. in this paper, an improved beamforming method is presented to overcome this shortcoming. Firstly, the effect of the beam deviation is analyzed through the establishment of the equivalent data rate. Then, combining the quantification of spatial angle and the improved orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm, an optimized beam corresponding to the beam deviation is obtained. Simulation results show that the optimized beam of the proposed approach can effectively improve the spectral efficiency without improving the complexity when the beam pointing is unstable.",Drone,2019
Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation for Multi-UAV Systems,"This paper investigates subcarrier and power allocation in a multi-UAV OFDM system. The study considers a practical scenario, where certain subcarriers are unavailable for dynamic subcarrier allocation, on account of pre-allocation for burst transmissions. We first propose a novel iterative algorithm to jointly optimize subcarrier and power allocation, so as to maximize the sum rate of the uplink transmission in the multiUAV OFDM system. The key idea behind our solution is converting the nontrivial allocation problem into a weighted mean square error (MSE) problem. By this means, the allocation problem can be solved by the alternating optimization method. Besides, aiming at a lower-complexity solution, we propose a heuristic allocation scheme, where subcarrier allocation and transmit power allocation are separately optimized. In the heuristic scheme, closedform solution can be obtained for power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that in the presence of stretched subcarrier resource, the proposed iterative joint optimization algorithm can significantly outperform the heuristic scheme, offering a higher sum rate.",Drone,2019
Pricing Based Power Control for Inter-Cell UAV-Assisted Vehicle-to-Vehicle Underlay Communication,"The high-capacity vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication provides a promising solution to support ubiquitous media streaming and content sharing among vehicles. To extend the V2V links to multiple cells and manage the inter-cell interference, we proposed an UAV-assisted inter-cell V2V communication model, in which a shared UAV node is placed in the center of V2V users. By charging the V2V users underlay spectrum access fee, the cellular network earn profit at the cost of encountering co-channel interference from V2V links. A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between the V2V links and the cellular links, which are the game follower and the leader respectively. Their utility functions are maximized in terms of accessing price as well as transmit power of V2V users and UAV relays. Simulation evaluations verify that the power-price tradeoff between V2V network and cellular network has significant potentials to enhance their utility.",Drone,2019
Modeling novel methodologies for unmanned aerial systems - Applications to the UAS-S4 Ehecatl and the UAS-S45 Balaam,"The rising demand for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) to perform tasks in hostile environments has emphasized the need for their simulation models for the preliminary evaluations of their missions. The efficiency of the UAS model is directly related to its capacity to estimate its flight dynamics with minimum computational resources. The literature describes several techniques to estimate accurate aircraft flight dynamics. Most of them are based on system identification. This paper presents an alternative methodology to obtain complete model of the S4 and S45 unmanned aerial systems. The UAS-S4 and the UAS-S45 models were divided into four sub-models, each corresponding to a specific discipline: aerodynamics, propulsion, mass and inertia, and actuator. The ""aerodynamic"" sub-model was built using the Fderivatives in-house code, which is an improvement of the classical DATCOM procedure. The ""propulsion"" sub-model was obtained by coupling a two-stroke engine model based on the ideal Otto cycle and a Blade Element Theory (BET) analysis of the propeller. The ""mass and the inertia"" sub-model was designed utilizing the Raymer and DATCOM methodologies. A sub-model of an actuator using servomotor characteristics was employed to complete the model. The total model was then checked by validation of each sub-model with numerical and experimental data. The results indicate that the obtained model was accurate and could be used to design a flight simulator. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

Evolution analysis of a UAV real-time operating system from a network perspective,"With the flourishing development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the mission tasks of UAVs have become more and more complex. Consequently, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that provides operating environments for various mission services on these UAVs has become crucial, which leads to the necessity of having a deep understanding of an RTOS. In this paper, an empirical study is conducted on FreeRTOS, a commonly used RTOS for UAVs, from a complex network perspective. A total of 85 releases of FreeRTOS, from V2.4.2 to V10.0.0, are modeled as directed networks, in which the nodes represent functions and the edges denote function calls. It is found that the size of the FreeRTOS network has grown almost linearly with the evolution of the versions, while its main core has evolved steadily. In addition, a k-core analysis-based metric is proposed to identify major functionality changes of FreeRTOS during its evolution. The result shows that the identified versions are consistent with the version change logs. Finally, it is found that the clustering coefficient of the Linux OS scheduler is larger than that of the Free-RTOS scheduler. In conclusion, the empirical results provide useful guidance for developers and users of UAV RTOSs. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

LSAR: Multi-UAV Collaboration for Search and Rescue Missions,"In this paper, we consider the use of a team of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to accomplish a search and rescue (SAR) mission in the minimum time possible while saving the maximum number of people. A novel technique for the SAR problem is proposed and referred to as the layered search and rescue (LSAR) algorithm. The novelty of LSAR involves simulating real disasters to distribute SAR tasks among UAVs. The performance of LSAR is compared, in terms of percentage of rescued survivors and rescue and execution times, with the max-sum, auction-based, and locust-inspired approaches for multi UAV task allocation (LIAM) and opportunistic task allocation (OTA) schemes. The simulation results show that the UAVs running the LSAR algorithm on average rescue approximately 74% of the survivors, which is 8% higher than the next best algorithm (LIAM). Moreover, this percentage increases with the number of UAVs, almost linearly with the least slope, which means more scalability and coverage is obtained in comparison to other algorithms. In addition, the empirical cumulative distribution function of LSAR results shows that the percentages of rescued survivors clustered around the [78% - 100%] range under an exponential curve, meaning most results are above 50%. In comparison, all the other algorithms have almost equal distributions of their percentage of rescued survivor results. Furthermore, because the LSAR algorithm focuses on the center of the disaster, it finds more survivors and rescues them faster than the other algorithms, with an average of 55% similar to 77%. Moreover, most registered times to rescue survivors by LSAR are bounded by a time of 04:50:02 with 95% confidence for a one-month mission time.",Drone,2019
A Recognition Technology of Transmission Lines Conductor Break and Surface Damage Based on Aerial Image,"The aluminum strands break and surface damage will gradually develop into irreversible destruction to the conductors and the whole transmission lines, and even lead to serious power outages. In order to find out the potential strands break and damage faults and prevent its further deterioration, a recognition method of conductor break and surface defects in transmission lines' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) inspection is presented in this paper. First, a conductor image is obtained by the UAV image acquisition system, and then, the conductor region is extracted by the adaptive threshold segmentation after the enhancement processing by the gray variance normalization method (GVN). Second, the conductor break is detected by the square wave transformation (SWT) of its grayscale distribution curves, which is simple and effective. Meanwhile, the conductor surface defects are identified by the projection algorithm of the GVN image of the conductor region. Finally, calculating the number of broken strands and filtering the suspect defects, the final fault diagnosis results can be obtained. We analyze the performance of the technology by a series of experiments, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can measure the conductor break and surface defects faults with the average accuracy of 90.45% and 92.05%, respectively. The health condition of the conductor can be monitored based on the method presented in this paper, by which the safe operation of transmission lines can be guaranteed.",Drone,2019
An Efficient Solution for Joint Power and Trajectory Optimization in UAV-Enabled Wireless Network,"The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as aerial communication platforms has gained significant attention due to their favorable air-to-ground channels, on-demand deployment, and highly controllable mobility. In this paper, we aim at developing an efficient algorithm for the joint transmit power and UAV trajectory design via maximizing the minimum average throughput in a UAV-enabled network. The conventional method to tackle this problem is to optimize transmit power or trajectory in an alternative manner, which generally incurs high computational complexities. Moreover, how to find a favorable initial point is a challenging task. To this end, we impose a novel constraint by assuming that the UAV will not communicate until it approaches the closest position to a user, thus transforming the initial problem into an approximate one with reduced variables. Based on this result, we further propose two low-complexity algorithms by exploiting the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM), whose updating step is performed in closed-form solutions. In the first algorithm, both UAV trajectory and transmit power are determined simultaneously. We also propose a second algorithm which iteratively optimizes transmit power and trajectory. The simulation results show that by using the proposed ADMM-based algorithms, one can achieve higher performance than state-of-the-art methods with reduced computation time.",Drone,2019
The Broadcast Storm Problem in FANETs and the Dynamic Neighborhood-Based Algorithm as a Countermeasure,"Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) are a new paradigm that can overcome mission constraints of single unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). FANETs are composed of several UAVs that cooperate to accomplish some critical mission (i.e., hazardous area monitoring). In order to maintain UAVs coordination, all UAVs must continuously retransmit or relay messages through the wireless channel to assure that every UAV knows the FANET condition. However, when this message exchange is done arbitrarily, it may cause the broadcast storm problem, leading the wireless medium to an inoperable state. Despite some efforts reported in the literature for providing general broadcast storm problem mitigation techniques, the challenge of aggregating new information/knowledge to receivers, instead of just spreading the information in the network, has received less attention. In this paper, we not only prove that broadcast storm problem causes network contention as the number of UAVs increases but also propose the innovative dynamic neighborhood-based algorithm for the broadcast storm problem (DNA-BSP), which was developed and validated based on the outdoor experiments and computer simulations. It can mitigate the broadcast storm problem, which is a real challenge in FANETs, reducing message redundancy in more than 98%, and making message delivery more than 95% faster than in flooding scenario, outperforming classical broadcast storm mitigation techniques when applied in FANETs. Our detailed results can also guide future researches and provide useful insights for engineers planning and optimizing mission-critical mobile ad hoc network with the support of UAVs.",Drone,2019
Optimization Design and Application of Active Disturbance Rejection Controller Based on Intelligent Algorithm,"The parameter tuning optimization design is realized for an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) in combination with the improvement of the existing swarm intelligence algorithm. Taking the optimization design and application of ADRC as an example, this paper is focused on investigating the improvement of the hybrid algorithm composed of fish swarm algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm and its application in parameter tuning of ADRC. The main contents are as follows. First, the parameters that need to be tuned are determined based on the composition and principle of the ADRC. The module building technology of S-function is adopted to create the module library of ARDC in terms of the modular construction idea and a complete simulation example of ADRC is built in Simulink. Second, the parameters are improved according to the proposed hybrid algorithm composed of the artificial fish swarm algorithm and the standard particle swarm optimization algorithm, and the control performance is tested by the MATLAB simulation of the ADRC whose parameters are optimized by using the algorithm. Finally, the flight attitude control of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is taken as an application example, and the fixed-wing UAV is selected as the research object. Through the analysis of the experimental results, the effectiveness of the optimized design is verified for the ADRC in the attitude control of the UAV.",Drone,2019
A Study on Development of a Hybrid Aerial/Terrestrial Robot System for Avoiding Ground Obstacles by Flight,"To date, many studies related to robots have been performed around the world. Many of these studies have assumed operation at locations where entry is difficult, such as disaster sites, and have focused on various terrestrial robots, such as snake-like, humanoid, spider-type, and wheeled units. Another area of active research in recent years has been aerial robots with small helicopters for operation indoors and outdoors. However, less research has been performed on robots that operate both on the ground and in the air. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a hybrid aerial/terrestrial robot system. The proposed robot system was developed by equipping a quadcopter with a mechanism for ground movement. It does not use power dedicated to ground movement, and instead uses the flight mechanism of the quadcopter to achieve ground movement as well. Furthermore, we addressed the issue of obstacle avoidance as part of studies on autonomous control. Thus, we found that autonomous control of ground movement and flight was possible for the hybrid aerial/terrestrial robot system, as was autonomous obstacle avoidance by flight when an obstacle appeared during ground movement.",Drone,2019
MTD (Moving Target Detection) with Preposition Hash Table for Security of Drone Network,"As the drones industry evolved, the security of the drone network has been important. In this paper, MTD (Moving Target Detection) technique is applied to the drone network for improving security. The existing MTD scheme has a risk that the hash value is exposed during the wireless communication process, and it is restricted to apply the one-to-many network. Therefore, we proposed PHT (Preposition Hash Table) scheme to prevent exposure of hash values during wireless communication. By reducing the risk of cryptographic key exposure, the use time of the cryptographic key can be extended and the security of the drone network will be improved. In addition, the cryptographic key exchange is not performed during flight, it is advantageous to apply PHT for a swarm drone network. Through simulation, we confirmed that the proposed scheme can contribute to the security of the drone network.",Drone,2019
Transmission Lines Rights-of-Way Mapping Using a Low-cost Drone Photogrammetry,Electric transmission towers are facilities to transport electrical power from a plant to an electrical substation. The towers are connected using wires considering the wire tension and the clearance from the ground or nearby objects. The wires are installed on a rights-of-way that is a strip of land used by electrical utilities to maintain the transmission line facilities. Trees and plants around transmission lines must be managed to keep the operation of these lines safe and reliable. This study proposed the use of a low-cost drone photogrammetry for the transmission line rights-of-way mapping. Aerial photogrammetry is carried out to generate a dense point cloud around the transmission lines from which a DSM (Digital Surface Model) and DTM (Digital Terrain Model) are created. The lines and nearby objects are separated using nDSM (normalized Digital Surface Model) and the noises are suppressed in the multiple image space for the geospatial analysis. The experimental result with drone images over two spans of transmission lines on a mountain area showed that the proposed method successfully generate the rights-of-way map with hazard nearby objects.,Drone,2019
Optimization study on fuel cell cathode oxygen flow path for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle using computational visualization,"Numerical visualization is conducted to confirm the variation of flow characteristics and pressure drop by the shape of channels on the cathode flow path in hydrogen fuel cells for unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). Generally, a light-weight fan is commonly used rather than a heavy air compressor at UAVS. However, in case of blower fan, a large pressure drop in the flow path causes the blocking of the oxygen supply to the fuel cell. Therefore, the uniformity of flow inside the cathode has to be achieved by changing the shape of the cathode. The flow channel, the duct shape, and the diameter of the fan are changed to optimize the flow path. As a result, it is confirmed that the optimal flow path can decrease the velocity difference between the center and outer flow by 1.8%. However, It should be noted that the channel size can increase the pressure drop.",Drone,2019
Design of Multi-Mode Radar Signal Processor for UAV Detection,"Radar systems are divided into the pulse Doppler (PD) radar and the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar depending on the transmission waveform. In particular, the PD radar is advantageous for long-range target detection, and the FMCW radar is suitable for short-range target detection. In this paper, we present design and implementation results for a multi-mode radar signal processor (RSP) that can support both PD and FMCW radar systems to detect unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at short distances as well as long distances. The proposed radar signal processor can be implemented based on Altera Cyclone-IV FPGA with 19,623 logic elements, 9,759 registers, and 25,190,400 memory bits. The logic elements and registers of the proposed radar signal processor are reduced by approximately 43% and 30%, respectively, compared to the sum of logic elements and registers of the conventional PD radar and FMCW radar signal processor.",Drone,2019
Performance Analysis of 6.78MHz Current Mode Class D Power Amplifier According to Load Impedance Variation,"This paper has designed a current mode class D power amplifier to increase the transmission efficiency of a 6.78 MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) transmitter and to ensure stable characteristics even when the transmitting and receiving coil intervals change. By reducing the loss due to the parasitic capacitor component of the transistor, which limits the theoretical efficiency of the linear amplifier, this research has improved the efficiency of the power amplifier. The circuit design simulator was used to design the high efficiency amplifier, and the power output and efficiency characteristics according to the load impedance change have been simulated and verified. In the simulation, 42.1 dBm output and 95% efficiency was designed at DC bias 30 V. The power amplifier was fabricated and showed 91% efficiency at the output of 42.1 dBm (16 W). The transmitting and receiving coils were fabricated for wireless power transfer of the drone, and the maximum power added efficiency was 88% and the output power was 42.1 dBm ¡À 1.7 dB according to the load change causing from the coil intervals.",Drone,2019
Classification of UAV-to-ground vehicles based on micro-Doppler signatures using singular value decomposition and reconstruction,"Classification of ground vehicles from the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is the basis for local precision strikes. In this paper, a method based on micro-Doppler effect which provides unique information of targets is proposed for ground vehicles classification. Firstly, models describing the air-to-ground relationship between ground vehicles and the UAV are built to derive mathematical expressions of radar echo signals. Secondly, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is utilized to analyze micro-Doppler components of the ground wheeled vehicle and the ground tracked vehicle respectively. Thirdly, according to classify requirements, specific signal components are restored by Singular Value Reconstruction (SVR). Seven micro-Doppler features are extracted from reconstructed signals. At last, these features are sent to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Compared with current related methods such as Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and multi-level wavelet decomposition (MWD), experimental results in different cases illustrate the effectiveness of this method. Discrimination performance under various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) also proves the robustness of proposed method.",Drone,2019
Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) and H-2 proton exchange membrane fuel (PEMFC/H-2) cell performance under atmospheric flight conditions of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Recently, there has been growing interest in fuel cell implementation on aircraft, particularly for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) propulsion. The performance of both fuel cell types, cathode air-breathing H-2 Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC/H-2) and passive Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs), is dependent on atmospheric conditions such as pressure, relative humidity and temperature. In this study, models at the single-cell level have been used to simulate the corresponding polarization curves on flight conditions, which constitutes a contribution to the use of fuel cells in UAV. After validating these models, several cases of interest relating to UAV operation have been considered, such as cruise flight at different altitudes and horizontal flight when crossing clouds, to compare the performance of both types of fuel cells. Fuel cell temperature has been controlled to avoid high performance degradation. The results show that the effects of atmospheric flight conditions are more important for PEMFC/H-2 than for DMFCs. Low pressure affects PEMFC/H-2 performance to a greater extent than DMFC performance. Atmospheric relative humidity affects PEMFC/H-2 performance, especially at high cell temperatures, whereas DMFC performance is barely affected. Although performance is lost, it is possible to operate fuel cells in UAV propulsion systems at low-medium altitudes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019

L-1 Adaptive Control of a Dual-Rotor Tail-Sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicle With Input Constraints During Hover Flight,"The input constraints of control surfaces may lead to saturations, which could limit the achievable performance or even cause instability of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To improve flight safety and attitude tracking performance, a novel L-1 adaptive control architecture for attitude tracking of a tail sitter subjected to input constraints is proposed in this study. The imprecise mathematical model, low weight, and small size all present different challenges when designing a control system. In this work, a feedforward compensator is first used to narrow down the uncertain bounds with the consideration of finite accuracy from prior knowledge. Second, according to the linearized model, a baseline controller is designed to offer basic performance for a nominal system without uncertainty. Finally, the L-1 adaptive controller is developed to compensate for unmatched uncertainties based on the control system developed before. The stability and performance bounds of the closed-loop system are analyzed to illustrate the impact of input constraints. The numerical simulations and flight tests are carried out to verify the improved attitude tracking performance when input saturation exists.",Drone,2019

Optimal Energy Management of UAV-Based Cellular Networks Powered by Solar Panels and Batteries: Formulation and Solutions,"We focus on the problem of managing the energy consumption of a cellular network tailored to cover rural and low-income areas. The considered architecture exploits Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to ensure wireless coverage, as well as Solar Panels (SPs) and batteries installed in a set of ground sites, which provides the energy required to recharge the UAVs.

After providing the problem formulation, we face its complexity by proposing a decomposition-based approach and by designing a brand-new genetic algorithm. The results, obtained over a set of representative case studies, reveal that there exists a trade-off between the UAVs battery level, the ground sites battery level, and the level of coverage. In addition, both the decomposed version and the genetic algorithm perform sufficiently close to the integrated model, with a strong improvement in the computation times.",Drone,2019

We propose an efficient way of system operation for UAV control in cooperation of aircraft and UAV, and verify its efficiency via speech recognition experiment.",Drone,2019
Altitude Control for Variable Load Quadrotor via Learning Rate Based Robust Sliding Mode Controller,"This paper aims to solve the problem of altitude control of the variable load quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Generally, the controller parameters of the quadrotor are adjusted for constant load and external disturbance factors. However, whether in military fields or civilian fields, the quadrotor will encounter variable load situations, such as throwing weapons or delivering express. Variable load as a large internal disturbance factor results in control instability. Toward this end, a novel robust sliding mode controller SMC) is designed to track the desired trajectory promptly under variable load condition while restraining the chattering problem. This novel controller consists of learning rate-based sliding mode surface and inverse hyperbolic function-based adaptive sliding mode reaching law. It is worth mentioning that a mass estimation algorithm is added to the proposed novel SMC to estimate the real-time mass of the quadrotor in the air, which improves the quadrotor's performance in restraining the large variable load disturbance impact. In addition, the altitude control law is derived on the basis of the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the simulation and experimental results are carried out to show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controller in terms of altitude tracking, mass estimation, and disturbance resistance.",Drone,2019
Ultrafast Rectifier for Variable-Frequency Application,"In this paper, an ultrafast active rectifier is presented for variable-frequency applications. Three-phase ac-dc converters (rectifiers) are extensively implemented in motor-drives, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and aircraft's power systems. In some technologies, e.g., more electric aircraft and drones, power systems may employ variable-frequency generators for higher efficiency and reliability indices. The proposed ultrafast rectifier is equipped by a step-ahead predictive control scheme, an instantaneous phase-locked loop (PLL), and a module of six SiC MOSFETs. The control scheme regulates the dc voltage and maintains unity power factor with an extremely low total harmonic distortion in the input currents. The instantaneous PLL, applicable only for three-phase systems, is integrated to the proposed variable-frequency control scheme in order to minimize the error in the power factor. The step-ahead predictive scheme and instantaneous PLL combination provides fast and smooth dynamic responses under rapid frequency transients. Experimental results are presented using a laboratory-scale SiC-based MOSEET 115 V-LL/270 V-dc rectifier, and the performance of the proposed controller is compared with a classical power factor correction controller in the presence of frequency ramp and step changes. The experimental results demonstrate a superior dynamic performance of the proposed ultrafast active rectifier.",Drone,2019
Joint Positioning of Flying Base Stations and Association of Users: Evolutionary-Based Approach,"Time-varying requirements of users on communication push mobile operators to increase density of base stations. However, the dense deployment of conventional static base stations (SBSs) is not always economical, for example, when periods of peak load are short and infrequent. In such cases, several flying base stations (FlyBSs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles can be seen as a convenient substitution for the dense deployment of SBSs. This paper focuses on maximization of user satisfaction with provided data rates. To this end, we propose an algorithm that associates users with the most suitable SBS/FlyBS and finds optimal positions of all FlyBSs. Furthermore, we investigate the performance of two proposed approaches for the joint association and positioning based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). It is shown that both solutions improve the satisfaction of users with provided data rates in comparison with a competitive approach. We also demonstrate trade-offs between the GA and the PSO. While the PSO is of lower complexity than the GA, the GA requires a slightly lower number of active FlyBSs to serve the users.",Drone,2019
Sampling Operator to Learn the Scalable Correlation Filter for Visual Tracking,"The correlation filter is suitable for tracking on account of its low computational complexity and promising performance. However, the number of available training samples is limited to the filter size, and the lack of samples leads to poor generalization. Moreover, spectral leakage degrades the filter quality. In this paper, we, therefore, propose a sampling operator for learning a scalable correlation filter in an enlarged window, whose size is larger than the object size. The scalable filter encodes the sparse frequency representation to reconstruct a larger filter with zeros outside of the object in the spatial domain. The sampling operator, which is composed of windowing and sampling operations, enables learning the scalable filter from a large window, and it suppresses spectral leakage. Our method was evaluated on the OTB-100, TC-128, and UAV-123 datasets and achieved the promising results in terms of precision and success rates.",Drone,2019
Analysis and Evaluation of Random Access Transmission for UAV-Assisted Vehicular-to-Infrastructure Communications,"In this paper, we propose a random access protocol for vehicular-to-infrastructure communications. We consider the case where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides assistance to a roadside unit to enhance the system throughput. In a traditional carrier sense multiple access schemes (CSMA), the vehicle senses the channel first and it does not transmit the data until the channel is free. However, the CSMA has been shown to be often wasteful of resources and includes potentially unbounded channel access delays in dense networks. In this paper, we use the capture effect, where collisions can be resolved, provided the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio is larger than a predetermined threshold. Moreover, we show that the access probability of the vehicles can be optimized based on the known density of the network to maximize throughput. Based on the proposed random access protocol, we model the behavior of the vehicles using a two-dimensional Markov chain and derive the expression for the average system throughput. Finally, we propose two transmission power control schemes to further enhance system throughput. We present extensive simulation results to show that the UAV can provide 9%-38% improvement in throughput for variable network densities.",Drone,2019

"A Unified Framework for Software Defined Sensing, Transmission and Computing","The in-cessation trend of railways ramification calls for railway sensing on an urgent basis. Railway sense is required to keep suspecting potential danger in a large scope and provide a safe transportation environment. The fundamental infrastructure to realize railway sensing comprises of space and terrestrial integrated network (STIN) nodes, such as high-speed railway, trackside equipment, unmanned aerial vehicle, airship, and remote sensing satellite. This architecture needs to support diverse applications flexibly and ensure efficient infrastructure management. Inspired by the philosophy of software-defined network, which attempts to give more flexibility to networks, we propose a software-defined sensing and integrated architecture for such a network. We decouple the railway sensing application from the physical infrastructure. Besides, we designed centralized controllers to manage physical facilities and supply APIs of data processing, including acquisition, transmission, computation, and storage.

This paper includes discussions of the design details of the proposed architecture and benefits. We also proposed some open problems and the potential solutions to solve them, which we hope to provide railway sensing research in a new direction.",Drone,2019
Communication-Aware UAV Path Planning,"Autonomous air drones, known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), often accomplish missions with real-time video streaming leveraging the available cellular network. Video streaming is a typical application with stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements, which are not always supported in the whole mission area. In this paper, we address the offline path planning problem of finding the optimal path from a source to a destination in 2-D space in order to maximize the communication quality, given a cellular coverage, and thus providing throughput guarantees to the video streaming In addressing the problem, the restricted amount of available energy, the wind effect, and the path post-smoothing problem are considered. We propose two innovative path planning algorithms and we show that our algorithms outperform classical approaches that are oblivious of communication network coverage. Both algorithms are variants of classical A* algorithm and they optimize the path jointly in terms of distance and of the experienced throughput by the drone: in this way, the quality of the video streaming along the path is optimized while preserving the energy budget for the flight. We describe both of the algorithms and investigate their performance. Moreover, we introduce a novel path smoothing method that outperforms classing approaches in terms of distance and computation cost. Finally, in order to prove that our algorithms can be practically utilized in the real-world path planners, we integrate our proposed path planning algorithms into the popular QGroundControl (QGC) control station.",Drone,2019
Machine-Learning and 3D Point-Cloud Based Signal Power Path Loss Model for the Deployment of Wireless Communication Systems,"Modeling signal power path loss (SPPL) for deployment of wireless communication systems (WCSs) is one of the most time consuming and expensive processes that require data collections during link budget analysis. Radio frequency (RF) engineers mainly employ either deterministic or stochastic approaches for the estimation of SPPL. In the case of stochastic approach, empirical propagation models use predefined estimation parameters for different environments such as reference distance path loss PL(do)(dB), path loss exponent (n), and log-normal shadowing (X-sigma with N(sigma, mu = 0)). Since empirical models broadly classify the environment under urban, suburban, and rural area, they do not take into account every micro-variation on the terrain. Therefore, empirical models deviate significantly from actual measurements. This paper proposes a smart deployment method of WCS to minimize the need for predefined estimation parameters by creating a 3-D deployment environment which takes into account the micro-variations in the environment. Tree canopies are highly complex structures which create micro-variations and related unidentified path loss due to scattering and absorption. Thus, our proposed model will mainly focus on the effect of tree canopies and can be applied to any environment. The proposed model uses a 2-D image color classification to extract features from a 3-D point cloud and a machine learning (ML) algorithm to predict SPPL. Empirical path loss models have received signal level (RSL) errors in the range of 6.29%-16.9% from the actual RSL measurements while the proposed model has an RSL error of 4.26%.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Flight Control for Multi-Rotor UAVs Flying at Low Altitude,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at low altitude flight may significantly degrade their performance and the safety under wind disturbances and incorrect operations. This paper presents a robust control strategy for UAVs to achieve good performance of low altitude flight and disturbance rejection. First, a novel second-order hexacopter dynamics is established and the position tracking is translated to the altitude and the rotational angle tracking problem. An integrated control scheme is created to deal with the challenges faced by hexacopter at low altitude flight, in which the influence of near-ground threshold distance and the desired roll, pitch, and yaw are analyzed. Moreover, an improved flying altitude planner and an attitude planner for low altitude conditions are designed respectively to avoid the overturning risk due to the big reaction torque and external disturbances. Second, a sliding-mode-based altitude tracking controller and an attitude tracking controller are designed to reduce the tracking errors and improve the robustness of the system. Finally, the proposed control scheme is tested on simulation and experiment platforms of multi-rotor UAV to show the feasibility and accurate trajectory tracking at low altitude flight.",Drone,2019
Distributed Conflict-Detection and Resolution Algorithms for Multiple UAVs Based on Key-Node Selection and Strategy Coordination,"A distributed conflict-detection (CD) and resolution algorithm for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles based on key-node selection and strategy coordination are proposed in this paper. Each aircraft is regarded as a critical node in a complex network. A novel temporal and spatial integrated CD methodology is proposed for aircraft formations and clusters. Each node selects three candidate strategies from a pre-set pool of strategies and generates corresponding planned tracks using uncertainty modeling based on the 6 degrees-of-freedom motion. The primary combination of strategies required for coordination of the aircraft in conflict is based on the maximum-robustness principle. To address partial knowledge of the environment, a special token-allocation strategy for coordination with incomplete information is proposed in this paper. To address potential data dropouts, this study damps the solution to achieve coordination. Two extreme scenarios are constructed to examine the proposed methodology. The results showed great collision-avoidance ability in continuous conflicts with multiple aircraft in a highly dynamic 3-D environment.",Drone,2019
Correction of Barrel Distortion in Fisheye Lens Images Using Image-Based Estimation of Distortion Parameters,"Images acquired by a fisheye lens camera contain geometric distortion that results in deformation of the object's shape. To correct the lens distortion, existing methods use prior information, such as calibration patterns or lens design specifications. However, the use of a calibration pattern works only when an input scene is a 2-D plane at a prespecified position. On the other hand, the lens design specifications can be understood only by optical experts. To solve these problems, we present a novel image-based algorithm that corrects the geometric distortion. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: i) feature detection, ii) distortion parameter estimation, and iii) selection of the optimally corrected image out of multiple corrected candidates. The proposed method can automatically select the optimal amount of correction for a fisheye lens distortion by analyzing characteristics of the distorted image using neither prespecified lens design parameters nor calibration patterns. Furthermore, our method performs not only on-line correction by using facial landmark points, but also off-line correction described in subsection III-C. As a result, the proposed method can be applied to a virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) camera with two fisheye lenses in a field-of-view (FOV) of 195 degrees, autonomous vehicle vision systems, wide-area visual surveillance systems, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cameras.",Drone,2019
UNMANNED AIR VEHICLE 3-D WING AERODYNAMICAL DESIGN AND ALGORITHM STABILITY WITH RESPECT TO INITIAL SHAPE,"A new technology of the optimal design of aerodynamic configurations based on a new generation software product is used for aerodynamic design of a 3-D wing of the middle class unmanned aerial vehicle. The optimal shape of the wing, which is characterized by minimum total drag at a fixed lift coefficient and corresponding to the specified geometric and aerodynamic constraints, is determined on the basis of the global search method and numerical solutions of the complete Navier-Stokes equations. It is shown that the proposed approach provides reduction in a wing drag in the cruise flight zone and significantly reduces the material and time costs for aerodynamic aircraft design. Optimal wing has a significantly lower drag at the main design point, and it can be used during cruising and in its vicinity. Optimization allows improving of the glider wing quality. Optimal wing is distinguished by better aerodynamic characteristics in the wide vicinity of design point in terms of the Mach numbers and lift coefficient. Such wing is resistant to the small changes in the flight conditions and it meets all given geometric and aerodynamic constraints.",Drone,2019
Energy- and Latency-Aware Hybrid Offloading Algorithm for UAVs,"One of the most promising use cases of 5G/IMT2020 is the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Due to their small size, the UAVs are resource constraint devices. To this end, this paper proposes an offloading algorithm for UAVs to assist in the execution of computationally intensive tasks. The proposed algorithm provides two UAV offling methods. The fit offlding method is the air-offloading, where a UAV can offload its computing tasks to nearby UAVs that have available computing and energy resources. The second offloading method is the ground-offlding, which enables the offloading of tasks to an edge cloud server from the multi-level edge cloud units connected to ground stations. The proposed algorithm is energy-and latency-aware, i.e., it selects the execution device and the offlding method based on the latency and energy constraints. The intensive algorithm simulation over reliable conditions for various scenarios with different cases for each scenario is conducted and results are presented.",Drone,2019
Autonomous Moving Target-Tracking for a UAV Quadcopter Based on Fuzzy-PI,"Moving target-tracking is an attractive application for quadcopters and a very challenging, complicated field of research due to the complex dynamics of a quadcopter and the varying speed of the moving target with time. For this reason, various control algorithms have been developed to track a moving target using a camera. In this paper, a Fuzzy-PI controller is developed to adjust the parameters of the PI controller using the position and change of position data as input. The proposed controller is compared to a gain-scheduled PID controller instead of the typical PID controller. To verify the performance of the developed system and distinguish which one has better performance, several experiments of a quadcopter tracking a moving target are conducted under the varying speed of the moving target, indoor and outdoor and during day and night. The obtained results indicate that the proposed controller works well for tracking a moving target under different scenarios, especially during night.",Drone,2019

The UAV flight path is optimized to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the required parameters are estimated. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve performance close to an ideal SINR optimization and also highlight the benefits of optimizing the SINR instead of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when a jamming or interference signal is present.",Drone,2019
Intermittent Gliding Flight Control Design and Verification of a Morphing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"The intermittent gliding flight method takes advantage of the updraft is adopted to increase the flight endurance time of a type of multifunctional morphing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This type of UAV is able to be folded before launch, launch from a cylindrical launch tube, and adjust the wing span and sweep angle during flight. It has the advantages of convenient storage and transportation and can use the energy of the updraft. In order to effectively utilize the updraft, the mathematical model of updraft is established, and an updraft judging method is proposed. In order to complete the intermittent gliding flight, the flight progress is divided into two stages and a segmentation control law is proposed. During the intermittent gliding stage switching, the wing sweep angle and wing span length are varied to accommodate requirements of different stages. H-infinity robust control design method for gain scheduling based on linear parameter varying model is used to ensure the stability of the morphing UAV during the wings change. The mathematical simulation verifies the effectiveness of the morphing control algorithm. After that, a semi-physical simulation verification involving a mathematical UAV model with a physical wing changing mechanism, a physical embedded flight control module, the real flight attitude, and the virtual route are implemented. It has been verified that the morphing UAV can remain stable throughout the entire cycle of the intermittent gliding. Moreover, the intermittent gliding flight with updraft can reduce the fuel consumption of the morphing UAV and increase its flight endurance time.",Drone,2019

By establishing a task sequence, each UAV strictly separates the necessary task time and synchronization waiting time. For the found new targets, each UAV quickly determines its available time period. According to the available time and task resources, an auction algorithm and consensus algorithm are used to decompose the task assignment into initial distributed assignment phase and swarm consensus phase to develop real-time conflict-free task solutions for UAV swarm. The simulation experiment verified that the algorithm could assign different tasks to UAVs in a real-time distributed manner with the limited resources of each UAV.",Drone,2019
Adaptation and Validation of the Korean Version of the Urticaria Control Test and Its Correlation With Salivary Cortisone,"Purpose: Frequent changes in chronic urticaria (CU) activity over time can cause psychological stress, which also serves as a trigger of CU. To measure the control status of CU, the Urticaria Control Test (UCT) was developed in Germany. This study aimed to investigate the validity, reliability and responsiveness to changes in CU for the Korean version of the UCT (K-UCT) and its relation with salivary cortisol and cortisone levels.Methods: Linguistic adaptation of the UCT into Korean was conducted. A total of 96 CU patients were enrolled, and 80 of them completed the study. The K-UCT and other outcome scores for CU were measured and repeated after 4 weeks of treatment. Control status was classified by physicians into well-controlled, partly-controlled, and uncontrolled CU. Salivary cortisol and cortisone were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.Results: Excellent internal consistency and intra-class reliability were obtained. Strong correlations between the K-UCT and disease severity, reflected in the Urticaria Activity Score (UAS)/global assessment of urticaria control by physicians/patient assessment of symptom severity/CU-specific quality of life were noted. K-UCT scores >= 12 were found to be optimal for determining well-controlled CU (sensitivity, 75.0%; specificity, 758%; area under the curve, 0.824). Perceived stress scale scores were significantly correlated with the UAS and the K-UCT. Salivary cortisone levels were significantly correlated with K-UCT (r = 0.308, P = 0.009) and differed significantly according to control status determined by a K-UCT 212.conclusions: This study demonstrated that the K-UCT can be a valid instrument with which to gauge CU control status in Korean patients. Further studies are needed to validate salivary cortisone as a biomarker for CU control.",Drone,2019
Physical Layer Security in Millimeter Wave SWIPT UAV-Based Relay Networks,"Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication is the rising technology for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based relay networks for the abundant bandwidth and short wavelength. However, the secrecy performance of mmWave SWIPT UAV-based relay systems has not been investigated so far. In this paper, we consider secure transmissions of mmWave SWIPT UAV-based relay systems in the presence of multiple independent homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP) eavesdroppers. Different from most existing works considering a free-space path loss model, the air-to-ground channels are modeled as Nakagami-m small-scale fading, and the effects of blockage to mmWave links on the ground and the 3D antenna gain model are considered. The closed-form expressions of the average achievable secrecy rate and energy coverage probability for amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relay protocols under power splitting (PS) SWIPT policy are derived to reveal the impact of various parameters on system performance. The simulation results show that there is the optimal UAV position to maximize the secrecy rate and the optimal position is closer to the node whose transmit power is relatively small. Furthermore, different carrier frequencies are suitable for different eavesdropping node density.",Drone,2019

Generating an Autonomous Landing Testbed of Simulated UAV applied by GA,"In case of unmanned aerial vehicles used in modern society, there has been a problem where a human operator should be still needed to control the UAV because of a lower level of autonomy. In this paper, genetic algorithm is selected as a methodology for the autonomy accomplishment and then we verify a possibility of UAV autonomy by applying the GA. The landing is one of the important classical tasks on aerial vehicle and the lunar Landing is one of the most historical events. Autonomy possibility of computer-simulated UAV is verified by landing autonomy method of a falling body equipped with a propulsion system similar to the lunar Lander. When applying the GA, the genom is encoded only with 4 actions (left-turn, right-turn, thrust, and free-fall) and applied onto the falling body, Then we applied the major operations of GA and achieved a success experiment. A major contribution is to construct a simulated UAV where an autonomy of UAV can be accomplished while minimizing the sensor dependency. Also we implemented a test-bed where the possibility of autonomy accomplishment by applying the GA can be verified.",Drone,2019
Arrangement Methods of Cadastral Non-coincidence Oriented Present Condition Using UAV,"This study utilized UAV orthophotos and overlay analysis of cadastral maps to analyze the class of cadastral non-coincidence, and tries to suggest arrangement methods based on the present conditions. For this, UAV orthophotos were produced and ground control points(GCP) and test points were used to verify its accuracy. Results of RMSE showed X=0.032m, Y=0.024m and connection error=0.039m, verifying its applicability. Overlay analysis of the orthophotos and the cadastral maps showed that 64 parcels out of a total of 123 were cadastral non-coincidences, showing biased non-coincidences, position error non-coincidences and irregular non-coincidences. The reduction rate of cadastral non-coincidences were analyzed by dividing the cadastral maps into blocks and methodically moving them while referring to the current present condition layout and the UAV photos. The results showed that 52 non-coincidences that were moved were reduced down to 29 parcels, while biased non-coincidences showed an especially high effective result from maintenance. Thus, an increase in business efficiency may be anticipated by connecting methods of this study with cadastral resurvey projects.",Drone,2019
Direction of Operation of ROKA RPA for Future Warfare,"Unmanned systems will become a necessity, not an option, for future warfare. Especially as the core of unmanned systems, unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) will continue to expand their scope of operations. However, recognizing UAV as fully autonomous raises several problems.

Secure Multi-UAV Collaborative Task Allocation,"Unmanned aerial vehicle technology has made great progress in the past and is widely used in many fields. However, they are unable to meet large-scale and complex missions with a limited energy reserve. Only multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (multi-UAV) work together to better cope with this problem and have been extensively studied. In this paper, a new systematic framework is proposed to solve the problem of multi-UAVcollaborative task allocation. It is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved by the improved clustering algorithm. The purpose is to enable multi-UAV to complete tasks with lower energy consumption. As the number of UAVs rises, it also appears the flight safety issues such as collisions among the UAVs, an improved multi-UAV collision-resistant method based on the improved artificial potential field is proposed. Besides, the UAVs connected with the internet are vulnerable to the various type of network attacks, a method based on the intrusion detection system is proposed to resist the network attack during multi-UAV mission execution. We have also proposed an improved method to improve the accuracy of task allocation further. In addition, an online real-time path planning is proposed to enhance the robustness of multi-UAV to cope with sudden problems. Finally, the numerical simulations and real physical flying experiments showed that the proposed method could provide a viable solution for multi-UAV task allocation; moreover, compared with other task allocation methods, our method has great performance.",Drone,2019

Adaptive finite-time reconfiguration control of unmanned aerial vehicles with a moving leader,"This paper investigates adaptive reconfiguration control problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) helicopter system with a moving leader. Only part of UAV helicopter is informed to have access to the leader's position. The six degree-of-freedom UAV system is composed of position outer loop and attitude inner loop. In this paper, we introduce a new fully distributed, finite-time reconfiguration controller and the problem of inter-UAVs collision avoidance was solved using potential energy function approach, extending the asymptotical formation controller without collision avoidance from the literature. The distinctive feature of our algorithm from existing works is that the novel formation reconfiguration controller can achieve finite-time, collision avoidance and fully distributed formation only based on relative positions between UAV and its adjacents. It means that the control algorithm is independent of any global information that requires to be calculated by each follower UAV. The system uncertainties are estimated by radial basis function neural network in practical finite time. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the efficiency of the designed strategy.",Drone,2019
Fractional-order sliding mode control of uncertain QUAVs with time-varying state constraints,"In this paper, a novel robust fractional-order sliding mode (FOSM)-based state constrained control scheme is designed for uncertain quadrotor UAVs (QUAVs). Model uncertainties and wind gust disturbances are taken into consideration. Under the presented framework, the overall QUAV system is decoupled into translational subsystem and rotational subsystem. These two subsystems are connected to each other through common attitude extraction algorithms. For translational subsystem, the robust state variables constrained controller is designed to ensure the position state variables within the given time-varying constraints. For the rotational subsystem, a new robust FOSM controller is constructed to track the desired attitudes with better performances. Finally, the system is proved to be asymptotically stable, and both simulation and experiment results are conducted to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.",Drone,2019
Trajectory planning for autonomous underwater vehicles in the presence of obstacles and a nonlinear flow field using mixed integer nonlinear programming,"This paper addresses the time-optimal trajectory planning for autonomous underwater vehicles. A detailed mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is presented, explicitly taking into account vehicle kinematic constraints, obstacle avoidance, and a nonlinear flow field to represent the ocean current. MINLP problems pose great challenges because of the combinatorial complexity and nonconvexities introduced by the nature of the flow field. A novel solution approach in an optimization framework is developed to address associated difficulties. The main benefit of the proposed methodology is the ability to find multiple local minima. The contribution of the paper is fourfold: (1) a novel approach to integrate the flow field into the MINLP model; (2) a diversified initialization strategy using multiple waypoints, different solvers and approximated models, namely, a mixed integer linear programming model and the MINLP model with and without the flow field; (3) an algorithm that forces the solver to seek improved solutions; and (4) a parallel computing approach capitalizing on diversified initialization. The performance of the resulting methodology is illustrated on idealized case studies, and the results are used to gain insight into trajectory planning in the presence of flow fields.

BICSF: Bio-inspired Clustering Scheme for FANETs,"Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) have dynamic topology because of the mobile unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The limited battery resource and mobility of UAVs cause unstable routing in the FANET. In this paper, we try to minimize this issue with the help of an efficient clustering scheme. We propose a bio-inspired clustering scheme for FANETs (BICSF), which uses the hybrid mechanism of glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) and hill herd (KH). The proposed scheme uses energy aware cluster formation and cluster head election on the basis of the GSO algorithm. Furthermore, we propose an efficient cluster management algorithm using the behavioral study of KH. We also use genetic operators such as mutation and crossover for the optimal position of the UAV.

Mission-Based Energy Consumption Prediction of Multirotor UAV,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is lately one of many popular research topics. High variety of its usage makes it attentive to be studied on its construction or the control. However, without knowing the energy that will be consumed in each mission, the available flight duration will be unknown and the usages of this vehicle will be limited. A mission-based black box modeling of UAV's energy consumption prediction was proposed in this paper. The setup consists of ArduPilot with Mission Planner Firmware installed to a custom built hexarotor. The method consists of three consecutive steps: data collection, data preprocessing, and regression. To collect the required data, flight patterns that contained several types of movements were defined, where the flight data log that contained missions, GPS, and battery, was collected. The preprocessing included the movement separation and also included the acceleration and the deceleration of horizontal movement. Finally, the regression was done using the Elastic Net Regression from Sklearn. The model was then tested on two flight patterns to simulate a surveillance application of a UAV and could predict with 98.773% mean of energy accuracy of the missions that started from the takeoff and ended with the return to launch command.",Drone,2019
Predictive Formal Analysis of Resilience in Cyber-Physical Systems,"The behavioral analysis of cyber-physical systems in safety-critical scenarios is a challenging task. In this paper, the endogenous and exogenous aspects of resilience are of cornerstone importance in system design and verification. Endogenous resilience is the inherent ability of the system to detect and process internal faults and malicious attacks. Exogenous resilience is the permanent capability of the system to maintain a safe operation within its ambient environment. In this paper, we present a predictive dual-sided contract-based formal methodology to address both aspects of resilience on top of a distributed object-oriented component-based software model. It is illustrated by a case study of urban drone rescue systems. We exploit the formalism of timed automata and the toolbox UPPAAL to predict by abstraction and analyze (simulate and verify) endogenous resilience. Instead of presenting the final models of the case study, we reflect our experience with UPPAAL in generic patterns of system design and contract specification, reusable in other contexts with adaptations. The analysis of exogenous resilience is specific to the considered drone rescue system. It consists of synthesizing by iterative model-checking safe fiight paths for the drones within a 3D virtual model of urban surroundings true to modern cities.",Drone,2019
Energy Efficiency Beamforming Design for UAV Communications With Broadband Hybrid Polarization Antenna Arrays,"Stringent physical resource constraints in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications bring new challenges to energy efficient transmission. In this paper, we study energy efficient beamforming for UAV communications, where a wideband hybrid polarized antenna array with tapped-delay-lines (TDLs) structure is deployed on the UAV. By exploiting hybrid structured, TDLs, and polarized antenna arrays, the strict requirements of hardware size and cost on UAV can be satisfied. It is shown that the energy efficient beamforming with the adopted array can be formulated as a WMMSE-based parameter optimization problem, which however is still a challenging nonconvex problem due to unit modulus constraints in analog beamformer. To overcome the nonconvex nature, an iterative algorithm is proposed, in which the optimization problem is iteratively solved through three convex quadratic programming problems with convex equality or inequality constraints. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed wideband beamforming algorithm can significantly improve the energy efficiency, compared with the gradient projection algorithm.",Drone,2019

Multirotor UAV sensor fusion for precision landing,"Purpose - In relation to rapid development of possible applications of unmanned vehicles, new opportunities for their use are emerging. Among the most dynamic, we can distinguish package shipments, rescue and military applications, autonomous flights and unattended transportation. However, most of the UAV solutions have limitations related to their power supplies and the field of operation. Some of these restrictions can be overcome by implementing the cooperation between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). The purpose of this paper is to explore the problem of sensor fusion for autonomous landing of a UAV on the UGV by comparing the performance of precision landing algorithms using different sensor fusions to have precise and reliable information about the position and velocity.Design/methodology/approach - The difficulties in this scenario, among others, are different coordination systems and necessity for sensor data from air and ground.

Unfortunately, the position measurements obtained from cheap receivers are encumbered with errors when desiring precision. The different approaches are based on the usage of sensor fusion of Inertial Navigation System and image processing. However most of these systems are very vulnerable to lightning.Findings - In this paper, methods based on an exchange of telemetry data and sensor fusion of GNSS, infrared markers detection and others are used. Different methods are compared.Originality/value - The subject of sensor fusion and high-precision measurements in reference to the autonomous vehicle cooperation is very important because of the increasing popularity of these vehicles.

Also, the model will be used to design algorithms to estimate the attitude of an object.Design/methodology/approach - The physical model of UAV assumes that it is a rigid body with six degrees of freedom acted by forces generated by the propellers, motors, aerodynamic forces, gravity and disturbance forces. The mathematical model was described by differential equations. However, drive system (propeller, BLDC motor and BLDC motor controller) was described by six transfer functions. These transfer functions were demarcated with Matlab/Simulink identification toolbox from data received from a specially designed laboratory stand. Moments of inertia of the platform have been analytically determined and compared with empirical results from the pendulum. The mathematical model was implemented in Matlab/Simulink.Findings - The paper confirms the need of designing mathematical models. Moreover, mathematical models show that some parts of the object are better to be replaced by experimental results than by equations, which is proved by the data. The paper also shows advantages of using Matlab/Simulink. What is more the simulation of the model proves that multirotor is an unstable object.Research limitations/implications - The test results show that drive units are strongly dependent on ambient conditions. An additional problem is the different response of the drive set to increasing and decreasing the control signal amplitude. Next tests will be done at different temperatures and air densities of the environment, also it is need to explore drag forces.Practical implications - The mathematical model is a simplification of the physical model expressed by means of equations. The results of simulation like accelerations and angular rate are noise-free. However, available sensors always have their errors and noise. To design control loops and attitude estimation algorithms, there is a need for identification of sensors' errors and noise. These parameters have to be measured.Originality/value - The paper describes a solution of correct identification of drive unit, which is a main component of the UAV.",Drone,2019
Research and selection of MALE wing profile,"Purpose - The purpose of this research is a preliminary selection of wing section, which would be the best suited for PW-100 - a MALE class UAV of 600 kg weight. PW-100 will be used as a testing platform in different institutions such as research institutes, industry research centers or universities of technology (phase 1) to enable the in-flight testing of various on-board systems (mobile radars, thermovision sensors, chemical sensors, antennas, teledetection systems and others). Untypical layout of PW-100 resulted from the plans of further development of this configuration for a military application.Design/methodology/approach - Important role in the research described in this paper plays the selection of main wing section to fulfil the preliminary requirements regarding maximum lift coefficient, minimum drag, aerodynamic efficiency etc. Two different wing sections (R1082 and SA19) were tested in wind tunnel, both with flaps deflected at the range of 0 degrees-30 degrees. Experimental measurements were performed in the low turbulence wind tunnel with closed test section of 45 cm x 35 cm. Numerical simulations of the flow around the wing sections were performed using MSES code. Boundary conditions were assumed basing on the typical mission of PW-100 for flight altitude around 9,000 m, speed of 110 km/h what results in Re = 956,000.Findings - Lift coefficients obtained from both experimental and numerical methods for single slatted airfoil SA19 are much higher than that of get for Ronch R1082 airfoil. PW-100 aircraft with SA19 airfoils will be able to be trimmed and fly at any altitude up to 9,000 m and with an arbitrary weight up to 600 kg. Aerodynamic characteristics of SA19 remain smoother and more predictable than that of R1082 airfoil. The very promising properties of SA19 airfoil are well known to the authors since the beginning of last decade when PW team worked together with IAI team on CAPECON project and now it was fully confirmed by this research.Practical implications - It was confirmed that selection of the proper wing section for the special mission performed by UAV is of the highest importance decision to be taken at the preliminary design phase. Because there is a limited access to the base of technical parameters in many different UAVs classes and the classical analysis of trends cannot be fully applied, the wing section analysis, either experimental or numerical, must be performed. The situation is much worse than in the case of manned aircrafts because most of the modern UAVs are made of carbon or glass fiber, and therefore, there is no chance for analysis of trends.Originality/value - This paper presents a very efficient method of assessing the influence of wing section on aircraft performance adopted for MALE class UAV, especially in an early stage of preliminary design process. The assessment is built mainly on three requirements: Maximum 2D lift coefficient for take-off configuration with flap deflected on 20 degrees should be greater than 2.4. Endurance factor CL1.5/CD for loitering conditions (Ma = 0.5 and CD0 = 0.008) should be greater than 110. The relative wing section thickness should be greater/equal than 19 per cent (it is required for high volume fuel tank located in the wings).",Drone,2019
Propulsion model for (hybrid) unmanned aircraft systems (UAS),"Purpose - This paper deals with the estimation of the necessary masses of propulsion components for multirotor UAS. Originally, within the design process of multirotors, this is an iterative problem, as the propulsion masses contribute to the total takeoff mass. Hence, they influence themselves and cannot be directly calculated. The paper aims to estimate the needed propulsion masses with respect to the requested thrust because of payload, airframe weight and drag forces and with respect to the requested flight time.Design/methodology/approach - Analogue to the well-established design synthesis of airplanes, statistical data of existing electrical motors, propellers and rechargeable batteries are evaluated and analyzed. Applying Rankine and Froude's momentum theory and a generic model for electro motor efficiency factors on the statistical performance data provides correlations between requested performance and, therefore, needed propulsion masses. These correlations are evaluated and analyzed in the scope of buoyant-vertical-thrusted hybrid UAS.Findings - This paper provides a generic mathematical propulsion model. For given payloads, airframe structure weights and a requested flight time, appropriate motor, propeller and battery masses can be modelled that will provide appropriate thrust to lift payload, airframe and the propulsion unit itself over a requested flight time.Research limitations/implications - The model takes into account a number of motors of four and is valid for the category of nano and small UAS.Practical implications - The presented propulsion model enables a full numerical design process for vertical thrusted UAS. Hence, it is the precondition for design optimization and more efficient UAS.Originality/value - The propulsion model is unique and it is valid for pure multirotor as well as for hybrid UAS too.",Drone,2019
Learning-Based User Association for Dual-UAV Enabled Wireless Networks With D2D Connections,"When the communication infrastructures are damaged in disasters, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be utilized as aerial base stations to achieve rapid service recovery. However, the wireless coverage of a single UAV is limited, and device-to-device (D2D) transmission can be exploited to accommodate more users with wireless service. Thus, in this paper, we consider the user association for a dual-UAV-enabled wireless network with the help of D2D connections in disasters. To achieve better performance, we maximize the weighted sum rate of the UAV-served users and the total number of D2D-connected users by optimizing the user association. The formulated problem is a combinatorial optimization problem involving binary variables, which is extremely difficult to solve. Accordingly, we propose two algorithms to solve it approximatively. The first algorithm is the learning-based clustering algorithm by viewing the optimization as a clustering problem. The users who can be served by the UAVs are regarded as cluster centers, which need to be selected optimally. In the second one, the binary variables are relaxed into continuous variables, and then, the problem can be solved by the existing optimization tools. The simulation results demonstrate that these two algorithms can achieve excellent suboptimal performance, and the computational complexity of the learning-based clustering algorithm is much lower.",Drone,2019
Reconfigurable Microstrip Magnetic Dipole Antenna With Switchable Conical Beams for Aerial Drone Applications,"A novel reconfigurable microstrip magnetic dipole antenna with switchable conical beams is proposed for aerial drone applications. The proposed antenna consists of three sub-cavities that are separated by two groups of shorting posts. To reconfigure the resonant cavities, a number of p-i-n diodes are connected to the shorting posts and are used as RF switches. The antenna is capable of resonating in three different operating states. The theoretical analysis shows that the three resonant modes produce conical beams with different elevation angles. The reconfigurable microstrip magnetic dipole antenna yields an overlapping bandwidth from 2.39 to 2.49 GHz for WLAN 2.4-GHz application and produces switchable conical beams for different operating states. The peak gain is 3.9, 4.0, and 4.3 dBi, respectively, when the elevation angle is 90 degrees, 66 degrees, and 54 degrees. The conical beams have omnidirectional radiation patterns in the azimuth plane for the elevation angles. The proposed antenna shows promise for improving the transmission of aerial drones operating at varying altitudes.",Drone,2019
Versatile Conical Conformal Array Antenna Based on Implementation of Independent and Endfire Radiation for UAV Applications,"This paper proposed an integrated conical conformal array antenna (CCAA) for versatile application to the unmanned aerial vehicles. The CCAA consists of five flexible linear gradient subarrays with a uniform circumferential arrangement around the conical surface. It is also embedded with a pyramid reflective back-cavity (PRBC) within the conical carrier. The implementation for the three different elements of the linear gradient subarray toward impedance match and high isolation was investigated, and their identity resonant frequency (9.8 GHz) principle was developed and demonstrated. Furthermore, the PRBC was presented to improve the radiation null of the elements. A numerical 5-bit phase shifter manipulating phase difference of 72 degrees was then combined with an 8-way power divider to obtain a fixed beam with a half power bandwidth (HPBW) of less than 24 degrees, which indicated the backward endfire direction (theta = 180 degrees) in terms of three circumferential arrays (R#X). Finally, the measurements with the aid of the designed phase shifter and power divider (model SHPDW4-040140S) were conducted. The experimental results show one omnidirectional coverage (360 degrees) in the H-plane through the switching working mode of the elements with a wide scanning solid angle (>= 72 degrees) when these elements of the subarray hold an identity resonant frequency and exhibit a uniform performance in the point-to-point communication. The measurements of a narrow HPBW of less than 27.5 degrees and the gain over 10.7 dBi in the endfire direction of the three circumferential arrays show great potential in backward blind space detection simultaneously.",Drone,2019
Adaptive Backstepping Sliding Mode Control of Coaxial Octorotora Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"In this paper, an adaptive backstepping scheme based on sliding mode control method is presented for attitude and altitude tracking control of a coaxial octorotor. The dynamical model of the coaxial octorotor is presented and according to design nature of the control scheme, the dynamical model is divided into three cascaded units: 1) under-actuated unit; 2) fully actuated unit; and 3) rotors thrust force unit. Adaptive backstepping control is then designed for all three units by means of a recursive process using sliding surfaces. The proposed scheme not only stabilizes the given system but also tracks the desired trajectory without any significant tracking error. The stability analysis of the complete system is presented using a Lyapunov stability theory. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller and also show that the proposed controller manages to attain good tracking performance with stabilization of octorotor.",Drone,2019
Capacity of UAV Relaying Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), benefit by low cost, fast deployment, and large coverage, are widely applied as aerial relays in providing communication services for the areas with heavy traffic load or disasters. In this paper, the capacity of UAV relaying networks is studied, where the UAVs act as relays for the ground users. Two scenarios of UAVs distributed on an aerial 2-D plane and in a 3-D space are studied. The analysis reveals that in order to control the air-to-ground interference, the altitude of UAVs is at most in the same order to the distance between two adjacent UAVs. Besides, it is discovered that the pathloss exponent value alpha = 2.5 is a watershed for the capacity of UAV relaying networks, i.e., when alpha <= 2.5, the capacity of UAV relaying networks with the 2-D deployment of UAVs is greater than that with the 3-D deployment of UAVs. Otherwise, the capacity of UAV relaying networks with the 3-D deployment of UAVs is larger than that with the 2-D deployment of UAVs. Furthermore, the mobility of UAVs is studied, and it is verified that the mobility can orderly improve the capacity of UAV relaying networks. The theoretical analysis of this paper provides a guideline for the deployment of UAVs as aerial relays.",Drone,2019
Resource Allocation for Secure UAV-Assisted SWIPT Systems,"The application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is promising to improve the energy harvesting (EH) efficiency of simultaneous wireless and information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. However, the secure communications are challenging in UAV-assisted SWIPT systems due to the high probability of the existence of line-of-sight links between the UAV and eavesdroppers and the broadcast nature of SWIPT. In order to overcome it, a resource allocation problem is studied in an UAV-assisted SWIPT system, where the multiple eavesdroppers exist. The secrecy rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the trajectory and transmit power of the UAV. An alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle the challenging non-convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed resource allocation scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes in terms of the average secrecy rate. It is shown that our proposed algorithm is efficient to converge.",Drone,2019
Operational Effectiveness Evaluation of the Swarming UAVs Combat System Based on a System Dynamics Model,"Currently, the new operational tactic of the swarming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combat is becoming a hotspot in military research, and evaluating the combat efficiency and the roles of UAVs is of vital importance for the future development of UAVs. However, most of the recent studies on the swarming UAVs combat are merely qualitative analyses. This paper proposes an operational effectiveness evaluation method of the swarming UAVs combat system based on a system dynamics (SD) model. The weapons in the combat process are divided into nine subsystems and we build corresponding nine in-trees models using the rate-variable in-trees modeling method. The final SD model is established based on the nine in-trees and the characteristics of swarming UAVs are considered. Taking the surviving rate of UAVs and task completion degree as the evaluation indicators, the model simulation shows that over 50% of the enemy ground targets can be destroyed in 15-time units, although some UAVs may be damaged. It is also confirmed through comparison experiments with other combat patterns that the swarming UAVs play a crucial role in improving the system combat efficiency and can decompose the function of traditional high-value weapon platforms.",Drone,2019
Panoramic UAV Surveillance and Recycling System Based on Structure-Free Camera Array,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have rapidly developed, but the illegal use of UAVs by civilians has resulted in disorder and security risks and has increasingly triggered the community concern and worry. Therefore, the monitoring and recycling of UAVs in key regions are of great significance. This paper presents novel panoramic UAV surveillance and autonomous recycling system that is based on the unique structure-free fisheye camera array and has the capability of real-time UAV detection, 3D localization, tracking, and recycling capacity over a very wide field of view. The main characteristics of this paper include the following: 1) constructing a structure-free camera-array-based panoramic UAV surveillance and recycling system; 2) designing a robust dynamic near-infrared laser-source-based self-calibration algorithm for large-scale arbitrary layout of the camera array; and 3) presenting a set of UAV detection, 3D localization, tracking, and autonomous recycling algorithms based on a fish-eye camera array. The system has been tested in various challenging scenarios, including multiple UAVs with significant appearance and scale changes and even poor weather conditions. The extensive experimental results analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the analysis of the time performance demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed system. In addition, we successfully conduct a recycling and landing experiment with the Parrot Beobop.",Drone,2019
Three-Dimensional Non-Stationary Wideband Geometry-Based UAV Channel Model for A2G Communication Environments,"In this paper, we propose a novel three-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output channel model to describe the air-to-ground (A2G) communication environments. The model introduces the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transmitter and ground mobile receiver (MR) located at the foci points of the boundary ellipsoid, while different ellipsoids represent the propagation properties for different time delays. In light of this, we are able to investigate the propagation properties of the A2G channel model for different time delays. Furthermore, the time-varying parameters of the azimuth angle of departure, the elevation angle of departure, the azimuth angle of arrival, and elevation angle of arrival are derived to properly describe the channel non-stationarity, which is caused by the motion of the UAV transmitter, cluster, and MR. The impacts of the movement properties of the cluster in both the azimuth and elevation planes are investigated on the channel characteristics, i.e., spatial cross-correlation functions, temporal autocorrelation functions, Doppler power spectrum density, and power delay profiles.",Drone,2019
Supplementary Reinforcement Learning Controller Designed for Quadrotor UAVs,"The control problem for quadrotor UAVs is difficult and challenging due to the complex nonlinear dynamics and ever-changing disturbances. In this paper, a supplementary controller based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed to improve the control performance of quadrotor UAVs. The proposed RL method is constructed by an actor-critic structure and some improved technologies, e.g., Q-learning, temporal difference, and experience replay. With the proposed method, the speed and stability of training can be improved greatly. On one hand, the supplementary controller can work together with the traditional controller online, which can guarantee the stability of the system. On the other hand, the model uncertainties and external disturbances could be restrained through online RL training. The Lyapunov theory is used to prove the convergence of the RL controller's weights theoretically. Finally, three simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.",Drone,2019
Joint 3D Beamforming and Trajectory Design for UAV-Enabled Mobile Relaying System,"The goal of this paper is to investigate the security performance of the multi-antenna unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled mobile relaying system with a multi-antenna destination in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper. To improve the secrecy outage probability performance, we propose a location-based three dimensional (3D) beamforming scheme without the channel state information of the destination and the eavesdropper. To this end, we first derive the expression of the secrecy outage probability for uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs), which is valid for arbitrary values of system parameters. The expression is practicable in the UAV-enabled mobile relaying system as the system parameters are time-variant with the movement of the UAV. Using this expression, we study the secrecy outage probability minimization problem by optimizing the 3D beamforming direction along with the trajectory of the UAV, subject to the mobility constraint and location constraint. To solve this problem, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by comparing to other benchmark schemes, they also show the system with UCAs outperforms the system with ULAs on secrecy outage probability performance.",Drone,2019
Nonlinear Robust Compensation Method for Trajectory Tracking Control of Quadrotors,"In this paper, a nonlinear robust control method is developed for trajectory tracking of a quadrotor aircraft. The proposed approach combines the robust signal compensation method and the backstepping technique. First, the quadrotor dynamic system with multiple disturbances and uncertainties is divided into four subsystems. Then, the nominal controllers are constructed for the subsystems without disturbance terms, while the robust signal compensators are introduced to compensate for the effect of nonlinearities and uncertainties. Furthermore, the Lyapunov analysis has shown that the proposed controller can achieve stable tracking in the presence of violent discontinuous disturbances and uncertainties. The tracking error converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero. Finally, the proposed control design is validated with real flight experiments. The results show superior trajectory tracking performance of the quadrotor system affected by external disturbances.",Drone,2019
A Experimental Study of Aerodynamic Interference on Quad-Tilt Propeller UAV Wings in Forward Flight Condition,"In this study, wind tunnel test on Quad-Tilt Propeller which has tandem wings is carried out to analyze the aerodynamic interference effect of front wing and propeller on rear wing during forward flight. Using 6-axis balance system, forces and moments of whole aircraft were measured and using strain gauge at wing root, bending moments were measured to observe change of aerodynamic force of each wings. A 12-hole probe was used to measure the flow field in the wing and propeller wake. Flow characteristics were observed qualitatively through flow visualization experiment using tuft and smoke. To measure the aerodynamic interference by elements, the influence of front wing and propeller on rear wing was analyzed by changing the wings and propellers mount combination.",Drone,2019
Design and Performance Verification of L1 Adaptive Flight Control Law Considering the Change of Center of Gravity for Unmanned Tailless Aircraft,"Tailless aircraft have advantages of low visibility compared to conventional aircraft, but drawback of poor stability as well which makes designing controller difficult. The controller design is more difficult, especially when the center of gravity moves due to store release or fuel consumption during flight. In this paper, an L1 adaptive controller is proposed as a way to overcome these problems. The reliability and performance of the controllers were verified by non-linear simulations. RPV Flying Quality Design criteria were used for design criteria. Using the simulation, it is shown that the adaptive controller maintains stability of the unmanned aircraft for sudden large change in the inertial properties. It is also shown that the calculation burden can be reduced when it is used with the gain scheduling method.",Drone,2019

In the proposed method, a turbo decoder with a double buffer controller is proposed to apply turbo decoder with long decoding time to asymmetric TDD system. The proposed method achieves variable data transfer rate and maximum data transfer rate. The advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated by its data transfer rate. The measured data transfer rate is more than 1.8 times than that of symmetric TDD system. In addition, PER(Packet Error Rate) performance is the same and data transfer rate is variable.",Drone,2019
Calibration of VLP-16 Lidar Sensor and Vision Cameras Using the Center Coordinates of a Spherical Object,"360 degree 3-dimensional lidar sensors and vision cameras are commonly used in the development of autonomous driving techniques for automobile, drone, etc. By the way, existing calibration techniques for obtaining th e external transformation of the lidar and the camera sensors have disadvantages in that special calibration objects are used or the object size is too large. In this paper, we introduce a simple calibration method between two sensors using a spherical object. We calculated the sphere center coordinates using four 3-D points selected by RANSAC of the range data of the sphere. The 2-dimensional coordinates of the object center in the camera image are also detected to calibrate the two sensors. Even when the range data is acquired from various angles, the image of the spherical object always maintains a circular shape. The proposed method results in about 2 pixel reprojection error, and the performance of the proposed technique is analyzed by comparing with the existing methods.",Drone,2019
Classification of UAV-to-Ground Vehicles Based on Micro-Doppler Signatures Using Singular Value Decomposition and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Attack from the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been the main means of high-precision strike. Therefore, classifying ground vehicles from the UAV with high accuracy is of great significance. In order to avoid the complex feature extracting process and realize the classification of UAV-to-ground vehicles in different situations, this paper proposed a method based on micro-Doppler signatures using singular value decomposition (SVD) and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). First, models of UAV-to-ground vehicles are built to analyze the micro-Doppler components and Doppler signals in five different cases are given. Second, time-frequency spectrums of Doppler signals with low signal-to-noise ratios are improved after removing noise using SVD. Third, transfer-learning of pre-trained DCNNs is achieved using measured data and classification under various conditions is realized using the new-trained network. When there is no noise, the overall classification accuracy of two types of Doppler signals, three types of Doppler signals, four types of Doppler signals and five types of Doppler signals has reached 100%, 97%, 97%, and 96%, respectively. Comparison with current methods which need to extract micro-Doppler features by time-frequency techniques are also made. Outstanding performance proves the superiority and robustness of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Secure and Reliable Resource Allocation and Caching in Aerial-Terrestrial Cloud Networks (ATCNs),"Aerial-terrestrial cloud networks (ATCNs), global integration of air and ground communication systems, pave a way for a large set of applications such as surveillance, on-demand transmissions, data-acquisition, and navigation. However, such networks suffer from crucial challenges of secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching as the involved entities are highly dynamic and there is no fine-tuned strategy to accommodate their connectivity. To resolve this quandary, cog-chain, a novel paradigm for secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching in ATCNs, is presented. Various requirements, key concepts, and issues with ATCNs are also presented along with basic concepts to establish a cog-chain in ATCNs. Feed and fetch modes are utilized depending on the involved entities and caching servers. In addition, a cog-chain communication protocol is presented which avails to evaluate the formation of a virtual cog-chain between the nodes and the content-caching servers. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated through consequential gains observed for signaling overheads, computational time, reliability, and resource allocation growth. The proposed approach operates with the signaling overheads ranging between 30.36 and 303.6 bytes*hops/sec and the formation time between 186 and 195 ms. Furthermore, the overall time consumption is 83.33% lower than the sequential-verification model and the resource allocation growth is 27.17% better than the sequential-verification model.",Drone,2019
Joint CoMP Transmission for UAV-Aided Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks,"This paper investigates a novel architecture of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission in the cognitive satellite-terrestrial network associated with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We consider the downlink communication where the UAV and base station (BS) cooperatively serve the terrestrial user by sharing the licensed satellite network spectrum. The goal of this paper is to maximize the achievable rate of the terrestrial user by jointly optimizing BS/UAV transmit power allocation and UAV trajectory, subjecting to the interference temperature threshold imposed on satellite network as well as UAV mobility constraint. The formulated problem is shown in a complicated non-convex form, which is hard to tackle. To this end, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, and the block coordinate descent method is employed to solve the two sub-problems alternately. Specifically, for the first sub-problem, the optimal BS/UAV transmit power is obtained with a given UAV trajectory by using the Lagrangian dual method. For the second sub-problem, the UAV trajectory is attained with a given BS/UAV power allocation by using the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposed joint CoMP transmission scheme significantly improves the terrestrial network throughput compared with other benchmark schemes.",Drone,2019
On the Outage Probability and Power Control of D2D Underlaying NOMA UAV-Assisted Networks,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) nowadays is a promising technology for boosting wireless connectivity, especially for upcoming 5G wireless networks. Due to its aerial feature, potential mobility and flexible deployment, the UAV can provide service in some specific scenarios such as post-disaster network recovery or no-infrastructure terrains. However, the problem of interference management between deployed UAV and underlaying heterogeneous networks, which guarantees the quality of service, is still a challenging task. In this paper, we address the outage probability for UAV connected users and device-to-device (D2D) receivers simultaneously operating in D2D underlaying NOMA UAV-assisted networks, and we derive its closed-form expressions, which turns out to be very accurate. We also solve the power control optimization problem via relaxing the non-convex problem into solving successive low-complexity linear programs to obtain a sub-optimal solution to the problem. The simulation results in confirm the superiority of the proposed approach in the terms of computational complexity and its compromise in the terms of sum rate.",Drone,2019
Unmanned Water-Powered Aerial Vehicles: Theory and Experiments,"Water-powered jetpacks have become a well-known recreational product in water theme parks. It requires a large number of skills to operate them. And it is difficult for visitors, particularly for kids and elders, to master these skills in a limited period of time. This paper designed several unmanned water-powered aerial vehicles (UWAVs) to deal with this dilemma. Two types of actuating mechanism are proposed, each of which is applied in different UWAVs. The dynamics of the two types of UWAV is modeled and analyzed. Several UWAV prototypes, including airframes, actuators, controllers with PD algorithm, and inertial sensors, are fabricated. Under the control of the onboard controllers, the prototypes can achieve attitude stabilization. One can use a remote control to drive a prototype to perform specific tasks. The experimental results are provided, and the experimental mission demonstrations show that the UWAVs could be used in recreation as well as other fields, such as fire extinguishing, salvage, fast transportation on water, and underwater detection.",Drone,2019
Analysis and Optimization of unmanned Aerial Vechicle in Swarms in Logistics: An Intelligent Delivery Platform,"Deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in delivery systems are still in its infancy with regard to the technology, safety, and aviation rules and regulations. Optimal use of UAVs in dynamic environments is important in many aspects, e.g., increasing efficacy and reducing the air traffic, resulting in a safer environment, and it requires new techniques and robust approaches based on the capabilities of UAVs and constraints. This paper analyzes several delivery schemes within a platform, such as delivery with and without using air highways and delivery using a hybrid scheme along with several delivery methods (i.e., optimal, premium, and first-in first-out) to explore the use of UAV swarms as part of the logistics operations. In this platform, a dimension reduction technique, ""dynamic multiple assignments in multidimensional space,"" and several other new techniques along with Hungarian and cross-entropy Monte Carlo techniques are forged together to assign tasks and plan 3D routes dynamically. This particular approach is performed in such a way that UAV swarms in several warehouses are deployed optimally given the delivery scheme, method, and constraints. Several scenarios are tested on the simulator using small and big data sets. The results show that the distribution and the characteristics of data sets and constraints affect the decision on choosing the optimal delivery scheme and the method. The findings are expected to guide the aviation authorities in their decisions before dictating rules and regulations regarding effective, efficient, and safe use of UAVs. Furthermore, the companies that produce UAVs are going to take the demonstrated results into account for their functional design of UAVs along with other companies that aim to deliver their products using UAVs. Additionally, private industries, logistics operators, and municipalities are expected to benefit from the potential adoption of the simulator in strategic decisions before embarking on the practical implementation of UAV delivery systems.",Drone,2019
Centroid Vectoring for Attitude Control of Floating Base Robots: From Maritime to Aerial Applications,"In this paper, we show the uses of centroid vectoring for attitude control of floating base robots. To derive the control algorithm, we utilize dynamical and kinematic robot model, and ubiquitous Jacobian matrix, which allows us to control the orientation of the main body of a robot by adjusting the control input to its actuators. Controlling the orientation of the main body of a robot is important because it is typically where the sensors, scientific payload, and/or manipulators are attached. The experiments on aerial and underwater vehicles using the same algorithm show how this method can translate across different platforms and actuation methods. The simulation and experimental results are shown in this paper on air (mu MORUS) and sea (AquaShoko) platforms.",Drone,2019
Evolving Rule-Based Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"In this paper, an explainable intelligence model that gives the logic behind the decisions unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) makes when it is on a predefined mission and chooses to deviate from its designated path is developed. The explainable model is on a visual platform in the format of if-then rules derived from the Sugeno-type fuzzy inference model. The model is tested using the data recorded from three different missions. In each mission, adverse weather, conditions and enemy locations are introduced at random locations along the path of the mission. There are two phases to the model development. In the first phase, the Mamdani fuzzy model is used to create rules to steer the UAV along the designated mission and the rules of engagement when it encounters weather and enemy locations along and near its chosen mission. The data are gathered as UAV traverses on each mission. In the second phase, the data gathered from these missions are used to create a reverse model using a Sugeno-type fuzzy inference system based on the subtractive clustering in the data. The model has seven inputs (time, x-coordinate, y-coordinate, heading direction, engage in attack, continue mission, and steer UAV) and two outputs (weather conditions and distance from the enemy). This model predicts the outputs regarding the weather conditions and enemy positions whenever UAV deviates from the predefined path. The model is optimized with respect to the number of rules and prediction accuracy by adjusting subtractive clustering parameters. The model is then fine-tuned with ANFIS. The final model has six rules and root mean square error value that is less than 0.05. Furthermore, to check the robustness of the model, the Gaussian random noise is added to a UAV path, and the prediction accuracy is validated.",Drone,2019

The aerial photographs were merged using GIS software; the volume of the changing topography attributable to quarrying activities and the size of the affected area were identified and mapped in a fast and reliable manner using the spatial data.",Drone,2019
An Efficient UAV Hijacking Detection Method Using Onboard Inertial Measurement Unit,"With the fast growth of civil drones, their security problems meet significant challenges. A commercial drone may be hijacked by a GPS-spoofing attack for illegal activities, such as terrorist attacks. The target of this article is to develop a technique that only uses onboard gyroscopes to determine whether a drone has been hijacked.Ideally, GPS data and the angular velocities measured by gyroscopes can be used to estimate the acceleration of a drone, which can be further compared with the measurement of the accelerometer to detect whether a drone has been hijacked. However, the detection results may not always be accurate due to some calculation and measurement errors, especially when no hijacking occurs in curve trajectory situations. To overcome this, in this article, we propose a novel and simple method to detect hijacking only based on gyroscopes' measurements and GPS data, without using any accelerometer in the detection procedure. The computational complexity of our method is very low, which is suitable to be implemented in the drones with micro-controllers. On the other hand, the proposed method does not rely on any accelerometer to detect attacks, which means it receives less information in the detection procedure and may reduce the results accuracy in some special situations. While the previous method can compensate for this flaw, the high detection results also can be guaranteed by using the above two methods. Experiments with a quad-rotor drone are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the combination method.",Drone,2019
Combustion characteristics of a two-stroke spark ignition UAV engine fuelled with gasoline and kerosene (RP-3),"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to compare the combustion characteristics, including the combustion pressure, heat release rate (HRR), coefficient of variation (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), flame development period and combustion duration, of aviation kerosene fuel, namely, rocket propellant 3 (RP-3), and gasoline on a two-stoke spark ignition engine.Design/methodology/approach This paper is an experimental investigation using a bench test to reflect the combustion performance of two-stroke spark ignition unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) engine on gasoline and RP-3 fuel.Findings Under low load conditions, the combustion performance and HRR of burning RP-3 fuel were shown to be worse than those of gasoline. Under high load conditions, the average IMEP and the COV of IMEP of burning RP-3 fuel were close to those of gasoline. The difference in the flame development period between gasoline and RP-3 fuel was similar.Practical implications Gasoline fuel has a low flash point, high-saturated vapour pressure and relatively high volatility and is a potential hazard near a naked flame at room temperature, which can create significant security risks for its storage, transport and use. Adopting a low volatility single RP-3 fuel of covering all vehicles and equipment to minimize the number of different devices with the use of a various fuels and improve the application safeties.Originality/value Most two-stroke spark ignition UAV engines continue to combust gasoline. A kerosene-based fuel operation can be applied to achieve a single-fuel policy.",Drone,2019
Sharing Location Information in Multi-UAV Systems by Common Channel Multi-Token Circulation Method in FANETs,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is being used increasingly for military and civilian purposes. The primary reason for this increase is that UAVs eliminate the risk to human life in difficult and dangerous missions, are cost effective, and easily are deployed. Developments in UAV technology and decreasing costs have increased UAV usage. However, when multiple UAVs are deployed, inter UAV communication becomes complicated. For this reason, communication in multi-UAV systems is the most important problem that needs to be solved. To enable communication among UAVs without infrastructure support, a Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) is used. A FANET provides UAVs to fly in tandem without colliding. To ensure coordinated flight, UAVs require the location information of other UAVs. In this study, we developed a common channel multi-token circulation protocol to share location information in multi-UAV systems that communicate using a FANET. The proposed method ensures that UAVs in multi-UAV systems know each other's coordinate information with minimum error.",Drone,2019
Spectrum Management for MmWave Enabled UAV Swarm Networks: Challenges and Opportunities,"In wireless communications, as the spatio-temporal distribution of the traffic is dynamic, the performance degradation of cellular networks becomes inevitable. Especially in catastrophic scenarios or hot-spot areas, terrestrial base stations may be poorly functioning and/or congested; thus, deploying ASCs that were carried by a UAV swarm is reasonable and cost-effective. Moreover, services such as disaster evaluation and live broadcasting require high-definition video streams, which undoubtedly need broad-band wireless transmission. To achieve this goal, the mmWave approach is introduced in the UAV swarm. However, wireless backhaul links, the mobility of UAVs and system coexistence hamper performance. In this article, we propose a novel spectrum management (SM) architecture for UAV-assisted cellular networks. Considering the special feature of mmWave, we also study SM techniques for opportunistic utilization of low-altitude UAV swarm using multi-mode radio access technologies (RATs). Both motivations and challenges of the proposed SM architecture for the UAV swarm are analyzed. To evaluate the performances of the proposed mmWave based wireless backhaul in UAV-assisted cellular networks, different SM schemes have been discussed and verified with numerical results in five typical scenarios.",Drone,2019
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for mmWave Drone Networks With Limited Feedback,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) base stations (BSs) can be a promising solution to provide connectivity and quality-of- service guarantees during temporary events and after disasters. In this paper, we consider a scenario where UAV-BSs are serving a large number of mobile users in a hot spot area (e.g., in a stadium). We introduce non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) transmission at UAV-BSs to serve more users simultaneously considering user distances as the available feedback for a user ordering during NOMA formulation. With millimeter-wave transmission and multi-antenna techniques, we assume that UAV-BS generates directional beams and multiple users are served simultaneously within the same beam. However, due to the limitations of physical vertical beamwidth of the UAV-BS beam, it may not be possible to cover the entire user region at UAV altitudes of practical relevance. During such situations, a beam scanning approach is proposed to maximize the achievable sum rates. We develop a comprehensive framework over which outage probabilities and respective sum rates are derived rigorously and we investigate the optimal operational altitude of UAV-BS to maximize the sum rates using our analytical framework. Our analysis shows that NOMA with distance feedback can provide better outage sum rates than orthogonal multiple access.",Drone,2019
Communications and Control for Wireless Drone-Based Antenna Array,"In this paper, the effective use of multiple quadrotor drones as an aerial antenna array that provides wireless service to ground users is investigated. In particular, under the goal of minimizing the airborne service time needed for communicating with ground users, a novel framework for deploying and operating a drone-based antenna array system whose elements are single-antenna drones is proposed. In the considered model, the service time is minimized by minimizing the wireless transmission time as well as the control time that is needed for movement and stabilization of the drones. To minimize the transmission time, first, the antenna array gain is maximized by optimizing the drone spacing within the array. In this case, using perturbation techniques, the drone spacing optimization problem is addressed by solving successive, perturbed convex optimization problems. Then, according to the location of each ground user, the optimal locations of the drones around the array's center are derived such that the transmission time for the user is minimized. Given the determined optimal locations of drones, the drones must spend a control time to adjust their positions dynamically so as to serve multiple users. To minimize this control time of the quadrotor drones, the speed of rotors is optimally adjusted based on both the destinations of the drones and external forces (e.g., wind and gravity). In particular, using bang-bang control theory, the optimal rotors' speeds as well as the minimum control time are derived in closed-form. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce the service time to ground users compared with a fixed-array case in which the same number of drones form a fixed uniform antenna array. The results also show that, in comparison with the fixed-array case, the network's spectral efficiency can be improved by 32% while leveraging the drone antenna array system. Finally, the results reveal an inherent tradeoff between the control time and transmission time while varying the number of drones in the array.",Drone,2019
A Hybrid-Duplex System With Joint Detection for Interference-Limited UAV Communications,"In this paper, the advantages of joint detection (JD) in a hybrid-duplex unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system (HBD-UCS) are investigated as a step toward addressing spectrum scarcity in UAV communications. Through extensive outage probability and finite signal-to-noise-ratio diversity gain analysis, we showed that the performance of JD is independent of the strength and the data rate of the inter-UAV interference signal. On the contrary, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector requires the data rate of the interfering UAV to be less than the ground station before meaningful performance can be seen. At the system level, it is observed that the half-duplex UAV communication system outperforms the HBD-UCS with JD at moderate and high SNR regimes, as the latter is constrained by self-interference at the full-duplex ground station. Finally, we investigated the multiplexing gain region and showed that the joint detector offers higher diversity gain over a wide range of multiplexing gains over the interference ignorant and the SIC detector.",Drone,2019
Investigation of Antennas Integrated Into Disposable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"The integration of antennas into disposable paper drones using inkjet printing technology is presented. These drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are developed using origami folding structures. Two vertical monopole antennas based on the same design concept are proposed and their performance assessed for two different conditions. The conditions relate to the placement of the other electronic components and circuits on the origami drones as reported in the literature. The first is when the electromechanical components and corresponding metallic layers are located in the wings. In this case, the effect of the possible location of the antenna as well as the deformation of the wings on S-11 is discussed. The second is a more general case scenario which includes when the components and motors are placed at the tail and lower part of the body of the drone. The antenna elements are directly printed onto a photo paper substrate using silver nanoparticle conductive ink. Subsequently, the substrate is folded to create a paper drone. Low-cost desktop inkjet printing equipment is used to deposit the metallic tracks of the antenna. The designs target the current frequency bands employed in the control and wireless communication of commercial drones (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands). The purpose of this work is to investigate potential antenna scenarios for disposable drones which may one day be fully fabricated using inkjet printing technology. All antenna designs and studies have been simulated using CST Microwave Studio and compared well with experimental results.",Drone,2019
Multibeam for Joint Communication and Radar Sensing Using Steerable Analog Antenna Arrays,"Beamforming has a great potential for joint communication and radar sensing (JCAS), which is becoming a demanding feature on many emerging platforms, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and smart cars. Although beamforming has been extensively studied for communication and radar sensing respectively, its application in the joint system is not straightforward due to different beamforming requirements by communication and sensing. In this paper, we propose a novel multibeam framework using steerable analog antenna arrays, which allows seamless integration of communication and sensing. Different to conventional JCAS schemes that support JCAS using a single beam, our framework is based on the key innovation of multibeam technology: providing fixed subbeam for communication and packet-varying scanning subbeam for sensing, simultaneously from a single transmitting array. We provide a system architecture and protocols for the proposed framework, complying well with modern packet communication systems with multicarrier modulation. We also propose low-complexity and effective multibeam design and generation methods, which offer great flexibility in meeting different communication and sensing requirements. We further develop sensing parameter estimation algorithms using conventional digital Fourier transform and one-dimensional compressive sensing techniques, matching well with the multibeam framework. Simulation results are provided and validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, beamforming design methods, and the sensing algorithms.",Drone,2019
Efficient and Fair Network Selection for Integrated Cellular and Drone-Cell Networks,"This paper is concerned with the network selection for heterogeneous networks. Although many network selection approaches have been developed for heterogeneous networks, few of them explore the network selection problem for integrated cellular and drone-cell networks. Furthermore, most of the existing designs may be unsuitable for the integrated cellular and drone-cell networks owing to the high dynamic drone-cell-user association and the relatively limited drone-cell network capacity. In this paper, we investigate a network selection problem for the integrated cellular and drone-cell networks with a goal of maximizing a proportional fairness function of time average utilities across users under coarse correlated equilibrium constraints and minimum time average utility constraints. To mitigate this challenging problem, we first convert it into a non-linear integer programming (NLIP) problem based on our derived theoretical results. Next, we propose a repeated-stochastic-game-based efficient and fair network selection (RSG-EF) algorithm to alleviate the NLIP problem by leveraging a linear approximation mechanism. Simulation results show that the RSG-EF algorithm can achieve the highest total utility and a high level of fairness across users compared with three benchmark algorithms.",Drone,2019
Resource Allocation and Basestation Placement in Cellular Networks With Wireless Powered UAVs,"In this correspondence, we focus on a UAV-assisted downlink cellular network, where a UAV serves as an aerial basestation (BS) and is powered by a wireless charging station located on the ground, and jointly optimize resource allocation and BS placement to maximize the common throughput for two resource sharing schemes: time division multiple access (TDMA) and frequency division multiple access (FDMA). Through alternate optimization, resource allocation and BS placement are separately optimized to iteratively improve the common throughput. For resource allocation, we derive the closed-form solutions for both TDMA and FDMA. For BS placement, we resort to successive convex optimization that iteratively maximizes a lower bound. Results show that with the proposed optimal resource allocation and BS placement, resource can be fully utilized and the aerial BS's location can be properly adjusted such that it significantly outperforms a baseline strategy, by which resource is equally shared among ground users. Moreover, it is also observed that the FDMA scheme outperforms the TDMA scheme due to longer effective transmission duration.",Drone,2019
A Hierarchical and Prioritized Framework in Coordinated Maneuver of Multiple Uavs Based on Guidance Regulator,"ABSTRACT The structure of mission management and maneuver planning for multiple UAVs in close formation flight is investigated. This article provides a distributed and priority-based platform of guidance and control model to meet requirements for each coordinated maneuver. To accomplish the coordinated maneuvers of multiple UAVs, some levels of hierarchy from mission planning to accurate guidance law are presented. The main focuses have been on the structure of equations and vicinity pattern to avoid a probable collision during maneuver so the high-level decision-maker can integrate all irregularities and solve them at the same time. Unlike complex control systems, the proposed algorithm provides outstanding following performance and inherent collision avoidance pattern due to prioritized tracking. The results show the admissible performance of the framework designed for implementing coordinated maneuvers due to its lower collision probability and noise resistance. According to the simulations, this method also resolves irregularity and disarrangements in the close formation flights and tracking media.",Drone,2019
Toroidal-Shaped Coils for a Wireless Power Transfer System for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using communications, sensors, and navigation equipment will play a key role in future warfare. Currently, UAVs are monitored to prevent misfire and accidents, and the conventional method adopted uses wires for data transmission and power supply. The repeated connection and disconnection of cables increases maintenance time and harms the connector. For convenience and stability, a wireless power transfer system to power UAVs is needed. Unlike other wireless power transfer (WPT) applications, the size of the receiving coils must be small, so that the WPT systems can be embedded inside space-limited UAVs. The small size reduces the coupling coefficient and transfer efficiency between the transmitting and the receiving coils. In this study, we propose a toroidal-shaped coil for a WPT system for UAVs with high coupling coefficient with minimum space requirements. For validation, conventional coils and the proposed toroidal-shaped coil were used and their coupling coefficient and power transfer efficiency were compared using simulated and measured results. The simulated and measured results were strongly correlated, confirming that the proposed WPT system significantly improved efficiency with negligible change in the space requirement.",Drone,2019
Detection for Rotating Blades in Radar by Using Cepstrum,"This paper proposes a cepstrum method in a CW(continuous wave) radar system to detect rotating blades of a drone. Since the size of the drone is much smaller than that of the conventional aircraft, it is difficult to detect by using the conventional detection method. Therefore, a detection method utilizing the Doppler characteristic generated by the rotating blades of the drone has been proposed. There is the STFT(Short Time Fourier Transform) method as a representative detection method using the Doppler characteristic. The STFT method has a disadvantage that a long calculation time is required because of a process of accumulating signals repeatedly. In this paper, to overcome disadvantages of STFT method, the cepstrum method is applied to detect the rotating blades. First, we model the radar cross-section of the rotating blades and then apply the cepstrum method on the received signal of the radar including the Doppler characteristic. Finally, from the simulation results for the performance evaluation, we can see that, in the cepstrum method, it is easily verified the rotating blades of a drone by comparing the threshold and we can find the information of the rotating speed.",Drone,2019
Vegetation Map Service System Using UAV Imagery and Sample Field Data on Major Cultivation Regions,"As the use of UAVs is growing across many civil applications, more and more researches are being carried out to utilize them in monitoring crops and cultivated areas. The National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NAS) has been acquiring UAV imagery on the five most popular vegetables in Korea, namely cabbage, radish, onion, garlic and pepper, and has been producing vegetation maps based on sample measurements and NDVI. In this study, the process of producing a vegetation map, the computation of NDVI using UAV imagery, and the algorithm used to make a crop prediction model on major cultivation regions will be introduced. The GIS-based vegetation map service system and UAV imagery would allow a more regular and scientific observation on wide cultivation areas, as compared to a conventional man-based field survey, and provide useful information to relevant authorities and researchers in a timely manner. We expect the information provided by the web service system to be used as a basis for establishing a resilient vegetable supply policy and reasonable farming plan.",Drone,2019
Extraction of Tidal Creeks using MCSF Algorithm and UAV Surveying Data,"Determining the shape and location of the tidal creeks is an important issue in the topographical researches of tidal flats. In this study, we developed a methodology to extract the location and shape of tidal creeks revealed at low tide by using dense point clouds obtained from UAV. For this purpose, the initial points of the tidal creeks were determined using the modified cloth simulation filtering(MCSF) algorithm. Then, tidal creeks were refined by applying the morphological filter. Also, their depths were calculated from the elevation difference between the tidal creeks and ground. As a result, it was possible to extract automatically the tidal creeks of less than 2m in depth and to develop the methodology for the production of the large-scale tidal creek map.",Drone,2019
Multi Objective Vehicle and Drone Routing Problem with Time Window,"In this paper, we study the multi-objectives vehicle and drone routing problem with time windows, MOVDRPTW for short, which is defined in an urban delivery network. We consider the dual modal delivery system consisting of drones and vehicles. Drones are used as a complement to the vehicle and operate in a point to point manner between the depot and the customer. Customers make various requests. They prefer to receive delivery services within the predetermined time range and some customers require fast delivery. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of the delivery strategy of using drones and vehicles together with a multi-objective measures. As experiment datasets, we use the instances generated based on actual courier delivery data. We propose a hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for solving MOVDRPTW. Our results confirm that the vehicle-drone mixed strategy has 30% cost advantage over vehicle only strategy.",Drone,2019
Dynamic modeling and characteristic analysis of piezoelectric rudder actuator,"In this note, dynamic equations of the piezoelectric rudder actuator are established using a numerical method, and the dynamic characteristics are analyzed. A simulation is performed using finite element software to verify the validity of the theory. The results show that an increase in axial force has significant amplification effects on the static displacement output of the bimorph and its rudder actuator, and the axial stiffness of the piezoelectric bimorph is evidently nonlinear against larger axial force. The response time of the rudder actuator is less affected by the axial force and remains in the order of milliseconds under the axial force of 0.85 times the buckling critical load.

An Efficient Algorithm for Detection of Image Stretching Error from a Collection of Images Acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,"Over the recent years, the advantages of using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have provided fascinating working areas, particularly for photogrammetric goals. One of the main problems preventing the UAV data to achieve fully automated processing is the image stretching error and reduced resolution or image blurring, which is caused by camera shake during shooting or slow shutter speed. Movements of the sensors may be due to normal motions during the flight, strong winds, lack of proper functioning of the gimbal stabilizer or an operator's lack of skill for properly controlling the drone. Image blurring negatively affects data interpretation and visual analysis, which in turn raises challenges for detection and matching algorithms; as a result, the precision of automatic processing and accuracy of the extracted geometrical information would decrease. Time-consuming and costly manual methods are typically adopted to identify and remove images with radiometric errors. Such methods are tedious, especially for large datasets and bring about high margin of errors. In this paper, an automatic and reliable algorithm is presented to identify and distinguish blurred images. The aim is to extract the saturation blue difference (SBD) parameter from the sets of images. It is known that SBD value has a direct relationship with the amount of blurring. The numerical value of the parameter is determined based on the variation in the extracted edge pixels of blurred and non-blurred images. Evaluation on two datasets indicates that the proposed algorithm based on the selected threshold limit (defined with regard to the geometric and visual requirements of images) for the SBD values can recognize the images with the SBD values less than the threshold value as blurred images with 100% certainty and extract them from the sets of obtained images.",Drone,2019
Blind Detection: Advanced Techniques for WiFi-Based Drone Surveillance,"The great availability of commercial drones has raised growing interest among people, since remotely piloted vehicles can be employed in numerous applications. The pervasive use of these devices has created many privacy and safety concerns that need to be addressed by means of proper surveillance systems able to cope with such threats. In this paper, we propose a WiFi statistical fingerprint-based drone detection approach, which is capable of identifying nearby drone threats, even in the presence of malicious attacks. We present a performance analysis carried out through experimental tests, where our solution is able to achieve very good results in terms of correct recognitions in many real-life scenarios, with a peak true positive rate of 96%.",Drone,2019
Beyond 5G With UAVs: Foundations of a 3D Wireless Cellular Network,"In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.",Drone,2019
Aeromagnetic system for a Multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle based on the Overhauser sensor,"Aeromagnetic surveys using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can be used in low-altitude detailed detection of small-scale magnetic anomalies and offers an auxiliary means for geomagnetic survey on land. However, excessive weight of the detection instruments and strong magnetic interference remain problems. To address them, an aeromagnetic system for a multi-rotor UAV based on the Overhauser sensor was designed. To ensure aeromagnetic surveys have high precision and are omnidirectional and fast, a miniaturized Overhauser sensor and a narrow-band tuned filter were designed and a short-time high-precision measurement method was proposed. Furthermore, the ridge regression is used to reduce the adverse effects of multicollinearity and enhance the stability of the compensation coefficient estimators. Both laboratory and flight tests were conducted. Overall, the results show that the static and dynamic noise is 0.029 nT, 0.041 nT, respectively, and the improvement ratio of aeromagnetic interference is 4.38 in the dynamic tests; a test of iron pipe detection was performed to verify the overall performance of the aeromagnetic system.",Drone,2019
A Compact Integration of a 77 GHz FMCW Radar System Using CMOS Transmitter and Receiver Adopting On-Chip Monopole Feeder,"This paper presents 77-GHz CMOS radar transmitter and receiver chips equipped with monopole feeders for use in frequency-modulated continuous-wave radar systems. The on-chip monopole feeder can feed not only the aperture of waveguides but also the slots on planar circuits by simply attaching the chips to a printed circuit board using a low-cost non-conductive epoxy. With the aid of a high ratio multiplier and the proposed on-chip feeder, a radar system can easily be integrated without needing to use precise and expensive millimeter-wave packaging technologies. In order to experimentally confirm this, the chips integrated with waveguides are first measured and a full radar system integrated on the planar circuit is evaluated using the microstrip patch antennas. Finally, with the benefit of compact integration technology, the design of a five-channel 3-D environmental sensing radar for small-unmanned aerial vehicles is presented.",Drone,2019
3D Simulation Modeling of UAC-to-Car communications,"In this paper, we propose a realistic model for simulating communications between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, and ground vehicles, which can support mobile infrastructure to broadcast alerts in emergency situations. Three-dimensional positioning features should be considered in these simulations that involve UAVs and ground vehicles since communications links are not based on a flat surface. In fact, irregular terrains in the form of hills and mountains can greatly affect the communications by acting as obstacles that block radio signals partially or totally. Hence, in this paper, we propose a simulation model that conforms to this kind of communication and that was developed in the scope of the OMNeT++ simulator. The simulation results achieved showed a great degree of similarities with those results obtained in a real testbed for different scenarios. In addition, various path loss models and elevation models were considered to improve the level of realism of the simulation model.",Drone,2019
Numerical Simulation and Experimental Analysis of Small Drone Rotor Blade Polarimetry Based on RCS and Micro-Doppler Signature,"Detecting and tracking small drones is significant for security requirements, but is challenging since small drones typically have a low radar cross section (RCS), small size, and hovering ability. Polarimetric analysis of returned radio wave is of great significance in detection and track of small drones. In this letter, the polarimetric analysis based on RCS and micro-Doppler signature of small drone rotor blade is first studied in VHF/UHF band. Both the simulated and measured RCS results confirm that the horizontal-horizontal polarization is preferred for drone detection in low-altitude angles at this frequency band. Moreover, the method of moments, a rigorous numerical method based on integral equation, is implemented to simulate the micro-Doppler signature generated by the rotating blade in VHF/UHF band. The results show that it is feasible to obtain the rotating speed from the micro-Doppler measurement, which is also verified by the experiment.",Drone,2019
Method for Detecting User Positions with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Based on Doppler Shifts,"Unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) have been developed and studied as temporal communication systems for emergency and rescue services during disasters, such as earthquakes and serious accidents. In a typical UAS model, several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used to provide services over a large area. The UAV is comprised of a transmitter and receiver to transmit/receive the signals to/from terrestrial stations and terminals. Therefore, the carrier frequencies of the transmitted and received signals experience Doppler shifts due to the variations in the line-of-sight velocity between the UAV and the terrestrial terminal. Thus, by observing multiple Doppler shifts from different UAVs, it is possible to detect the position of a user that possesses a communication terminal for the UAS. This study aims to present a methodology for position detection based on the least-squares method to the Doppler shift frequencies. Further, a positioning accuracy index is newly proposed, which can be used as an index for measuring the position accurately, instead of the dilution-of-precision (DOP) method, which is used for global positioning systems (GPSs). A computer simulation was conducted for two different flight route models to confirm the applicability of the proposed positioning method and the positioning accuracy index. The simulation results confirm that the parameters, such as the flight route, the initial position, and velocity of the UAVs, can be optimized by using the proposed positioning accuracy index.",Drone,2019

The PID controller is developed following an adaptive neural technique, and its stability is verified by the Lyapunov discrete theory. Besides, the neural identification of the dynamic model of the UAV is presented to backpropagate output errors to adjust PID gains with the purpose of reducing the control errors. The validation of the proposed algorithm is performed through experimental results with a hexacopter.",Drone,2019
Adaptive finite-time formation tracking control for multiple nonholonomic UAV system with uncertainties and quantized input,"An adaptive finite-time formation tracking control approach is proposed for multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system with quantized input signals in this paper. The UAVs are described by nonholonomic kinematic model and autopilot model with uncertainties. An enhanced hysteretic quantizer is introduced to avoid chattering, and some restrictions are released by using a new quantization decomposition method. Based on backstepping technique and finite-time Lyapunov stability theory, the adaptive finite-time controller is designed for the trajectory tracking of the multi-UAV formation. The nonholonomic constraints are solved by a transverse function. A transformation is introduced to the control input signals to eliminate the quantization effect. Stability analysis proves that the tracking errors can converge to a small neighborhood of the origin within finite time and all the closed-loop signals are semiglobally finite-time bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed control approach is validated by simulation and experiment.",Drone,2019
Drone scheduling to monitor vessels in emission control areas,"The use of drones to monitor the emissions of vessels has recently attracted wide attention because of its great potentials for enforcing regulations in emission control areas (ECAs). Motivated by this potential application, we study how drones can be scheduled to monitor the sailing vessels in ECAs, which is defined as a drone scheduling problem (DSP) in this paper. The objective of the DSP is to design a group of flight tours for drones, including the inspection sequence and timings for the vessels, such that as many vessels as possible can be inspected during a given time period while prioritizing highly weighted vessels for inspection. We show that the DSP can be regarded as a generalized team orienteering problem, which is known to be NP-hard, and deriving solutions for this problem can be more difficult because additional complicated features, such as time-dependent locations, multiple trips for a drone, and multiple stations (or depots), are addressed simultaneously. To overcome these difficulties, we model the dynamics of each sailing vessel using a real-time location function in a deterministic fashion. This approach allows us to approximately represent the problem on a time-expanded network, based on which a network flow-based formulation can be formally developed. To solve this proposed formulation, we further develop a Lagrangian relaxation-based method that can obtain near-optimal solutions for large-scale instances of the problem. Numerical experiments based on practically generated instances with 300 time points and up to 100 vessels are conducted to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Results show that our method derives tight upper bounds on optimal solutions, and can quickly return good feasible solutions for the tested instances. We also conduct experiments based on realistic tracking data to demonstrate the usefulness of our solutions, including those for the cases considering the uncertainty of vessel locations.

Cooperative load transportation using multiple UAVs,"The aim of this paper is cooperative task assignment to multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for load transportation. The main goal is to transport a slung load safely with minimal swing. To this end, for each UAV, which is regarded as an agent, a distributed controller is proposed. The proposed controller guarantees a fixed formation, which in turn achieves the main objective. A model of the system is obtained using the Udwadia-Kalaba method for an arbitrary number of UAVs and one slung load with ropes. This method leads to a novel multi-agent system model with interactions between neighbor and non-neighbor agents. The control law is then proposed based on sub-optimal LQR-PID for the extended system. Simulation results are presented to verify the ability of the proposed method to keep the formation of the agents, and to guide the load in the desired direction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Two-time-scale control of a multirotor aircraft for suspended load transportation,"This paper presents a trajectory control strategy for a multirotor aircraft carrying a suspended load. The load is modeled as a pendulum connected by a rigid link to the center of gravity of the vehicle. Starting from the dynamic equations describing the motion of the coupled vehicle slung-load systems, a nonlinear controller is proposed that simultaneously performs trajectory tracking and payload swing damping. Controller gains are chosen so that the system exhibits a two-time-scale behavior, with fast dynamics for the pendulum and slow dynamics for the positioning task. Under these conditions, the basic results of singular perturbation theory are evoked for both the proof of stability and the preliminary design of control gains. Results of numerical simulations are provided in order to assess the stability and performance of the considered approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Persistent standoff tracking guidance using constrained particle filter for multiple UAVs,"This paper presents a new standoff tracking framework of a moving ground target using UAVs with limited sensing capabilities and motion constraints. To maintain persistent track of the target even in case of target loss for a certain period, this study predicts the target existence area using the particle filter and produces control commands that ensure that all predicted particles can stay within the field-of-view of the UAV sensor at all times. To improve target position prediction and estimation accuracy, the road information is incorporated into the constrained particle filter where the road boundaries are modelled as inequality constraints. Both Lyapunov vector field guidance and nonlinear model predictive control-based methods are applied, and the characteristics of them are compared using numerical simulations.

Adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control of 6-DOF nonlinear and uncertain air vehicle,"In this paper, to control the six degree-of-freedom non-linear unmanned aerial vehicle, two strategies are implemented using adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control approach. The first one is a single-channel controller that is designed on the basis of decoupled equations of motion. The other one is a three-channel controller that is designed based on the coupling equations of motion along with an adaptive super-twisting observer. The stability of the closed loop system of the controller-observer is proven. The comparison between the single-channel controller and the three-channel could lead us to select between a little lower efficiency and less complexity versus efficiency and more complexity. To examine the performance and robustness of these two control loops, their performances are analyzed in the presence of combined uncertainties, including aerodynamics, mass, inertial moment, sensor, and actuator disturbances and parametric uncertainties in the stage separation phase. The explosive bolt separation mechanism is assumed to perform the stage separation, and its forces, moments and disturbances are modeled as needed. Finally, the responses are compared with the classic PID controller. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Drone,2019
Time-optimal trajectory generation for aerial coverage of urban building,"This paper presents a hierarchical architecture for generating the cooperative trajectories of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) attached with camera sensors, which aim to cover buildings with optimal time in 3D urban environment. It incorporates the centralized high-level layer performing the mission analysis and task allocation functions yielding instructions that are transmitted to the UAVs, as well as the decentralized low-level fashion that the UAVs perform the trajectory generation function in turn. First, the mission features especially the theoretical coverage time of building envelope are extracted quantitatively, and the buildings are then allocated to the UAVs in order to convert the cooperative control problem into multiple single-vehicle control problems. Then, each UAV visits and scans its allocated buildings sequentially, and the corresponding coverage trajectories are obtained by the parallel circle strategy (PCS) and the time-optimal guidance vector field (TOGVF) transition method, as well as the interfered fluid dynamic system (IFDS) method for obstacle avoidance. Finally, our proposed method is verified in various scenarios, and the simulation results show its high efficiency with least time to solve the cooperative coverage problem.

UAV aerodynamic design involving genetic algorithm and artificial neural network for wing preliminary computation,"In this paper, the aerodynamic design procedure of a mini unmanned aerial vehicle, intended to perform aerial reconnaissance at low altitude and low Reynolds number, was summarized. Design process was divided into two major parts: conceptual design phase and preliminary design phase. During the conceptual design, classical procedures and data from similar unmanned aerial vehicles already designed were employed to define the requirements related to unmanned aerial vehicle design. The preliminary design was performed using panel method where the emphasis was given on the design of the UAV wing, fuselage design and empennage. The wing planform parameters were determined through an aerodynamic optimization process using both genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks. Finally an aerodynamic analysis using panel method, Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations and wind tunnel testing was carried out. Unmanned aerial vehicle full configuration design process was consistent, where a comparison between the final obtained results was carried out and showed an agreement in terms of lift, drag and pitch moment coefficients.

Attitude estimation for cooperating UAVs based on tight integration of GNSS and vision measurements,"This paper presents a cooperative navigation approach for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allows robust and accurate attitude determination for a chief vehicle flying in formation with other deputy UAVs. The proposed method is based on a tightly coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that exploits the spatial diversity of measurements coming from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers and a vision system, which are integrated with inertial and magnetic sensor data. The focus is set on outdoor environments and the innovative idea is to extend attitude estimation approaches based on multiple GNSS antennas, to a multi-vehicle system where differential-GNSS and vision-based UAV-to-UAV tracking are exploited to build a virtual additional navigation sensor. Concept and processing architecture are described with emphasis on the EKF measurement update phase which is applicable for any number of cooperating deputies, and for different GNSS processing architectures. Performance of the proposed method is assessed through experimental tests involving two multi-rotors and two fixed ground antennas, one of which is used as Ground Control Point for pointing accuracy analysis. Results show the potential of the developed approach in terms of accuracy and capability to provide drift-free estimates, in real time or in post processing scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Experimental Design of a Mobile Landing Platform to Assist Aerial Surveys in Fluvial Environments,"Sampling aquatic ecosystems is a laborious and expensive task, especially when covering large areas. This can be improved using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various remote sensing sensors. However, the UAV performance and autonomy may vary due to external factors when it is operated outdoors. In some cases, an emergency landing maneuver is necessary to avoid an accident, since in fluvial environments, the UAV control landing becomes a difficult operation. Therefore, it is important to have a backup platform on the water to fix this problem. This paper presents the design and development of a custom-built unmanned surface vehicle using open-source tools and with two types of operation-remotely piloted and autonomous-to support remote sensing practices with UAVs in fluvial environments. Finally, part of the software developed within this project was released in an open-source repository.",Drone,2019
Visual-Based Positioning of Aerial Maintenance Platforms on Overhead Transmission Lines,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are an emerging and promising alternative for monitoring of transmission lines in terms of flexibility, complexity, working speed, and cost. One of the main challenges is to enable UAVs to become as autonomous as possible. A vital component toward this direction is the robust and accurate estimation of the UAV placement with respect to the transmission grid. This work faces this challenge by developing a transmission line autonomous tracking system, which allows the placement of a commercial drone over a transmission grid using a monocular camera. This feature provides accurate positioning for the vehicle even where the Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal is denied, enabling to report the status of transmission lines, at any time. The system isolates transmission grid conductors in each acquired RGB-image using an image-processing algorithm based on Hough transform, morphological operations, and Gabor filters. With this information, the system computes the location of the UAV using a geometric approach that relates transmission lines building parameter and optical geometry. However, it has the problem of gradual error accumulation when the drone moves. In this regards, the estimated position of the drone is computed by the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by the position information estimated by visual-system, the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and GNSS. The proposed positioning system showed an efficiency of 91.44% in field experimentation in the extraction of transmission conductor, with a root mean square the error of 0.18 m in the UAV localization.",Drone,2019
Cyclical NOMA Based UAV-Enabled Wireless Network,"In order to achieve high spectral efficiency and low access delay, this paper introduces cyclical non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless network. It allows the UAV to communicate with multiple ground users in the same time-frequency resources, cyclically. The minimum throughput over all ground users is maximized by jointly optimizing multiuser communication scheduling with cyclical NOMA and UAV trajectory. It turns out that the maximization of minimum throughput is a mixed integer non-linear non-convex optimization problem. In this paper, this problem is decoupled into two blocks, i.e., the optimization of multiuser communication scheduling with cyclical NOMA and the optimization of UAV trajectory. Then, a joint optimization algorithm is proposed based on the block coordinate descent method. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization method can double the minimum throughput, compared with cyclical TDMA. In addition, it reduces users' average access delay and UAV's flying range under the same minimum throughput.",Drone,2019
Radio Channel Characterization of Mid-Band 5G Service Delivery for Ultra-Low Altitude Aerial Base Stations,"This paper presents a study which evaluated the potential for using ultra-low altitude, unmanned aerial vehicles to deliver fifth-generation (5G) cellular connectivity, particularly into areas requiring short-term enhancement in coverage. Such short-term enhancement requirements may include large gatherings of people or during disaster scenarios where there may be service outages or a need for increased bandwidth. An evaluation of this approach was conducted with empirically generated results regarding signal quality and cellular coverage-illustrating the potential of using unmanned ultra-low altitude aerial vehicles to deliver 5G cellular mobile services. Specifically, channel gain, mean time delay of the received signals (tau(mean)), and the root-mean-square spread of the delay (tau(rms)) were investigated for two distinct user modes at three different drone heights for three selected environments-an open area (field), a tree-lined environment, and an enclosed area. Maximum likelihood estimates for the various drone heights, user modes, and operational environments were found to be Rician distributed for the received signal strength measurements, whereas tau(mean) and tau(rms) for the open and tree-lined environments were Weibull distributed with the enclosed area tests being lognormally distributed. The paper also investigates how the channel gain may be affected when operating in each of the various global bands allocated for mid-5G communications, namely, Europe, China, Japan, South Korea, and North America. These regional mid-5G band allocations were found to yield minimal variance for all the environments considered.",Drone,2019
Full State Tracking and Formation Control for Under-Actuated VTOL UAVs,"In this paper, a coupled-attitude based trajectory tracking scheme is proposed to track both the position and attitude of under-actuated unmanned aerial vehicles, and its application on formation control is further demonstrated. An intermediate attitude which is composed of the desired attitude and position information is designed in a two-stage framework, wherein the first stage is the controller design of a translational subsystem and the second stage is that of an attitude subsystem. By virtue of the intermediate attitude, trajectory tracking which includes both attitude and position is realized. The proposed intermediate attitude can be viewed as a bridge connecting the position and attitude motion, and it is a new approach for both single and multiple under-actuated rigid bodies' control. Based on the approach of coupled-attitude-based trajectory tracking, both the set point stabilization and formation tracking tasks for under-actuated vertical takeoff and landing vehicles over a directed acyclic graph can be achieved. The performances of the proposed control laws are illustrated through numerical simulations.",Drone,2019
Theory and Experiment on Formation-Containment Control of Multiple Multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems,"Formation-containment control problems for multiple multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with directed topologies are studied, where the states of leaders form desired formation and the states of followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. First, formation-containment protocols are constructed based on the neighboring information of UAVs. Then, sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems to achieve formation-containment are presented. An explicit expression to describe the relationship among the states of followers, the time-varying formation for the leaders and the formation reference is derived. It is shown that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. Moreover, an approach to determine the gain matrices of the formation-containment protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Finally, a formation-containment platform with five quadrotor UAVs is introduced, and both the simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.Note to Practitioners-This paper addresses the problem of formation-containment control for multi-UAV systems over directed topologies. In practical applications, there may exist multiple leaders and multiple followers in a multi-UAV system. Formation-containment means that the states of leaders form the desired time-varying formation and at the same time the states of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders. Formation-containment control provides a unified framework for formation control and containment control, and has potential applications in the cooperative source seeking, load transportation, and surveillance. Although formation control and containment control problems have been studied a lot, the formation-containment control problem for multi-UAV system is still open and challenging. This paper proposed a distributed formation-containment protocol for the multi-UAV system using local neighboring information. Sufficient conditions for multi-UAV systems to achieve formation-containment are presented. It is proven that the states of followers not only converge to the convex hull formed by those of leaders but also keep certain formation specified by the convex combination of the formation for the leaders. An approach to design the formation-containment protocol is given. A remarkable point for this paper is that the obtained results are demonstrated by practical experiments with five quadrotor UAVs.",Drone,2019
A New Passive 3-D Automatic Target Recognition Architecture for Aerial Platforms,"The 3-D automatic target recognition (ATR) has many advantages over its 2-D counterpart, but there are several constraints in the context of small low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These limitations include the requirement for active rather than passive monitoring, high equipment costs, sensor packaging size, and processing burden. We, therefore, propose a new structure from motion (SfM) 3-D ATR architecture that exploits the UAV's onboard sensors, i.e., the visual band camera, gyroscope, and accelerometer, and meets the requirements of a small LTAV system. We tested the proposed 3-D SfM ATR using simulated UAV reconnaissance scenarios and found that the performance was better than classic 3-D light detection and ranging (LIDAR) ATR, combining the advantages of 3-D LIDAR ATR and passive 2-D ATR. The main advantages of the proposed architecture include the rapid processing, target pose invariance, small template size, passive scene sensing, and inexpensive equipment. We implemented the StM module under two keypoint detection, description and matching schemes, with the 3-D ATR module exploiting several current techniques. By comparing SfM 3-D ATR, 3-D LIDAR ATR, and 2-D ATR, we confirmed the superior performance of our new architecture.",Drone,2019
Nonlinear High-Gain Observer-Based Diagnosis and Compensation for Actuator and Sensor Faults in a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"This paper studies the diagnosis and compensation for sensor and actuator faults in a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle. Without adding sensors or actuators for increased hardware redundancy, an observer-based adaptive controller is proposed to estimate and compensate for the faults. First, using a feedback linearization technique, an inner controller is designed to transform the form of the considered quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle with faults into a nonlinear system with Lipschitz-like nonlinearities and parametric faulty models. Second, the estimations for unmeasurable state and actuator faults are performed in an output-feedback outer controller to compensate for the actuator faults. Third, a nonlinear high-gain observer is designed to provide the information of the state and faults to the outer controller, with the compensations for sensor faults. A Lyapunov-based analysis shows that appropriate choices of the controller parameters can guarantee the exponential convergence of errors in estimation and trajectory tracking under uncertainties and faults. The robustness to the external disturbances is also discussed. Simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The proposed approach is also implemented on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle to show its feasibility in real-time applications.",Drone,2019
Development of a Wall-Climbing Drone Capable of Vertical Soft Landing Using a Tilt-Rotor Mechanism,"Wall-climbing drones have many applications, including structural health monitoring of civil structures, such as bridges and high-rise buildings, cleaning of solar panels to improve power generation efficiency, and airplane visual inspections. For these applications, the drone requires a high-payload capacity, and consequently the size and weight of the drone increase. The drone also should not damage the target structures considering the purpose of its mission. Our previous versions of a wall-climbing drone could have high-impact force on the surface where the drone perches and on the platform itself because of the impact caused by a fast pose change and landing speed. In order to overcome this potential risk, a mechanism and a control algorithm for perching on a vertical surface through low-speed pose change are proposed in this paper. The drone platform is based on an X-configuration quadcopter, and a tilt-rotor mechanism is incorporated into the two axes, such that the front thrusters and the rear thrusters are paired. The vertical soft landing mechanism using the tilt-rotors is validated by the experimental tests of the prototype.",Drone,2019
Finite-Time Formation Control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarm System With Time-Delay and Input Saturation,"This paper deals with finite-time formation control problems of unmanned aerial vehicle swarm system with time-delay and input saturation. Using precise feedback linearization, first, the nonlinear time-delay model of unmanned aerial vehicle is transformed into a linear second-order time-delay system. Based on the neighbors' states, a fixed-time distributed observer is constructed to estimate the leader's state for each follower unmanned aerial vehicle quickly and accurately. Moreover, by utilizing Artstein's transformation, the delayed second-order system is transformed into a delay-free system and a saturation function is used to tackle the input saturation problem. Then, a finite-time formation control protocol is designed based on the Artstein's transformation and saturation function. Rigorous proof shows that all control inputs are bounded and the formation control with time-delay is achieved in finite time. Finally, a simulation example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",Drone,2019
UAV Hovering Strategy Based on a Wirelessly Powered Communication Network,"With the development of wireless power transfer technology, wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), which can provide a sustainable energy supply for the user equipment, have received extensive attention from researchers. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based WPCN (U-WPCN) can effectively solve the problems of energy shortage and weak signal strength for ground terminals in remote areas. To establish a highly efficient U-WPCN, the service area for each UAV platform should be determined such that each UAV platform will hover at the optimal position according to the locations of the ground terminals in its group. Through hovering position optimization, this paper proposes two networking strategies for improving networking efficiency and maximizing communication performance. A greedy algorithm is used to find the optimal hovering point for each area; thus, the hovering points of all UAVs in the U-WPCN are finally obtained. Simulation results show that the UAV utilization efficiency can be significantly increased through the economical mode, and the terminal transmission rates can be improved for a given number of drones in the performance mode.",Drone,2019
Distributed finite-time tracking control for multiple uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems with input saturations and error constraints,"This study addresses the distributed finite-time tracking control for multiple uncertain Euler-Lagrange systems with input saturations and error constraints. In order to achieve distributed finite-time tracking control in the model-independent way, neural networks are used to approximate the system unknown terms. Besides, the authors consider that there exists input saturation for each dimension of each follower in the systems. The input saturations are tackled by converting the systems with input saturations to the cases with unknown input gains. Then, based on backstepping technique, the distributed finite-time tracking control law is developed. Tan-type barrier Lyapunov function is utilised to guarantee that the error variables would not exceed the predefined bounds. Lyapunov theory and graph theory demonstrate the finite-time stability of the systems. By choosing a class of two-link manipulators consisting of one leader and four followers, numerical simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.",Drone,2019
An Improved Model Combining Evolutionary Algorithm and Neural Networks for PV Maximum Power Point Tracking,"Aiming at the large error of the traditional constant control method in predicting the maximum power of solar UAV, this paper proposed an improved mind evolutionary algorithm combined with BP neural network (BPNN), in which the improved mind evolutionary algorithm optimizes the BPNN. The optimized model is used to predict the voltage at the maximum power of the panel in the UAV. The constant voltage parameter based on the conventional constant pressure control algorithm is replaced by this value. At the same time, a new control simulation model of constant voltage solar panel maximum power tracking based on the improved mind evolution algorithm optimize BPNN was built. At last, the algorithm was simulated and validated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The simulation results show that this algorithm is better than simply using BPNN and genetic algorithm optimize BPNN stability and higher accuracy.",Drone,2019
Decentralized Real-Time Estimation and Tracking for Unknown Ground Moving Target Using UAVs,"This paper presents a decentralized cooperative tracking strategy based on information filtering with consensus analysis and model predictive control (MPC) for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), tracking unknown ground moving target. For unknown target, squared-root cubature information filtering (SCIF) is designed to estimate the target states based on the measurement from the onboard sensor at each UAV. To eliminate the difference between estimations of UAVs, the consensus algorithm, hybrid consensus on measurement-consensus on information is applied for more accurate estimation of target. A fast MPC method is introduced to obtain the UAVs' path, where collision avoidance between UAVs and the change of communication topology among UAVs are taken into account. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Drone,2019
Wide-Area Vehicle-Drone Cooperative Sensing:Opportunities and Approaches,"The last decade has witnessed unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) emerging as a powerful platform for various industrial and civilian applications. However, refrained by limited battery capacities, the hovering time of UAVs is still limited, impeding them from achieving remote tasks, such as wide area inspection. To deal with such long-range applications, a common sense solution is to employ vehicles to transport, launch, and recycle UAVs. Efficient routing and scheduling for UAVs and vehicles can greatly reduce time consumption and financial expenses incurred in long-range inspection. Nevertheless, prior works in vehicle-assisted UAV inspection considered only one UAV, and was incapable of concurrently serving multiple targets distributed in an area. Leveraging multiple UAVs to serve multiple targets in parallel can significantly enhance efficiency and expand service areas. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA), which supports the cooperation of one vehicle and multiple drones for wide area inspection applications. HGA allows multiple UAVs to launch and recycle in different locations, minimizing time wastage for both the vehicle and UAVs. Performance evaluation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm when compared with existing solutions.",Drone,2019
Structure from motion for ordered and unordered image sets based on random k-d forests and global pose estimation,"In this paper, we present a new fast and robust method for structure from motion (SfM) for data sets potentially comprising thousands of ordered or unordered images. Our work focuses on the two most time-consuming procedures: (a) image matching and (b) pose estimation. For image matching, a new method employing a random k-d forest is proposed to quickly obtain pairs of overlapping images from an unordered set. After that, image matching and the estimation of relative orientation parameters are performed only for pairs found to be very likely to overlap. For pose estimation, we use a two-stage global approach, separating the determination of rotation matrices and translation parameters; the latter are computed simultaneously using a new method. In order to cope with outliers in the relative orientations, which global approaches are particularly sensitive to, we present a new constraint based on triplet loop closure errors of rotation and translation. Finally, a robust bundle adjustment is carried out to refine the image orientation parameters.We demonstrate the potential and limitations of our pipeline using various real-world datasets including ordered image data acquired from UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and other platforms as well as unordered data from the internet. The experiments show that our work performs better than comparable state-of-the-art SfM systems in terms of run time, while we achieve a similar accuracy and robustness.",Drone,2019
Generating a hyperspectral digital surface model using a hyperspectral 2D frame camera,"Miniaturised 2D frame format hyperspectral camera technology that is suitable for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has entered the market, making the generation of hyperspectral digital surface models (HDSMs) feasible. HDSMs offer a rigorous approach to capturing the target spectral and 3D geometric data. The main objective of this investigation was to study and develop techniques for the generation of HDSMs in forest areas using novel hyperspectral 2D frame camera technologies. An approach based on object-space image matching was developed, adapting the traditional vertical line locus (VLL) method for HDSM generation; this was then named the hyperspectral VLL (HVLL) approach. Additionally, image classification was introduced into the processing chain in order to adapt the matching parameters, based on different classes. We also proposed a method for extracting the spectral and viewing angle information of the points. An empirical study was carried out using UAV datasets from tropical and boreal forests using 2D format hyperspectral cameras, based on tuneable Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) technology. Quality assessment was performed using DSMs based on state-of-the-art commercial software and airborne laser scanning (ALS). The results showed that the proposed technique generated a high-quality HDSM in both tested environments. The HDSM had higher deviations over the continuous canopy cover than the digital surface models (DSMs) generated using commercial software. The method using image classification information outperformed the commercial approach with respect to the ability to measure ground points in shadowed areas and in canopy gaps. The proposed method is of great interest in supporting automated interpretations of novel multi- and hyperspectral imaging technologies, especially when applied complex objects, such as forests.",Drone,2019
Coordinated trajectory tracking of multiple vertical take-off and landing UAVs,"This paper investigates the coordinated trajectory tracking problem of multiple vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The case of unidirectional information flow is considered and the objective is to drive all the follower VTOL UAVs to accurately track a desired trajectory associated with a leader. Firstly, a novel distributed estimator is developed for each VTOL UAV to obtain the leader's desired information asymptotically. With the outputs of the estimators, the solution to the coordinated trajectory tracking problem of multiple VTOL UAVs is transformed to individually solving the tracking problem of each VTOL UAV. Due to the under-actuated nature of the VTOL UAV, a hierarchical framework is introduced for each VTOL UAV such that a command force and an applied torque are exploited in sequence, then the position tracking to the estimated desired position and the attitude tracking to the command attitude are achieved. Moreover, an auxiliary system with proper parameters is implemented to guarantee the singularity-free command attitude extraction and to obviate the use of the unavailable desired information. The stability analysis and simulations effectively validate the achievement of the coordinated trajectory tracking of multiple VTOL UAVs with the proposed control approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A distributed PSO-based exploration algorithm for a UAV network assisting a disaster scenario,"UAV networks have been in the spotlight of the research community on the last decade. One of the civil applications in which UAV networks may have more potential is in emergency response operations. Having a UAV network that is able to deploy autonomously and provide communication services in a disaster scenario would be very helpful for both victims and first responders. However, generating exploratory trajectories for these networks is one of the main issues when dealing with complex scenarios. We propose an algorithm based on the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, in which the UAV team follows the networking approach known as Delay Tolerant Network. We pursue two main goals, the first is exploring a disaster scenario area, and the second is making the UAVs converge to several victims groups discovered during the exploration phase. We have run extensive simulations for performing a characterization of the proposed algorithm. Both goals of the mission are successfully achieved with the proposed algorithm. Besides, in comparison to an optimal trajectory planning algorithm that sweeps the entire disaster scenario, our algorithm is able to discover faster the 25%, 50% and 75% of the scenario victims and it converges faster. In addition, in terms of connections events between a victim and a UAV, our algorithm shows more frequent connections and less time between consecutive connections. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A Survey on Cluster-Based Routing Protocols for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Networks,"In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained popularity for various applications and services in both the military and civilian domains. Multiple UAVs can carry out complex tasks efficiently when they are organized as an ad hoc network, where wireless communication is essential for cooperation and collaboration between UAVs and the ground station. Due to rapid mobility and highly dynamic topology, designing a routing protocol for UAV networks is a challenging task. As the number of UAVs increases, a hierarchical routing called clustering is necessarily required to provide scalability because clustering schemes ensure the basic level of system performance such as throughput, end-to-end delay, and energy efficiency. For approximately a half-decade, several survey articles have been reported on topology-based routing and position-based routing for UAV networks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, however, there is no survey on cluster-based routing in the literature. In this paper, cluster-based routing protocols for UAV networks are extensively surveyed and qualitatively compared in terms of outstanding features, characteristics, competitive advantages, and limitations. Furthermore, open research issues and challenges on cluster-based routing are discussed.",Drone,2019
Relative Heading Estimation and Its Application in Target Handoff in GPS-Denied Environments,"In this paper, we address the problem of target handoff between two fixed wing aircrafts that do not have access to Global Positioning Systems. The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We assume that onboard inertial measurement units can provide roll and pitch estimates of the aircraft attitude. We examine the observability of other relative states needed to do the handoff problem. In particular, we consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the relative position between the aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircrafts do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircrafts is observable. In the second scenario, we assume that only the bearing angle between the two aircrafts is measured, as would be the case for a vision sensor. We prove state observability for maneuvers that are relevant to target tracking and handoff. We also present an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters to estimate the relative states. Simulation results with full vehicle dynamics demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",Drone,2019
Robustness Analysis of Flight Controllers for Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aircraft Systems Using Integral Quadratic Constraints,"A robust analysis framework for mathematical validation of flight control systems is presented. The framework is specifically developed for the complete uncertainty characterization, quantification, and analysis of small fixed-wing unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The analytical approach presented within is based on integral quadratic constraint (IQC) analysis and uses linear fractional transformations on uncertainties to represent system models. While IQC analysis has a sound theoretical foundation, there remains a lack of literature on applying IQCs to complex engineering systems and evaluating their effectiveness with physical data. One difficulty lies in appropriately characterizing and quantifying the uncertainties such that the resulting uncertain model is representative of the physical system while forming a computationally tractable problem that is not overly conservative. This paper addresses these challenges by applying IQC analysis tools to analyze the robustness of a UAS flight control system. Uncertainties are characterized and quantified based on mathematical models and flight test data obtained in-house for a small commercial off-the-shelf platform with a custom autopilot. Furthermore, an established gradient-based minimization routine is implemented with IQC analysis to demonstrate how IQC analysis can guide the control design process. This approach also reveals the controlled system's sensitivities to uncertainties, thereby assisting the designer in determining how much uncertainty allowance ought to exist in certain aspects of the UAS. Finally, these methods are tested in physical flight to showcase the effectiveness of IQC analysis and assess the conservativeness of the approach. The proposed framework is also transferable to other fixed-wing UAS platforms, effectively taking IQC analysis beyond academic examples to practical application in UAS system design, control design, and airworthiness certification.",Drone,2019
Distributed Optimization for Multiagent Systems: An Edge-Based Fixed-Time Consensus Approach,"This paper deals with the problem of distributed optimization for multiagent systems by using an edge-based fixed-time consensus approach. In the case of time-invariant cost functions, a new distributed protocol is proposed to achieve the state agreement in a fixed time while the sum of local convex functions known to individual agents is minimized. In the case of time-varying cost functions, based on the new distributed protocol in the case of time-invariant cost functions, a distributed protocol is provided by taking the Hessian matrix into account. In both cases, stability conditions are derived to ensure that the distributed optimization problem is solved under both fixed and switching communication topologies. A distinctive feature of the results in this paper is that an upper bound of settling time for consensus can be estimated without dependence on initial states of agents, and thus can be made arbitrarily small through adjusting system parameters. Therefore, the results in this paper can be applicable in an unknown environment such as drone rendezvous within a required time for military purpose while optimizing local objectives. Case studies of a power output agreement for battery packages are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.",Drone,2019
Real-Time Traffic Flow Parameter Estimation From UAV Video Based on Ensemble Classifier and Optical Flow,"Recently, the availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) opens up new opportunities for smart transportation applications, such as automatic traffic data collection. In such a trend, detecting vehicles and extracting traffic parameters from UAV video in a fast and accurate manner is becoming crucial in many prospective applications. However, from the methodological perspective, several limitations have to be addressed before the actual implementation of UAV. This paper proposes a new and complete analysis framework for traffic flow parameter estimation from UAV video. This framework addresses the well-concerned issues on UAV's irregular ego-motion, low estimation accuracy in dense traffic situation, and high computational complexity by designing and integrating four stages. In the first two stages an ensemble classifier (Haar cascade + convolutional neural network) is developed for vehicle detection, and in the last two stages a robust traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on optical flow and traffic flow theory. The proposed ensemble classifier is demonstrated to outperform the state-of-the-art vehicle detectors that designed for UAV-based vehicle detection. Traffic flow parameter estimations in both free flow and congested traffic conditions are evaluated, and the results turn out to be very encouraging.

Transient Performance of Separated Flows: Characterization and Active Flow Control,"The aerothermal performance of the low-pressure turbine in unmanned aerial vehicles is significantly abated at high altitude, due to boundary layer separation. Different flow control strategies have been proposed to prevent boundary layer separation, such as dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) and synthetic jets. However, the optimization of the control approach requires a better characterization of the separated regions at transient conditions. The present investigation analyzes the behavior of separated flows, reporting the inception and separation length, allowing the development of efficient flow control methods under nontemporally uniform inlet conditions. The development of separated flows was investigated with numerical simulations including Unsteady Reynolds average Navier-Stokes (URANS) and large Eddy simulations (LES). The present research was performed on a wall-mounted hump, which imposes a pressure gradient representative of the suction side of low pressure turbines. Through sudden flow accelerations, we looked into the dynamic response of the shear layer detachment as it is modulated by the mean flow evolution. Similarly, we studied the behavior of the recirculation bubble under periodic disturbances imposed at various frequencies ranging from 10 to 500 Hz, at which the Reynolds number oscillates between 40,000 and 180,000. As a first step into the flow control, we added a slot to allow flow injection and ingestion upstream of the separation inception. Exploring the behavior of the separated region at different conditions, we defined the envelope for its periodic actuation. We found that by matching the actuator frequency with the frequency response of the separated region, the performance of the actuation is boosted.",Drone,2019
Influence of Unsteady and Kinematic Parameters on Aerodynamic Characteristics of a Pitching Airfoil,"Most unmanned aerial vehicles which fly with moving wings or encounter gusts at low Reynolds number conditions make pitching oscillation motions. The aerodynamic forces and flow field around the wings vary dramatically with the unsteady motion parameters (reduced frequency, mean angle of attack, and amplitude). This study conducts numerical simulations to investigate the influence of such parameters on the aerodynamic characteristics of a pitching NACA 0012 airfoil. The respective cases are researched through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the finite-volume method (FVM). The governing equations are the unsteady, incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations. The airfoil performs sinusoidal pitching oscillations with respect to the quarter chord at the Reynolds number 2.53x105. A detailed analysis of the force coefficients and how their evolution is affected by the dynamics of flow structures generated during pitch oscillations is presented. The results show that these parameters change the instantaneous force coefficients quantitatively and qualitatively. The effective angle of attack is different at various locations of the airfoil chord during the oscillation motion, which determines the deviations of forces at the same angle of attack during pitch-up and pitch-down periods. It is also observed that the strength, interaction, and convection of the vortex surrounding the airfoil are significantly affected by the variations of these parameters.

A hybridization of extended Kalman filter and Ant Colony Optimization for state estimation of nonlinear systems,"In this paper, a new nonlinear heuristic filter based on the hybridization of an extended Kalman filter and an ant colony estimator is proposed to estimate the states of a nonlinear system. In this filter, a group of virtual ants searches the state space stochastically and dynamically to find and track the best state estimation while the position of each ant is updated at the measurement time using the extended Kalman filter. The performance of the proposed filter is compared with well-known heuristic filters using a nonlinear benchmark problem. The statistical results show that this algorithm is able to provide promising and competitive results. Then, the new filter is tested on a nonlinear engineering problem with more than one state. The problem is to estimate simultaneously the states of an unmanned aerial vehicle as well as the wind disturbances, applied to the system. In this case, a processor-in-the-loop experiment is also performed to verify the implementation capability of the proposed approach. This paper also investigates the real-time implementation capability of the proposed filter in the attitude estimation of a three degrees of freedom experimental setup of a quadrotor to further investigate its effectiveness in practice.

An efficient metamodel-based multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization framework,"This paper presents an efficient metamodel-based multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) architecture for solving multi-objective high fidelity MDO problems. One of the important features of the proposed method is the development of an efficient surrogate model-based multi-objective particle swarm optimization (EMOPSO) algorithm, which is integrated with a computationally efficient metamodel-based MDO architecture. The proposed EMOPSO algorithm is based on sorted Pareto front crowding distance, utilizing star topology. In addition, a constraint-handling mechanism in non-domination appointment and fuzzy logic is also introduced to overcome feasibility complexity and rapid identification of optimum design point on the Pareto front. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a metamodel-based collaborative optimization architecture. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with existing multi-objective optimization algorithms such as multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), using a number of well-known benchmark problems. One of the important results observed is that the proposed EMOPSO algorithm provides high diversity with fast convergence speed as compared to other algorithms. The proposed method is also applied to a multi-objective collaborative optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle wing based on high fidelity models involving structures and aerodynamics disciplines. The results obtained show that the proposed method provides an effective way of solving multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization problem using high fidelity models.

Docking navigation method for UAV autonomous aerial refueling,"In this paper, a docking navigation method for autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based on a binocular vision system (BVS) is proposed. A BVS simulation platform is built for simulation research purposes. First, unnecessary scene information in the image is filtered through green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and filters. Then the image is processed via graying, binarization, and median filtering to highlight the connected area of the LED in the image. Subsequently, the center of mass of the connected area is selected as the feature point (FP), and the FPs are described using an improved Haar wavelet transform. The multidimensional description vector of FP is obtained and matched. Finally, the position and pose of the refueling cone sleeve are estimated. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the presented AAR navigation method.",Drone,2019
VISION SYSTEM SUPPORTING THE PILOT IN VARIABLE LIGHT CONDITIONS,"The aim of this study is to demonstrate the applicability of contemporary optoelectronic systems supported by image processing algorithms in aviation. Optoelectronic systems can support the pilot's work or the work of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operator after being installed in the cockpit of the pilot or in a ground station. The origin of the problem is related to the aspects of safe operation of the aircraft in the conditions of dynamically, changing ambient light observed by the aircraft pilot or operator monitoring the monitor at the ground station and observing the image from the camera installed on the UAV The proposed solution is to help avoid situations in which the pilot's/operators situational awareness deteriorates due to strong optical phenomena.",Drone,2019
Design of rules for in-flight non-parametric tuning of PID controllers for unmanned aerial vehicles,"Designing high performance controllers for multirotors is a rigorous task that is often solved by trial and error approach. Trial and error tuning usually results in non-optimal controller parameters. Tuning controllers based on the existing quadrotor models would result in poor performance of quadrotors due to simplifications and inaccuracies in the underlying models. In this paper optimal tuning rules for quadrotor attitude dynamics are designed, which guarantees near-optimal performance and robustness. A single inflight run of the Modified Relay Feedback Test that takes only few seconds with guaranteed stability is enough to have near-optimal tuning of the controller. The designed tuning rule is tested experimentally in-flight on a custom-built quadrotor. The results showed significant advantages in performance and robustness due to the proposed approach.

The drone imprint: literature in the age of UAVs,"This article is composed of the schema of Barbara Harlow's final but unfinished book project, The Drone Imprint: literature in the age of UAVs. Harlow had drafted a proposal, given a version of it as the keynote address at the South Asian Literature Association meeting at the University of Texas, Austin in 2016, and taught many of the materials in it as an undergraduate studies signature course. This piece draws on her proposal, expands it with notes she made and parts of composed text for the talks, and attempts to flesh out and complete the citations. It reveals Harlow's ongoing commitment to thinking through the dialectical relationship of literary and cultural studies to both the political exigencies of the present and the long histories of Empire. The project is instructive in the ways that it concatenates an interdisciplinary archive - human rights reports, novels, films, diaries, law cases, journalism - to elucidate both what drone warfare is doing to problems of literary and cultural representation and how literary modes are being redeployed in the understanding of the phenomenology of the drone. The project explores with some alarm and outrage what drone warfare is doing to questions of accountability and impunity in international human rights law, 'kill lists' as part of US foreign policy, questions of citizenship, habeas corpus and due process in the compressions and attenuations of sovereignty that UAVs accentuate.",Drone,2019
A survey of automation-enabled human-in-the-loop systems for infrastructure visual inspection,"Routine inspection and maintenance are critical for the proper functioning of civil infrastructures such as bridges, pavements and underground structures. Civil infrastructures are being inspected less frequently because of the high cost and long duration of current inspection procedures. Furthermore, conventional inspection procedures often interrupt the routine functioning of the infrastructure, are inspector-dependent and expose the inspectors to complex and unsafe working environments. Visual inspection technologies play a crucial role in the inspection and maintenance of civil infrastructures. Automation-assisted technologies such as drones and underwater vehicles equipped with multiple imaging and sensing systems have been developed to address some of these issues with the conventional visual inspection processes. This paper reviews peer-reviewed research publications investigating automated visual inspection technologies following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Specifically, 53 publications satisfying a set of inclusion criteria were reviewed, its results highlighting the application domain, the level of autonomy of the automated systems, the sensor technologies used for the inspection process and navigation, the navigation and control technologies and the algorithms used. The review of the articles revealed that the data collected by automation is used to augment the qualitative assessment. Several types of algorithms such as target detection and image enhancing have been developed to reduce the inspector bias in these automated technologies. Path planning algorithms reduce the workload on the inspector by automating the navigation and control tasks. Remotely operated systems reduce the risk to the inspectors by minimizing their exposure to the inspection environment. However, only a limited number of studies investigated the human factors aspects of the automation -assisted inspection process. It is important to understand the cognitive, physical, and temporal demands these technologies place on inspectors to improve the design of systems assisting in the inspection process. Moreover, factors such as automation bias, trust in the system and communication between the automation and the operator need to be investigated. Furthermore, it is important to incorporate appropriate decision aids that support adequate situation awareness in the interface design. Based on these findings this review proposes directions for future research. This review concludes by highlighting the need for human-centered research to develop better solutions for infrastructure inspection problems.",Drone,2019
Framework for automated UAS-based structural condition assessment of bridges,This paper presents a coherent framework for automated unmanned aircraft system based inspections of large bridges to facilitate an automated condition assessment. Modern camera equipped unmanned aircraft systems are used to generate high-resolution digital image data of the structural surface. The flight path is automatically computed from a basic 3D model and ensures that the image set will satisfy defined quality parameters according to the desired information extraction. State-of-the-art photogrammetry and machine learning based feature detection methods are employed to automatically compute high-resolution geo-referenced 3D structural geometries and to identify typical damage patterns such as cracks. Further framework components dedicated to condition assessment allow the mapping of damages to structural parts and the calibration of mechanical numerical simulation models used to compute the internal structural demand under design loads. Data models are proposed that allow a consistent data storage and management to serve as a basis for all algorithmic components. The application of the framework to a large bridge structure showcases how the integration of digital systems and algorithms forms the basis for an intelligent and potentially autonomous safety assessment of very large infrastructures.,Drone,2019
Fast and Efficient Aerial Climbing of Vertical Surfaces Using Fixed-Wing UAVs,"We present improvements to Sherbrooke's multi-modal autonomous drone (S-MAD), a microspine-based perching fixed-wing UAV that enables thrust-assisted climbing along vertical surfaces. Aircraft models are used to predict the performance of various aerial climb regimes and to design a controller for wall distance tracking. It is found that fast, long, and vertical climbs are favorable. Both short and long vertical autonomous climb maneuvers are demonstrated on rough surfaces (e.g., brick, roofing shingles). Results show that the S-MAD compares favorably with existing climbers, reaching a specific resistance of 19 with a much faster vertical speed (i.e., 2 m/s). A reduction in S-MAD's aerodynamic drag and an improved motor efficiency could bring its specific resistance down to 7, at a vertical speed of 5 m/s.",Drone,2019
Resilient Active Target Tracking With Multiple Robots,"The problem of target tracking with multiple robots consists of actively planning the motion of the robots to track the targets. A major challenge for practical deployments is to make the robots resilient to failures. In particular, robots may be attacked in adversarial scenarios, or their sensors may fail or get occluded. In this letter, we introduce planning algorithms for multi-target tracking that are resilient to such failures. In general, resilient target tracking is computationally hard. Contrary to the case where there are no failures, no scalable approximation algorithms are known for resilient target tracking when the targets are indistinguishable, or unknown in number, or with unknown motion model. In this letter, we provide the first such algorithm, which also has the following properties: First, it achieves maximal resiliency, since the algorithm is valid for any number of failures. Second, it is scalable, as our algorithm terminates with the same running time as state-of-the-art algorithms for (non-resilient) target tracking. Third, it provides provable approximation bounds on the tracking performance, since our algorithm guarantees a solution that is guaranteed to he close to the optimal. We quantify our algorithm's approximation performance using a novel notion of curvature for monotone set functions subject to matroid constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through MAMAS and Gazebo simulations and a sensitivity analysis; we focus on scenarios that involve a known number of distinguishable targets.",Drone,2019
Minimum-Time Trajectory Planning Under Intermittent Measurements,"This letter focuses on finding robust paths for a robotic system by taking into account the state uncertainty and the probability of collision. We are interested in dealing with intermittent exteroceptive measurements (e.g., collected from vision). We assume that these cues provide reliable measurements that will update a state estimation algorithm wherever they are available. The planner has to manage two tasks: reaching the goal in a minimum time and collecting sufficient measurements to reach the goal state with a given confidence level. We present a robust perception-aware hi-directional A* planner for differentially flat systems such as a unicycle and a quadrotor UAV and use a derivative-free Kalman filter to approximate the belief dynamics in the flat space. We also propose an efficient way of ensuring continuity and feasibility by exploiting the convex-hull property of B-spline curves.",Drone,2019
Integrated Visual Servoing Solution to Quadrotor Stabilization and Attitude Estimation Using a Pan and Tilt Camera,"This paper presents an integrated visual servoing solution to the problem of quadrotor attitude estimation and stabilization based solely on image feedback from a pan and tilt camera and biased rate gyros. The solution comprises a control law for the quadrotor position and attitude, a control law for the pan and tilt camera platform, and an estimator for the vehicle attitude, whose interconnection stabilizes the quadrotor in hover above certain terrain landmarks. Lateral-longitudinal stabilization is achieved with a nested saturation control law by feedback of the image measurements, estimated attitude, and corrected angular velocity measurements and the vehicle is stabilized vertically by means of image feedback. Resorting to the input-to-state stability properties of the controllers, the quadrotor's position and attitude are shown to converge to the desired equilibrium point and, in the end, the interconnected system's closed loop is proven robust to observer estimation errors. Additionally, the pan and tilt camera is actively actuated to keep the relevant features visible in the image field of view for most operating conditions. The robustness and performance of the proposed control and estimation architecture is illustrated through both simulation and experimental results.",Drone,2019
Advanced Properties of Full-Duplex Radio for Securing Wireless Network,"This paper examines the role of full-duplex radio for securing wireless network from a new perspective. It first studies the secrecy capacity of two single-antenna full-duplex users against a multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve) who has the perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) from users to Eve. It is shown that if Eve uses a basic matched-filtering, the probability of zero secrecy (or outage) can be made small by a large jamming power from both users and a small gain of residual self-interference (RSI) power. But if Eve uses the optimal matched-filtering, the probability of outage grows rapidly as either the jamming power from the users increases or the number of antennas on Eve increases, regardless of the RSI gain. To prevent any Eve from obtaining its CSI, this paper then proposes a novel anti-eavesdropping channel estimation (ANECE) method, which allows users to obtain their own CSI while keeping all Eves in handicap. This method also prevents Eves from colluding with each other at any layer. The design of ideal pilots for ANECE for multiple multi-antenna users and multiple broadband multi-antenna users is discussed. It is also shown that the capacity of Eve with any number of antennas but without its CSI can be virtually eliminated over a time window corresponding to the number of antennas at the transmitter for each realization of the CSI.",Drone,2019
Firefly: Virtual Illumination Drones for Interactive Visualization,"Light specification in three dimensional scenes is a complex problem and several approaches have been presented that aim to automate this process. However, there are many scenarios where a static light setup is insufficient, as the scene content and camera position may change. Simultaneous manual control over the camera and light position imposes a high cognitive load on the user. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach for automatic scene illumination with Fireflies. Fireflies are intelligent virtual light drones that illuminate the scene by traveling on a closed path. The Firefly path automatically adapts to changes in the scene based on an outcome-oriented energy function. To achieve interactive performance, we employ a parallel rendering pipeline for the light path evaluations. We provide a catalog of energy functions for various application scenarios and discuss the applicability of our method on several examples.",Drone,2019
Search for targets in a risky environment using multi-objective optimisation,"This study develops an online unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path-planning strategy for autonomous search and localisation of targets in a risky environment that simultaneously optimises two objectives: (i) search and (ii) survival. The authors formulate two rewards (objective) functions corresponding to the two objectives and compute the Pareto front, formed by taking convex combinations of these rewards. In the extreme case of pure search, using entropy reduction as the reward, the trajectory of the UAV is reminiscent of a systematic search pattern. When combined with the survival objective, the search pattern appears more random, as the UAV intelligently trades off the reward of finding targets with the risk of being destroyed.",Drone,2019
Cooperative geometric localization for a ground target based on the relative distances by multiple UAVs,"Based on the locations of several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their relative distances from a target, a ground target cooperative geometric localization method that is more effective than a traditional approach is proposed in this paper. First, an algorithm for determining the location of the target is described. The effectiveness and suitability of the proposed algorithm are then shown. Next, to investigate the location accuracy of the proposed method, the influence of three critical factors, namely, the flight altitude, UAV position errors, and measurement errors, is analyzed. Furthermore, for the required location accuracy, the feasible regions of these factors are determined based on their influence, and the location accuracy will satisfy the requirements if all factors are within the feasible regions. Finally, simulation results from the MATLAB/Simulink toolbox are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method and the availability of the feasible regions.",Drone,2019
Determination of coordinates of sources of pulse radio signals using Time Difference of Arrival method with one flying receiving point,"The article proposes an approach aimed on determining the coordinates of pulsed radio signal sources on the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) basis. The main difference from known methods, that are based on finding the time delay by measuring the difference in the arrival time of relayed signals from two or more peripheral receiving points, the proposed one allows you to find coordinate-informative parameter (KIP) without relaying the signal and in conditions of using one receiving point - an unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with radio-frequency equipment (hereinafter UAV - sensor). The idea of reducing the number of receiving points in the implementation of TDOA to one UAV sensor is based on the use of the modes features of some pulse radio signals sources, namely the formation of a pulse signal with a constant pulse repetition period for a certain period of time. The main stages of finding the time delay by one UAV sensor include the stage of forming a grid of time stamps, the stage of forming final samples of signal-noise structures and the stage of the evaluation values of the coordinate-informative parameters. The basis of the time stamp grid generation phase includes four sequentially performed steps: pulse normalization and setting the detection threshold; measurement of the pulse start time; calculation of a grid of time stamps; setting an interrupt timer based on the quantum frequency standard. The stage of forming of final samplings includes recording in-phase and quadrature implementations of the detected pulsed radio signal at the first point and subsequent observation points, during the entire time the source is in operation. Estimating the value of the coordinate-informative parameter is to find the temporal offset of the correlation maximum derived from correlation processing of the final samples signal-to-noise constructions recorded during several time points, with the reference sample, recorded at the first point of observation. To do this, the final samples from the sampling block are fed to the digital correlator. In the correlator, the module of the cross - correlation function (CCF) of the final samples is calculated. CCF is computed by discrete convolution of finite samples. The obtained values of time delays are transmitted via communication channels to a ground control and processing point, where the position lines are constructed and their intersection points are calculated based on the formation of pairs of independent measurements taking into account the geometric factor and the angle of intersection of the tangents to the position lines at their intersection point.

A New Optical Remote Sensing Technique for High-Resolution Mapping of Soil Moisture.,"The recently developed OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has been successfully applied for watershed scale soil moisture (SM) estimation based on remotely sensed shortwave infrared (SWIR) transformed reflectance (TRSWIR) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study is aimed at the evaluation of OPTRAM for field scale precision agriculture applications using ultrahigh spatial resolution optical observations obtained with one of the world's largest field robotic phenotyping scanners located in Maricopa, Arizona. We replaced NDVI with the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which has been shown to be more accurate for cropped agricultural fields that transition from bare soil to dense vegetation cover. The OPTRAM was parameterized based on the trapezoidal geometry of the pixel distribution within the TRSWIR-SAVI space, from which wet- and dry-edge parameters were determined. The accuracy of the resultant SM estimates is evaluated based on a comparison with ground reference measurements obtained with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors deployed to monitor surface, near-surface and root zone SM. The obtained results indicate an SM estimation error between 0.045 and 0.057 cm3 cm-3 for the near-surface and root zone, respectively. The high resolution SM maps clearly capture the spatial SM variability at the sensor locations. These findings and the presented framework can be applied in conjunction with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) observations to assist with farm scale precision irrigation management to improve water use efficiency of cropping systems and conserve water in water-limited regions of the world.",Drone,2019

Conductor Backed CPW-Fed Dual-Mode Excited High Gain Cylindrical Cavity DRA for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or Drone Data-Link Applications at C Band,"In this article, a dual-mode high gain cylindrical cavity dielectric resonator antenna (CCDRA) excited by conductor backed coplanar waveguide (CB-CPW) has been investigated for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) or drone data-link applications at the C band. A CB-CPW has been used to excite the CCDRA to achieve bore-sight radiation pattern. A wide impedance bandwidth of 1100 MHz (4.3-5.4 GHz) has been achieved due to excitation of HE11 delta and HE21 delta modes in dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) by inserting a cylindrical shaped air cavity in DRA. The antenna is finally optimized using 3-D electromagnetic simulator to achieve high gain, good impedance bandwidth, and stable radiation pattern. The prototype antenna achieves 22% impedance bandwidth with more than 7.5 dB average peak gain and 95% estimated efficiency throughout the operating band. The experimental results validate the performance of CCDRA. Such antenna can be easily installed on the unmanned aerial vehicle/drone platform for data-link as well as other applications.",Drone,2019
Scale physical hydroacoustic modeling of short-range synthetic aperture radar for light UAVs,"This article describes the technology of scale physical hydroacoustic modeling (SPHM) radar systems. SPHM includes the physical simulation of radar echo signals in hydroacoustic basin and their use in mathematical or hardware-in-the-loop simulation of the radar. It is proposed to use SPHM in the development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) of short-range, mounted on light UAVs. For radar of this type SPHM allows physical simulation at the scale of not only the wavelength of the radar and linear resolution, but also the distance and height relative to the mapped surface area of the earth, the trajectory of the radar antenna at the time of formation the synthesis of the aperture. SPHM can be used both in the initial and final stages of radar development. The scale factor equal to the ratio of the wavelength of the modeling ultrasonic signal to the wavelength of the simulated radar signal can have values approximately from 1:100 for the X-range to 1:1000 for the L-range of radar wavelengths. The characteristics of the stand SPHM, developed ""State Research Institute of Aviation Systems"", for modeling SAR on a scale of 1:100 for the X - range radar are provided.

Obtaining radar characteristics of objects via movable wideband radar measuring set,"This paper is devoted to the experimental research of using a wideband radar measuring set based on a vector network analyzer in order to provide radar cross section measurements and inverse synthetic aperture imaging in semi-naturals and naturals conditions. Modern vector network analyzers provides wideband measurements at the range 10 Mhz ... 67 Ghz in continuous and pulse modes with up to 32000 fixed frequency points. Electronic calibration module allows low error of magnitude (0.01 dB) and phase (0.1) measurements with high dynamic range (up to 130 dBm) and noise level which does not exceed -120 dBm. Vector network analyzer has integrated operational system and obtain user to control experiment in real time. All this makes it possible to create a compact movable wideband radar measuring set based on VNA with the necessary options. The analyzer and control computer are located in a mobile cabin with power generator. Two parabolic antennas (transceiver 2.4 meters diameter and receiver 1.2 meters diameter) are mounting on the roof of the cabin. Each of the antennas is equipped with the twin-polarized horn irradiator KIR 5800 DR, which operates at the frequency 4.5¡­7.5 GHz. The Dahua SD6AL240-HNI camera is mounting between two antennas for monitoring the object during an experiment time. The unmanned aerial vehicle is used to check antennas directional diagram.

COMPARISON OF ACCURACY DETERMINATION OF BULK MATERIAL PILE VOLUMES BASED ON PICTURES FROM UNMANNED AIRCRAFT AND GEO-DESIGN MEASUREMENTS,"The article describes the methodology for modeling geodetic and photogrammetric data obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles to study the accuracy of determining the volume of bulk materials piles. As the modeling pattern was accepted a frustrum elliptic cone, which most closely reminds piled stores in shape. For modeling measurement results were used the error values, peculiar to each method. After modeling the measurement results, volumes were calculated based on the construction of the TIN surface. Then the obtained results were compared with the ideal figure and the relative measurement error was calculated. As a result of the studies, it was found that the geodetic method for determining the volumes of bulk materials piles is more accurate for small volumes up to 300 thousand cubic meters, and for large sizes of piles it is more expedient to use the photogrammetric method, which is practically comparable with the geodetic in accuracy, but less time-consuming, and with a pile volume of more than 1000 thousand cubic meters, the accuracy of the photogrammetric method becomes higher than the geodetic one.",Drone,2019
Artificial and Virtual Impedance Interaction Force Reflection-Based Bilateral Shared Control for Miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,"In this paper, we propose artificial and virtual-impedance interaction force reflection-based shared control strategy for bilateral telemanipulation of miniature aerial vehicle (MAV). The shared input for the master is designed by combining the velocity of the slave-MAV system with the scaled position-velocity of the master manipulator. The master input also uses the reflected interaction force between the slave and remote environment. The interaction force between environment and MAV is modeled by using two different approaches as the artificial and virtual impedance force field. The reflected interaction force applies to the human operators' hand through the haptic manipulator. The interaction force provides a situational awareness about the remote environment, guiding the operator to navigate and control the MAV for a safe and stable interaction with the remote environment. The shared control input for the slave is designed by combining the velocity of the MAV with the scaled position-velocity of the master manipulator. The convergence analysis of the closed-loop bilateral shared control system is shown by using the Lyapunov method. The analysis shows that the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable and ultimately bounded in the presence of passive and nonpassive interaction with the environment and the human operator. The design is implemented and evaluated on a quadrotor MAV with both artificial and virtual impedance force field based interaction interfaces to demonstrate the effectiveness for the real-time interaction with the environment.",Drone,2019
Research on BatSLAM Algorithm for UAV Based on Audio Perceptual Hash Closed-Loop Detection,"This research is aimed at the optimization of a two-dimensional (2D) empirical graph under a certain height and dark conditions for a UAV, using the bionic sonar system to replace the visual sensor's BatSLAM mode and audio perceptual hash closed-loop detection. The BatSLAM model uses Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) image processing methods to update the bionic sonar template. This method only judges whether the appearance of the two cochlear images is consistent and does not have geometric processing and feature extraction. Because the cochlear images produce various noises during the acquisition and transmission, there are some differences in cochlear maps obtained at the same position, which can lead to the distortion of the constructed empirical map. In this research, an audio perceptual hash closed-loop detection algorithm is developed to extract features of cochlea. It considers both the appearance and the energy difference between adjacent bands to improve the accuracy of closed-loop detection, thus solving the distortion problem and improving the experience map. The simulation experiment shows that the improved BatSLAM model based on the audio perceptual hash closed-loop detection can improve the 2D experience map for UAV under certain height and dark conditions, through improving the accuracy of the closed-loop detection to solve the distortion problem and thus implementing the optimization of the experience graph.",Drone,2019
Aerodynamic Characteristics and Flight Testing of a UAV without Control Surfaces Based on Circulation Control,"Attitude control of a conventional aircraft usually depends on its rudder surface, which reduces the aircraft's stealth abilities and makes it heavier. To improve aerodynamic performance and optimize flight attitude control, the authors developed a set of circulation-control actuators (CCAs) based on circulation-control (CC) technology to replace the conventional rudder surface and applied these CCAs to a flight test of a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The authors measure the main characteristic parameters of the CCAs and the flow-field characteristics, which indicate that the CCAs can suppress separation and delay stall at high angles of attack. An experimental assessment of rudder efficiency shows that the CCAs can produce the rudder efficiency required for conventional flight attitude control. Specifically, the maximum roll rudder efficiency that the CCA generates is equivalent to an aileron deflection of 50 degrees, and the maximum pitch rudder efficiency is equivalent to an elevator deflection of 10 degrees at a speed of 10m/s. Finally, a successful flight test of a rudderless (meaning no control surface) UAV based on CC technology indicates that the CCAs designed in this study could replace conventional ailerons and elevators completely to establish control of aircraft flight attitude.

"Protocol for the Definition of a Multi-Spectral Sensor for Specific Foliar Disease Detection: Case of ""Flavescence Doree"".","Flavescence Doree (FD) is a contagious and incurable grapevine disease that can be perceived on leaves. In order to contain its spread, the regulations obligate winegrowers to control each plant and to remove the suspected ones. Nevertheless, this monitoring is performed during the harvest and mobilizes many people during a strategic period for viticulture. To solve this problem, we aim to develop a Multi-Spectral (MS) imaging device ensuring an automated grapevine disease detection solution. If embedded on a UAV, the tool can provide disease outbreaks locations in a geographical information system allowing localized and direct treatment of infected vines. The high-resolution MS camera aims to allow the identification of potential FD occurrence, but the procedure can, more generally, be used to detect any type of foliar diseases on any type of vegetation.Our work consists on defining the spectral bands of the multispectral camera, responsible for identifying the desired symptoms of the disease. In fact, the FD diseased samples were selected after establishing a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) confirmation test and then a feature selection technique was applied to identify the best subset of wavelengths capable of detecting FD samples. An example of a preliminary version of the MS sensor was also presented along with the geometric and radiometric required corrections. An image analysis based on texture and neural networks was also detailed for an enhanced disease classification.",Drone,2019

Through simulation and calculation, it discusses the different pattern of optical axis angle of depression and flight altitude from the width of detect annulus. The paper also provides the basis for the best optical axis angle of depression and flight altitude to meet the operational requirements. At last, the searching method of anti-submarine patrol aircraft using acquisition radar is put forward.",Patrol aircraft,2017

Rotor Position Detection Based on Magnetically Coupled Resonant Principle and Its Implementation,"Rotor position sensing is necessary in electric traction applications to enhance the reliability of control, and inductive-based sensors such as resolvers and eddy current sensors are most used due to their working well in harsh environment. Since the existing methods show some limitations, it is significant to explore the new type of sensor to improve the performance. This paper introduces a novel angular sensor with novel structure based on magnetically coupled resonant principle. It is made using printed circuit board (PCB), consisting of the excitation circuit and receiving circuit located at the stator side, and the feedback circuit located at the rotor side. Besides, the coil of each circuit is in series with corresponding capacitors to make the whole system work at the same resonant frequency. With this structure, the sensor has sufficient output gain without ferromagnetic material used. The working principle and structural design of the sensor are described in detail, and in the finite element analysis (FEA) the coil structure is calculated to preliminarily verify the sensing accuracy, finally a sensor prototype was fabricated for precision test and its sensitivity test with respect to the stator's misalignment. The experiment results show that the peak-to-peak value of the error is within 1 degrees (electric angle) under quasi-static state, 2.234 degrees (electric angle) at the speed of 20000rpm, and the output gain is about 2.6. Moreover, the test of sensitivity to misalignment shows that the air-coupling-based sensor has good sensing stability with non-negligible mounting shift of the stator, to reflect the reliability in harsh conditions.",Patrol aircraft,2021
Inversion of Magnetic Dipole Parameters Using a Scalar Field Gradiometer,"Magnetic anomaly detection (MAD) from military patrol aircraft is a trusted technique for detecting a submarine. The final goal of MAD is to obtain reliable target localization and identification. This task could be accomplished if the MAD system comprises two scalar magnetometers that are combined to form a gradiometer, and the target is modeled as a dipole. The present work proposes a novel algorithm to solve the dipole localization problem. It is shown that a set of linearly independent functions can accurately describe the scalar magnetic field gradient for a wide range of separation distances between sensors. Decomposition of the signal in the space of these functions allowed the estimation of the target position and its magnetic moment. The solution is unique although affected by errors from the estimation of the gradient when a finite baseline separates the sensors. Statistical processing of computer simulation results shows good algorithm convergence and acceptable relative errors of target parameters estimation.",Patrol aircraft,2021
Deterrence or Numbness? Insights into the Psychological Effects of the Encirclement Patrols Conducted by People's Liberation Army Vessels and Aircraft around Taiwan,"This study investigated the psychological effects of the long-term military intimidation imposed by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) on the Taiwanese public. Online texts dating between 2016 and 2018 were mined and Russell's (1980) semantic analysis was used to analyze the online discussions among the Taiwanese public regarding the PLA vessels and aircraft patrolling around Taiwan. The results showed that the PLA's long-term encirclement patrols have generated numbness among the Taiwanese public. With regard to the Taiwanese government's policy of disclosing information about such military encirclement patrols, the effects of proliferating this information were not significant, but have led to an increased sense of fear among the public. These findings suggest that the effects of the PLA's encirclement patrols around Taiwan are not determined by the PLA, but by the Taiwanese government's policies regarding the disclosure of relevant information on encirclement patrols.",Patrol aircraft,2020

Assessing Intelligent Software Agents for Training Maritime Patrol Aircraft Crews,"Training simulators often require the participation of several people to play the role of supporting players in the simulated operation. Use of intelligent software agents to play the role of these personnel has the potential to reduce support staff and increase an instructor's control of training. This report evaluates a simulator prototype developed for the CP140 Aurora maritime patrol aircraft that incorporated intelligent software agents to play the roles of the Tactical Navigator and an Acoustic Sensor Operator. Human crews, intelligent agent crews, and mixed human-agent crews performed a simulated antisubmarine mission. Mission performance and crew communications were recorded and rated to determine whether the intelligent software agents could perform individual crewmember functions and whether they could provide the interaction necessary for crew coordination training. The results indicate that: (1) agents can perform individual crewmembers' functions; (2) agent interaction with humans is sufficient to allow humans to perform their own tasks; and (3) the agents did not interact in a way suitable for crew coordination training. It is concluded that the prototype is suitable for supporting individual training, but the agents' knowledge base must explicitly address team dynamics if crew coordination training is to be supported.",Patrol aircraft,2020
Relationship Between Training and Unit Performance for Naval Patrol Aircraft,"This report develops quantitative relationships between how much air crews train and how well they perform important aspects of their missions. It examines the performance of Navy Patrol air crews in the P-3 aircraft. The performance data were derived from graded torpedo exercises flown on an instrumented range. The crew must detect, classify, track, and successfully launch an exercise torpedo to qualify in the exercise. The P-3 carries a multi-person crew, including a pilot, tactical coordinator (both officers), and enlisted sensor operators. We gathered data covering both the long-term and short-term training experience of crew members and considered training both in the aircraft and in simulators. Statistical analyses were performed to estimate relationships between training and performance. The analyses showed both short- and long-term positive effects of flying hours on air crew performance. Long-term experience was more important. Although data on long-term simulator use were not available, recent simulator experience was found to be particularly cost-effective.

Training for a New Weapon System: Proposals for Introducing a New Maritime Patrol Aircraft Weapon System to the Operational Active and Reserve Forces,"The P-3C Update IV antisubmarine warfare system presently under development is scheduled for fleet introduction in the mid-1990's. This ASW system represents a marked increase in both capability and complexity. The introduction of a new ASW system has, coincidentally, been paralleled by major improvements in the Soviet submarine force, changes in Soviet deployment patterns and proliferation of submarines among Third World navies. Lessons learned from the recent Persian Gulf War indicate an expanded antisurface warfare mission for maritime patrol aircraft combat aircrews. In order to meet the challenge of changing and expanded mission areas while realizing the full potential of a new avionics system a comprehensive training plan needs to be developed. A plan of training, coordinating all phases of aircrew instruction, should be under the supervision of a Fleet Introduction Team. Consideration should be given to implementation of computer based training, increased employment of simulators, changes in the mission area emphasis of the current aircrew qualifications and expanded training opportunities against diesel submarines.",Patrol aircraft,2020
Quantitative fractography of fatigue and an illustrative case study,"Quantitative fractography (QF) may be used for measuring service- and test-induced fatigue crack growth (FCG) in metallic components and structures. The QF compares progression and striation markings on fatigue fracture surfaces with known occurrences in the components' load histories. This paper concisely surveys fatigue-related QF, followed by a case study for a crack in a component from a maritime patrol aircraft. The case study illustrates how a FCG versus time history can be estimated. This was achieved using (i) knowledge of when the crack was detected, (ii) a reconstruction of the aircraft usage history from counting accelerometer (g-meter) data, (iii) an exponential FCG model of how cracking could have progressed, and (iv) QF of progression markings. Comparison of the reconstructed usage data and the QF information showed that the model provided a useful correlation.",Patrol aircraft,2019
Legal Issues and Challenges on whether ROK's Warship Aimed Fire Control Radars at Japans' P-1 Maritime Patrol Aircraft,"The Japanese Government claimed that the Navy of the Republic of Korea (hereinafter referred to as ""Korea"") had used fire control radars during the rescue of North Korean vessels in the joint fishing zone on December 20, 2018, and the Korean Government vehemently denied it. The diplomatic dispute signified the red light of security cooperation between Korea and Japan for the following three reasons. Firstly, the P-1 Maritime Patrol Aircraft issue showed that Korea could face Japan's provocations in the joint fishing zone even if Dokdo issue is not concerned. Secondly, the legal consequences of the issue were not insignificant because Korean Navy's fire control radar operation and Japanese P-1 Maritime Patrol Aircraft's approach towards Korean warship in a dangerous manner could have allowed for the armed response of the opposite based on the right to unit self-defense. Lastly, Japan interfered with the rescue activities instead of fulfilling , in cooperation with the ROK, the obligations to rescue the victims in distress at sea under the international law.Therefore, after describing the three legal issues related to the P-1 Maritime Patrol Aircraft matter (including the joint fishing zone between Korea and Japan, the requirements for the exercise of the right to unit self-defense, and the international legal obligations during maritime distress), the countermeasures on the part of the Korean Government were reviewed in this article.",Patrol aircraft,2019
Application of a Winch-type Towed Acoustic Sensor to a Wave-powered Unmanned Surface Vehicle,"Although many countries have focused on anti-submarine warfare for several decades, underwater submarines can hardly be detected by current assets such as patrol aircraft, surface ships and fixed underwater surveillance systems. Due to the difficult conditions of the oceanic environment and the relative quietness of submarines, existing acoustic surveillance platforms are not able to fully cover their mission areas. To fill in the gaps, a winch-type towed acoustic sensor system was developed and integrated into a wave-powered unmanned surface vehicle by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology. Sea trial tests were conducted to verify manoeuvering, acoustic signal detection, and communication capabilities. During the manoeuvering test, the wave-powered glider successfully moved along programmed waypoints. Despite towing the acoustic sensor system, only 20 per cent of initial electricity was consumed in 20 days. The acoustic sensor was lowered to depths of 100 m -150 m by the winch system, and received signals from an acoustic simulator lowered to depths of 50 m -100 m by RV Jangmok. The continuously simulated tonal signals as submarine noises that were refracted downward could be clearly received and identified by the hydrophone system, from distances of 2 km - 8 km, while it was being towed silently and deeply. In addition, an optical camera provided high-resolution images of surface vessels, allowing integration with acoustic detection of underwater objects. In conclusion, this new platform using a deeply towed hydrophone system is worthy of consideration as an underwater surveillance asset. Future work is required to strengthen inter-asset communication and obstacle avoidance, and to overcome strong currents to make this technology a reliable part of the underwater surveillance network.",Patrol aircraft,2017
A Study on the Development of Modern U.S. Naval Anti-submarine Warfare Tactics,"The great capabilities of submarines as a weapon of war were first revealed during World War ¢ñ, when the German U-Boat campaign almost proved decisive. Against the German U-Boat, the U. S. Navy adopted a convoy system in 1917. As a result of various passive and defensive countermeasures, the U.S. Navy successfully eliminated the threats posed by U-Boats. Although shipping losses had decreased, it should be kept in mind that, from an offensive point of view, the U-Boat had not been assuredly beaten during World War ¢ñ. Therefore, it is clear that the Allies had not developed any offensive weapon during World War ¢ñ which could deal effectively with the U-Boat at sea.Same as the first World War, U-Boats in early World War ¢ò operated as submersible torpedo crafts which relied heavily on the surface for movement and battery generation. This pattern was repeated in World War ¢ò until the Allies' anti-submarine countermeasures had forced the Germans to modify their existing U-Boats with the schnorchel. The U.S. Navy doctrine was based on the combination of active and offensive anti-submarine measures that had stood the test of time since 1917, despite considerable technological changes. Especially, the emergence of patrol aircraft as anti-submarine asset contributed to complement the active and offensive anti-submarine tactics. Maintaining aircraft patrol not only lead to detecting U-Boats, thus permitting allies' ships to evacuate, but these aircraft also forced U-Boats to dive, thus hindering them in their effort to track a ship and approach it.By studying U.S. Navy anti-submarine tactics, this article could discover that passive and defensive anti-submarine warfare in World War ¢ñ developed into active and offensive anti-submarine warfare in World War ¢ò. This article provides essential and additional insights on how modern anti-submarine warfare was invented and developed.",Patrol aircraft,2017

The Lightly Manned Autonomous Combat Capability (LMACC),"As technology continues to move forward and a continued emphasis is placed on construction of large ships and submarines, there is another possibility. That is to construct a third tier of small combatants that project power from the sea in contested environments and employ a ""shoot first"" backed by a ""second salvo."" These vessels would be constructed based on the lessons learned from automation of the medium unmanned surface vessel (MUSV) Sea Hunter, in which most ship functions and basic navigation would be automated. The new vessel, called Sea Fighter, would have a crew of 15 and have a single combat mission: to deliver long-range precision weapons and distribute secondary combat functions among the pack of Sea Fighters and Sea Hunters. An analysis of total ship costs is applied in a simulation and comparison to other vessels.

Experimental ballistic performance determination of friction stir welded magnesium (AZ31B) targets,"Nowadays there is an increasing demand to develop light weight defense vehicles, fighter aircrafts and warships in order to enhance their mobility and fuel economy. It can be achieved by using the light weight structures made up of Aluminum and Magnesium plates which will reduce the weight, increase the payload carrying capacity and efficiency of the vehicles. In the present work, experimental ballistic performance of Magnesium (AZ31B) Base Metal (BM), friction-stir-welded (FSW) and post-weld-heat treated (PWHT) target plates have been determined by using the 7.62 mm Armor Piercing Projectiles (APP). Prior to ballistic testing, Magnesium joints were prepared by the FSW process for various tool rotational and welding speeds. Defect-free welds with better tensile and impact properties, were obtained with tool rotational speed of 1200 rpm and the welding speed of 50 mm/min. PWHT was carried out with the annealing temperature at 250 degrees C for about 1 hour. Microhardness and microstructure of the FSW and PWHT joints were investigated. Highest hardness (67 HV) was obtained for fine grain structure and precipitated particles were observed for PWHT targets. Depth of Penetration of PWHT target plates was approximately 17.55% and 16.31% lower than the BM and FSW target plates respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopic observation of projectile penetrated channel showed the formation of Adiabatic Shear Bands (ASBs). Due to a larger number of ASB lines, ballistic impacted FSW surface showed more number of macro cracks compared to PWHT surface. The PWHT joints showed the absence of fragmentation failure, lesser cracks and ASB lines which increased the ballistic performance.",Fighter,2020
Fatigue Reliability Analysis of a Compressor Disk Based on Probability Cumulative Damage Criterion,"The reliability of aero engine has a direct impact on the flight safety of the whole plane. With the continuous improvement of performance requirements of aero engines, the related fatigue and reliability problems also appear. For the fatigue failure characteristics of the typical component (compressor disk) in an aero engine, the fatigue reliability of its multi-site damage structure in service is analyzed by using probability cumulative damage criterion in this paper. The probability distribution definitions of life, damage and damage threshold are discussed and the relationship among them is also introduced by the new proposed criterion. Meanwhile, a method to determine the probability distribution of cumulative damage threshold and probability life prediction is carried out, based on which a hierarchical index system of statistical analysis and reliability modeling principle on the system level is further constructed for compressor disk. At the end of the paper, a certain cruise of fighter plane is analyzed to verify the validity of the new model. Emphasizing the difference between the compressor disk and traditional component, the new reliability analysis model developed in this study is basically reasonable for most of the load histories for the compressor disk, other than the traditional one, especially for the changeable and complex cruise missions.",Fighter,2020
Weight optimization of a composite wing-panel with flutter stability constraints by ply-drop,"The existing approach in aircraft wing design optimizes the structure for strength and buckling design criteria followed by a flutter stability check, which leads to design that may not be optimal. This study proposes the flutter stability as an integral of weight optimization by a two-step procedure. Step 1 comprises series of flutter and static analyses of finite element (FE) models with different weapon configurations and aerodynamic loads, which give limiting values of wing tip deflection and wing twist as flutter constraints. Step 2 focuses on weight optimization of the laminate for strength and stiffness design parameters along with the flutter constraints. The algorithm minimizes structural weight by ply drop, which is based on evaluation of the fitness value of laminates generated by a stochastic operator. The ply drop design algorithm is applied to optimize the FE model of a fourth-generation fighter aircraft wing box with three representative aerodynamic loads and three weapon configurations. The application evolved optimal laminate with seamless and symmetric plies, which has 35% lesser weight compared with the initial model having quasi-isotropic laminates for given strength and flutter stability design requirement. The application of genetic algorithm (GA) to get an initial laminate instead of quasi-isotropic laminates further improved the design by 2.5% weight reduction.",Fighter,2020
High AOA decoupling control for aircraft based on ADRC,"In this paper, a practical decoupling control scheme for fighter aircraft is proposed to achieve high angle of attack (AOA) tracking and super maneuver action by utilizing the thrust vector technology. Firstly, a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) nonlinear model with 12 variables is given. Due to low sufficiency of the aerodynamic actuators at high AOA, a thrust vector model with rotatable engine nozzles is derived. Secondly, the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is used to realize a three-channel decoupling control such that a strong coupling between different channels can be treated as total disturbance, which is estimated by the designed extended state observer. The control surface allocation is implemented by the traditional daisy chain method. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented control strategy is demonstrated by some numerical simulation results.",Fighter,2020
Universal Adaptive Neural Network Predictive Algorithm for Remotely Piloted Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle in Wireless Sensor Network,"Remotely piloted unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) will be a prospective mode of air fight in the future, which can remove the physical restraint of the pilot, maximize the performance of the fighter and effectively reduce casualties. However, it has two difficulties in this mode: (1) There is greater time delay in the network of pilot-wireless sensor-UCAV, which can degrade the piloting performance. (2) Designing of a universal predictive method is very important to pilot different UCAVs remotely, even if the model of the control augmentation system of the UCAV is totally unknown. Considering these two issues, this paper proposes a novel universal modeling method, and establishes a universal nonlinear uncertain model which uses the pilot's remotely piloted command as input and the states of the UCAV with a control augmentation system as output. To deal with the nonlinear uncertainty of the model, a neural network observer is proposed to identify the nonlinear dynamics model online. Meanwhile, to guarantee the stability of the overall observer system, an adaptive law is designed to adjust the neural network weights. To solve the greater transmission time delay existing in the pilot-wireless sensor-UCAV closed-loop system, a time-varying delay state predictor is designed based on the identified nonlinear dynamics model to predict the time delay states. Moreover, the overall observer-predictor system is proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Finally, two simulations verify the effectiveness and universality of the proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method has desirable performance of accurately compensating the time delay and has universality of remotely piloting two different UCAVs.",Fighter,2020
A New Method for Control Allocation of Aircraft Flight Control System,"The next generation of aircraft with a large number of effectors will require advanced methods for control allocation (CA) to compute the effectors' commands needed to follow the desired objective while respecting associated constraints. Currently, the main challenge of the CA is to achieve low enough computation time with a deterministically optimal result for a real-time application. In this paper, at first, we cast the CA as a nonlinear convex programming problem which depicts the desired objective function subject to three-axis moment demands and the limits of effectors' movement; then we develop a computationally tractable method for real-time application on the CA of the aircraft flight control system. The method can analytically and deterministically give one optimal solution for the CA and prove this optimal solution to be guaranteed within a certainly maximal computation time. Numerical testing results based on Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and Lockheed-Martin tailless fighter models demonstrate that the method is effective in terms of its computational efficiency, accuracy, and reliability.",Fighter,2020
AESA radar and IRST against low observable threats,"PurposeModern fighter aircraft using active electronically scanned array (AESA) fire control radars are able to detect and track targets at long ranges, in the order of 50 nautical miles or more. Low observable or stealth technology has contested the radar capabilities, reducing detection/tracking ranges roughly to one-third (or even less, for fighter aircraft radar). Hence, infrared search and track (IRST) systems have been reconsidered as an alternative to the radar. This study aims to explore and compare the capabilities and limitations of these two technologies, AESA radars and IRST systems, as well as their synergy through sensor fusion.Design/methodology/approachThe AESA radar range is calculated with the help of the radar equation under certain assumptions, taking into account heat dissipation requirements, using the F-16 fighter as a case study. Concerning the IRST sensor, a new model is proposed for the estimation of the detection range, based on the emitted infrared radiation caused by aerodynamic heating.FindingsThe maximum detection range provided by an AESA radar could be restricted because of the increased waste heat which is produced and the relevant constraints concerning the cooling capacity of the carrying aircraft. On the other hand, IRST systems exhibit certain advantages over radars against low observable threats. IRST could be combined with a datalink with the help of data fusion, offering weapons-quality track.Originality/valueAn original approach is provided for the IRST detection range estimation. The AESA/IRST comparison offers valuable insight, while it allows for more efficient planning, at the military acquisition phase, as well as at the tactical level.",Fighter,2020
Numerical Simulation of the Aerodynamic Influence of Aircrafts During Aerial Refueling with Engine Jet,"Aerial refueling technology has been widely applied in various fields and it is one of the hotspots but difficulties for the aeronautical technologies. DLR-F6 WBNP model is used as a tanker and a fighter model is used as a receiver. The flow field of Probe-Drogue refueling and Flying Boom refueling is numerically simulated using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations, and the effects of the jet flow and the aerodynamic characteristics of the receiver are taken into consideration. The results indicate that the effect of downwash of the tanker reduces the lift coefficient and decreases the pitching moment coefficient of the receiver. The jet flow of tanker increases the dynamic pressure while decreases the local angle of attack, which increases the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces of receiver. Compared with the results without jet, the jet flow can increase the lift and the drag of the receiver and reduces the pitching moment, and even cause the change of rolling moment direction. Therefore, engine jet is an important factor when simulating aerial refueling.",Fighter,2020
Reliability Analysis of Aero-Engine Compressor Rotor System Considering Cruise Characteristics,"This paper develops an improved dynamic reliability model for compressor rotor system, defined as a ""unconventional active system"" here. First, regarding to the variety of system-component connections, system specific reliability modeling technique is presented, in which the stress and strength are both nonnegative stochastic processes. The new model fully considers the load characteristics of rotor blades, and inherently embodied the effect of the statistical dependence between the failures of the rotor blades. Then, calculated by the new model, the relationship between reliability and time, and that between the hazard rate and time, for a compressor rotor system are discussed, respectively. Comparing to the traditional series system reliability model, the new system reliability model developed in this paper has higher accuracy for compressor rotor system, since the traditional models neglect the difference between compressor rotor system and traditional active system. Moreover, in order to master the cruise characteristics of the aero-plane during reliability analysis of its compressor rotor blade set, a flight cruise is separated into several stages based on the value of Mach number and its change rate, and a subsection solution method is innovatively proposed accordingly. At the end of the paper, a certain cruise of fighter plane is analyzed to verify the accuracy of the new method. The results show that, as to a flight cruise with different stages, the new method is basically reasonable to most of the load histories, especially for the situation with impact loads existing.",Fighter,2020
Application of Fuzzy Reference Ideal Method (FRIM) to the military advanced training aircraft selection,"When a nation needs to acquire a new military training aircraft for its Air Force, many factors must be taken into account. This requires a good command of conflicting factors, which can benefit from the domain of Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). However, some criteria involved in the assessment process are often imprecise or vague and the use of linguistic terms characterized by fuzzy numbers could be advisable. The aim of this research is thus to extract the best of a combination of Fuzzy MCDM approaches with the aim of solving a real decision problem of interest for the Spanish Air Force, specifically, the selection of the best military advanced training aircraft, based on a set of criteria of differing natures. This decision problem involves, on the one hand, quantitative or technical criteria (combat ceiling, operational speed, take-off race, etc.) and, on the other hand, qualitative criteria (maneuverability, ergonomics, etc.) based on the experience of a set of flight instructors of the 23rd Fighter and Attack Training Wing, collected via questionnaires. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to obtain the weights of the criteria, whereas the Reference Ideal Method (RIM) and its Fuzzy version (FRIM) are used to evaluate the alternatives based on a reference ideal alternative defined by the flight instructors mentioned above. As a result, the Italian Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master aircraft was selected as the best option. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Fighter,2020
Cognitive Workload Analysis of Fighter Aircraft Pilots in Flight Simulator Environment,"Maintaining and balancing an optimal level of workload is essential for completing the task productively. Fighter aircraft is one such example, where the pilot is loaded heavily both physically (due to G manoeuvering) and cognitively (handling multiple sensors, perceiving, processing and multi-tasking including communications and handling weapons) to fulfill the combat mission requirements. This cognitive demand needs to be analysed to understand the workload of fighter pilot. Objective of this study is to analyse dynamic workload of fighter pilots in a realistic high-fidelity flight simulator environment during different flying workload conditions. The various workload conditions are (a) normal visibility, (b) low visibility, (c) normal visibility with secondary task, and (d) low visibility with secondary task. Though, pilot's flying performance score was good, the physiological measure like heart rate variability (HRV) features and subjective assessment (NASA-TLX) components are found to be statistically significant (p<0.05) between tasks. HRV features such as SD2, SDNN, VLF and total power are found to be significant at all task load conditions. The features LFnu and HFnu are able to differentiate the effect of low visibility and secondary cognitive task, which was imposed as increased task in this study. This result benefits to understand the pilot's task and performance at each flying phase and their cognitive demands during dynamic workload using HRV, which could assist pilot's training schedule in optimal way on simulators as well as in actual flight conditions.",Fighter,2020
Innovative Method for the Estimation of Closure Velocity between RAT Driven Drogue and IFR Probe: Air-to-Air refueling Flight Trials,Air-to-air refueling for a fighter platform is a force multiplier in terms of increasing its combat radius and payload carrying ability. Adapting for such a facility especially for an aircraft under design and development is a challenging task. It requires rigorous ground and flight testing to meet the certification standards. One of important flight test parameter that needs to be validated for structural impact load calculations and certification needs is the closure velocity. The air-to-air refueller was equipped with a Ram-air-turbine powered drogue and chute system. An innovative methodology of estimating the closure velocity between the drogue of the mother aircraft and the in-flight refueling probe of the receiving aircraft was evolved. The method was employed and validated during the air-to-air refueling trials of a prototype fighter platform. The intention of this paper is to explain the methodology employed and deliberate the results obtained with respect to the air-to-air refueling certification.,Fighter,2020
A parallel implicit hole-cutting method based on background mesh for unstructured Chimera grid,"As an efficient simulation method for complex configurations and moving boundary problems in computational fluid dynamics, Chimera or overset grid techniques have been widely used in many aspects of aeronautics and astronautics. However, there are still some bottlenecks for the current hole-cutting method to handle large scale mesh, such as memory storage limitation and parallel efficiency. In this paper, a parallel implicit hole-cutting method based on unstructured background mesh is presented. The method is based on the parallel searching of donor cells for all grid nodes. In order to reduce the memory consumption of the searching procedure for the large-scale grids, a global-to-local (GTL) searching strategy as well as the background grid approach is developed. To improve the connectivity of overset domains, a parallel front advancing method is adopted to automatically distinguish the active regions. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the present Chimera grid method are validated by some test cases and applications, including multi-store separation from a fighter and a missile pitching-up maneuvering with rudder deflection under a control command. The numerical results demonstrate the potential for steady and unsteady CFD simulations for complex geometries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Fighter,2020
Rising Costs: Augustine Revisited,"Rising military equipment costs were famously identified by Norman Augustine with forecasts of a single aircraft air force by 2054. This paper presents and analyses an original data set for UK military aircraft. It provides evidence on cost escalation for various UK aircraft types comprising fighter/strike, bombers, military transports, maritime patrol aircraft, helicopters, trainers and civil aircraft. Continued cost escalation is identified for almost all types but with different cost escalation factors. It is concluded that the specific Augustine hypothesis of costs rising by a factor of four every 10 years might be an under-estimate.",Fighter,2020
Complex Interaction Between a Fin and a Transverse Jet at Mach 5,"The maneuverability of high-speed flight vehicles such as fighters or missiles determines their survivability in dogfighting or penetrating missile defense systems. A combined attitude control system using both aerodynamic control surfaces and reaction control thrusters has been applied to some of the latest military flight vehicles. This paper aims to shed some light on the interaction between a control surface and a downstream control jet, which has rarely been studied. A model consisting of a flat plate, a fin, and a transverse jet is tested using various experimental techniques at Mach 5 to investigate the complex interaction between the fin and the downstream jet. Schlieren and planar laser scattering are used to study the pattern of shock wave interactions and structures in the boundary layer, and pressure-sensitive paint is used to examine the pressure distribution on the flat plate. The results show that the state of the approaching boundary layer, the structure of the jet-induced bow shock, and the pressure distribution around the nozzle are sensitive to the position of the jet relative to the fin. The pressure around the nozzle exit is substantially increased in all three cases tested, and the highest peak pressure occurs when the jet is located after the fin-induced reattachment shock. However, by integrating the surface pressure, the highest side force on the flat plate is noticed to occur when the jet nozzle is located between the fin-induced separation shock and reattachment shock.",Fighter,2020
XPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A DIRECT-DETECTION RECEIVER,"The emergence of electronic warfare is inextricably linked with the invention and introduction of radio communications in the military. Electronic warfare (EW) usually loses attention to fighters, tanks, anti-aircraft missile systems, etc. However, their significance in modern warfare is extremely large and diverse: from the suppression of remotely detonated improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and disrupting enemy communications to the fight against air defense systems or enemy aircraft. Direction finding receivers are an important part of electronic warfare equipment. Receivers of direct amplification do not emit, they do not have a heterodyne, so they can be detected only by a nonlinear locator, and this in turn is very problematic because they depend on the range of operating frequencies, sensitivity, dynamic range of amplitudes, accuracy of bearing and measurement of pulse duration, so their study is relevant. Logarithmic receivers found wide application for detection and direction finding of radiation sources. They have high accuracy, sufficient speed and good repeatability. Previously, logarithmic receivers of centimeter and millimeter wave ranges were studied [1-5], but their technical level is currently insufficient for a number of parameters: dynamic range, mass, dimensions, current consumption and cost. Possible ways to improve the receiver are to reduce the unevenness of the amplitude-frequency response, expand its functionality in terms of energy protection, blocking out-of-band signals, and expanding the dynamic range. Even more important is to increase the channel identity of the multi-channel receiver to reduce the bearing error. The purpose of this work is to expand the dynamic range of the receiver, reduce its mass, size and current consumption. The following requirements apply to the receiver: operating frequency range from 18 to 40 GHz; tangential sensitivity is not worse than minus 90 dBW; the dynamic range of signals at the receiver input is at least 55 dB; the minimum pulse duration is 0.1 MS; current consumption in the circuit +5 V no more than 0.45 A; the current consumption in the circuit minus 5 V is not more than 60 mA. The basic parameters of the receiver are calculated and the dynamic range of the receiver is estimated as minimum and maximum. The advantages and disadvantages of the receiver and composite microwave nodes were also described.",Fighter,2020

An Effective Adjustment to the Integration of Optimal Computing Budget Allocation for Particle Swarm Optimization in Stochastic Environments,"Although particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a powerful evolutionary algorithm for solving nonlinear optimization problems in deterministic environments, many practical problems have some stochastic noise. The optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) has been integrated into PSO in various ways to cope with this. The OCBA can mitigate the effect of noise on PSO by selecting the best solution under a limited evaluation budget. Recently, with the increasing complexity of PSO applications, the evaluation costs are also increasing rapidly, which has sparked the need for more efficient PSO in stochastic environments. This article proposes a simple yet effective adjustment to the integration of OCBA to further improve the efficiency of PSO. The proposed adjustment allows OCBA to expand its search space to find the global best position more correctly such that the entire swarm can move on a better direction under stochastic noise. The experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the improved performance of PSO by the proposed adjustment under a limited budget compared with the latest studies. In addition, the results regarding fighters' evasion flight optimization emphasize the practical need for the proposed adjustment.",Fighter,2020
An Improved Moth Flame Optimization Algorithm for Minimizing Specific Fuel Consumption of Variable Cycle Engine,"The effective selection of Variable Cycle Engine (VCE) parameters plays a key role in achieving low specific fuel consumption (SFC) of fighters. However, the selection of VCE parameters is a continuous multimodal issue involving substantial local optima, so that most swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms are easily trapped into local optimal solutions, and cannot obtain satisfactory performance. To address this problem, an improved moth flame optimization algorithm with adaptive Levy-Flight perturbations (ALFMFO) is proposed. In ALFMFO, the current population aggregation status can be accurately judged based on the difference in fitness variance between two successive moth generations. According to the population aggregation status, the Levy-Flight disturbance strategy can adaptively adjust the perturbation probability to enhance the ability of ALFMFO to escape from local optimal solutions and realize the minimum SFC optimization of VCE. Experimental results suggest that ALFMFO is effective and superior to other compared SI algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness.",Fighter,2020
Nondominated Maneuver Strategy Set With Tactical Requirements for a Fighter Against Missiles in a Dogfight,"Dogfight is often a continuous and multi-round process with missile attacks. If the fighter only considers the security when evading the incoming missile, it will easily lose the superiority in subsequent air combat. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain as much tactical superiority as possible while ensuring a successful evasion. The amalgamative tactical requirements of achieving multiple evasive objectives in a dogfight are taken into account in this paper. A method of generating a nondominated maneuver strategy set for evading missiles with tactical requirements is proposed. The tactical requirements include higher miss distance, less energy consumption, and higher terminal superiority. Then the evasion problem is defined and reformulated into a multi-objective optimization problem, which is solved by a redesigned multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Simulations are used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. A set of approximate Pareto-optimal solutions satisfying the tactical requirements are obtained. These solutions can not only guide the fighter to avoid being hit but also achieve the goal of relatively reducing energy consumption and improving terminal superiority.",Fighter,2020
'Technical violence' in the Dutch-Indonesian War Heavy weapons in the period of decolonization,"In this contribution, the authors want to offer a first response to the observation that research about the use of heavy weapons in the Dutch-Indonesian War yet shows major lacunae. In order to put the Dutch deployment of this `indirect fire', primarily by artillery and fighter planes, into context, the authors first examine how other military forces used heavy arms in the same period as part of regular and irregular wars. In the case of Indonesia, they analyse the use of what is also termed `technical violence' in the Dutch debate and they take a closer look at the `Wonosari incident'. They conclude that the Dutch militaries used technical violence in similar ways as other military forces, and they question the common assumption that indirect weapons led to more casualties among non-combatants than direct violence did.",Fighter,2020
Vortex Dynamics Analysis of Straight-Body-Type-Fuselage Fighter Using CFD Simulation,"ABSTRACT: The choice for using a fighter fuselage in a fighter jet design affects a vortex generation advantageous in maneuverability. To study the effect of straight-body-type-fuselage (SBTF) on the vortex dynamic, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used, in order to simulate a model of SBTF fighter. The simulation uses Q-criterion to probe vortices, and a logarithmic grid to emphasize the micro-gridding effect of the turbulent boundary layer. The results show detailed quantitative velocity, pressure, trajectory of the vortex core, and wing negative surface pressure distribution (SPD), providing clear pictures of opportunity for performance improvement, better lift, agility, and maneuverability of a fighter if a model requires a new design.",Fighter,2020

Threat Avoidance Multi-Route Decisions for Air-Strike-Package on   an Operation Network,"Air-Strike-Package consists of multiple fighter planes that carry out the Air-Interdiction-Operation.

The operation is mathematically formulated for the plans of multi-airplane¡¯s path to minimize the total traveling distance and the exposed risk from the Surface-to-Air threats. Each airplane travels along the several arcs from one of the origin candidates to its target, which is restricted to be separated with the other airplane sufficiently.

An Air Combat Decision Learning System Based on a Brain-Like Cognitive Mechanism,"The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged unexpectedly as a new force in the recent local wars. To occupy the high ground of military technology in the future, research on autonomous air combat using UAVs is extremely important. In this paper, we propose an intelligent air combat learning system inspired by the cognitive mechanism of the human brain. The air combat capability was divided into two parts: declarative and procedural memory. Imitating the updating and storage mechanism of human knowledge, a long- and short-term hierarchical asynchronous learning principle was designed. We adopted the basic idea of using the error signal to drive learning according to neurophysiological research. Drawing lessons from the working memory mechanism, the error signal for driving the short-term learning was created in the absence of labelled data, using only the interactive information. Then, we proved that the learning mechanism could ensure that system performance advances steadily and gradually. The experiments illustrated that the learning system designed in this paper can achieve some inferior confrontation ability through self-learning without human prior knowledge. Action strategies formed by learning are analogous to the classical tactical manoeuvres of human fighter pilots. We compared our work with related works and found that our method could improve its performance continuously and finally defeat its opponent.",Fighter,2020

Determining Direction-of-Arrival Accuracy for Installed Antennas by Postprocessing of Far-Field Data,"Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation accuracy can be degraded due to installation effects, such as platform reflections, diffraction from metal edges, and reflections and refraction in the radome. To analyze these effects, this paper starts with a definition of the term installation error related to DoA estimation. Thereafter, we present a postprocessing method, which can be used to determine the DoA estimation accuracy for installed antennas. By computing synthetic signals from the installed far-field data, it is possible to analyze the installation errors described above, in addition to analyzing array model errors. The method formulation is general, thus allowing generic array configurations, installation configurations, and direction-finding algorithms to be studied. The use of the presented method is demonstrated by a case study of a wideband four-quadrant array. In this case study, we investigate the installation errors due to a single-shell radome. Thereafter, the effects of platform reflections are also analyzed, for an antenna placement in the tail of a fighter aircraft.

Advanced Constraints Management Strategy for Real-Time Optimization of Gas Turbine Engine Transient Performance,"Featured ApplicationThe method that is described in this work can be used to assess the gas turbine engine performance under different control modes when the engine experiences transient operation. During this phase of operation, the engine needs to meet all the predefined constraints while it delivers the required performance efficiently and within its operating envelope.Abstract Motivated by the growing technology of control and data processing as well as the increasingly complex designs of the new generation of gas turbine engines, a fully automatic control strategy that is capable of dealing with different aspects of operational and safety considerations is required to be implemented on gas turbine engines. An advanced practical control mode satisfaction method for the entire operating envelope of gas turbine engines is proposed in this paper to achieve the optimal transient performance for the engine. A constraint management strategy is developed to generate different controller settings for short-range fighters as well as long-range intercontinental aircraft engines at different operating conditions by utilizing a model predictive control approach. Then, the designed controller is tuned and modified with respect to different realistic considerations including the practicality, physical limitations, system dynamics, and computational efforts. The simulation results from a verified two-spool turbofan engine model and controller show that the proposed method is capable of maneuverability and/or fuel economy optimization indices while satisfying all the predefined constraints successfully. Based on the parameters, natural frequencies, and dynamic behavior of the system, a set of optimized weighting factors for different engine parameters is also proposed to achieve the optimal and safe operation for the engine at different flight conditions. The paper demonstrates the effects of the prediction length and control horizon; adding new constraints on the computational effort and the controller performance are also discussed in detail to confirm the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach in developing a fully automatic optimized real-time controller for gas turbine engines.",Fighter,2019

Cognitive radars that combine a multitude of well known and new techniques offer a promising solution to these challenges. In this article, the operational scenarios are introduced, and then a high-level functional architecture is presented, before discussing certain aspects of cognitive radars from a user's and manufacturer's point of view.",Fighter,2019
Impact of mission requirements on the design of low observable UCAV configurations,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to characterise the effects of mission and performance parameters on the design space of low observable subsonic unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) operating in typical Hi-Lo-Hi ground strike missions. Design/methodology/approach Conceptual design methodologies appropriate to low observable, tailless UCAVs have been integrated into a multidisciplinary aircraft design environment, GENUS, developed at Cranfield University's aircraft design group. A basic Hi-Lo-Hi mission is designed and a baseline configuration is established through the GENUS framework. Subsequently, an evolutionary optimiser and a robust gradient-based optimiser are used to obtain convergent design solutions for various leading edge sweep angles, mission ranges, cruise Mach numbers and other operational constraints. Findings The results indicate that performance constraints, specifically in the form of specific excess power (SEP), have a large influence on the overall sizing of subsonic tailless UCAVs. This requirement drives the engine sizing, which represents a considerable proportion of the empty and gross mass of the vehicle. Cruise Mach number studies show that no significant advantages exist for operating at low speeds while maintaining performance requirements consistent with combat missions. There is a drastic increase in the vehicle's mass and thrust requirements for flight speeds above Mach 0.8, with low sweep configurations showing a more pronounced effect. Increases in the range are not overly dependent on the leading edge sweep angle. Top-level radar cross section (RCS) results also favour configurations with higher leading edge sweep angles, especially from the nose-on aspect. Finally, research and development costs are shown to be directly linked to engine size. Originality/value This research shows the use of an integrated aircraft design environment that incorporates aerodynamics, performance, packaging and low observability aspects into the optimisation loop. Through this methodology, this study supports the efforts towards characterising and establishing alternate visions of the future of aerial warfare through the use of low cost, survivable unmanned platforms in network-centric cooperative tasks.",Fighter,2019
Binary Stokes vector representation of aircraft in the low-resolution radar context,"This study proposes a low-band scheme utilising the polarisation dominance of the target's resonance regions in the frequency domain to recognise a fighter-sized aircraft. The methodology implements a binary decision tree based on three polarisation power terms, namely Stokes variables, to determine the polarisation dominance of six directions, and subsequently, predict the canonical shape of the target substructures. The decision tree comprises three inequalities of the Stokes variables subject to an orthogonality threshold to reflect the dominant polarisation directions as a function of the target resonance region. The simulation data for two fighter-sized aircraft illustrate the feasibility of the method by comparing the differences (or similarity) in the target decision outcomes. The results indicate that resonance-scattering region lies within the frequency band of 9-200 MHz where thin-wedge scattering is prominent within the frequency band of 9-30 MHz, whereas the corner (dihedral) scattering becomes dominant within the band of 110-170 MHz, mainly when the radar illuminates the target sides aspect. The method was robust to the noise and target aspect change using the paradigms of the MIG29 and F16 aircraft models.",Fighter,2019
Event-triggered composite nonlinear control for saturated systems with measurement feedback,"The composite nonlinear feedback (CNF) control problem with event-triggered strategy for saturated systems with measurement feedback is considered in this paper. Both the full-order measurement and the reduced-order one are investigated to ensure the satisfactory performance of the closed-loop saturated systems under the proposed event-triggered mechanism. Generally speaking, the CNF control is divided into the linear control part and the nonlinear control part, which are designed separately. The purpose of the former is to shorten the rise time, while the latter aims at reducing the overshoot caused by the former. In this paper, a co-design method of linear and nonlinear control parts is proposed such that the control output tracks the reference input asymptotically with a good transient performance. Moreover, the parameter of CNF is applied to the construction of event-triggered mechanism which can efficiently reduce the communication burden. In order to avoid Zeno behavior, the minimum event-triggering time interval is explicitly formulated. Finally, an example of fighter aircraft is given for illustration.",Fighter,2019
Constrained dynamic compensation with model predictive control for tracking,"This article extends the benefits of model predictive control for the linear dynamic compensators commonly designed for aerospace systems. The traditional control structures often used in output tracking are synthesized, and the proposed model predictive control scheme modifies the plant input and reference to be tracked, creating artificial demands and control corrections to guarantee the state and satisfaction of the output constraint. The novel predictive controller, with a related reference governor, is presented with assured closed-loop stability, convergence and recursive feasibility for attainable piecewise constant setpoints along the system operation. The modification of the feasible demands and control inputs enlarges the domain of operation of the constrained closed-loop system. The elimination of the quadratic programming solvers running during real-time operation is also presented to reduce the computational burden. The simulation results using a fighter trainer model are finally shown, illustrating the benefits of the proposed technique. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Fighter,2019
"Investigation of Shock Motion in Transonic Flow Using an Oscillating, Straked, Delta Wing","A computational analysis was performed on a straked, delta wing undergoing pitch motion in order to investigate the influence of shock-induced, trailing-edge separation (SITES) on simulated limit-cycle oscillations (LCO). The research presented herein describes an aeroelastic analysis of a wing oscillating in pitch using Euler-based aerodynamics with boundary-layer coupling (BLC). Results indicate that oscillatory shock movement occurs in response to the pitching motion of the wing, both with and without BLC. However, the BLC solution predicted more significant shock movement, and the inviscid solution predicted more aggressive shocks located further aft on the wing. Increasing the amplitude of the pitch oscillations resulted in a greater range of shock motion than lower amplitude cases, but variation of oscillation frequencies tested did not show any noteworthy differences. These findings support the theory that oscillatory shock movement associated with SITES can occur during certain cases of transonic LCO. In addition, based on the results from pure pitch motion of the wing and on the flow solver used, shock motion can occur without a boundary-layer model, although the modeling of viscous effects does affect the range of shock motion.",Fighter,2019
Adaptive Fuzzy Fault-Tolerant Tracking Control for Partially Unknown Systems With Actuator Faults via Integral Reinforcement Learning Method,"In this paper, a fuzzy reinforcement learning (RL)-based tracking control algorithm is first proposed for partially unknown systems with actuator faults. Based on TakagiSugeno fuzzy model, a novel fuzzy-augmented tracking dynamic is developed and the overall fuzzy control policy with corresponding performance index is designed, where four kinds of actuator faults, including actuator loss of effectiveness and bias fault, are considered. Combining the RL technique and fuzzy-augmented model, the new fuzzy integral RL-based fault-tolerant control algorithm is designed, and it runs in real time for the system with actuator faults. The dynamic matrices can be partially unknown and the online algorithm requires less information transmissions or computational load along with the learning process. Under the overall fuzzy fault-tolerant policy, the tracking objective is achieved and the stability is proven by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the applications in the single-link robot arm system and the complex pitch-rate control problem of F-16 fighter aircraft demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Fighter,2019
Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System and Neck Muscle Activity During Air Combat Maneuvering,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of cervical muscle activity in different head postures when using helmet-mounted display in one fighter vs. two aircraft air combat within visual range (WVR).METHODS: Cervical EMG was measured with eight F/A-18 pilots using the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) during air combat maneuvering. In-flight G(z) acceleration and continuous head position were recorded. EMG activity is divided and presented in a matrix with three-class rotation and five-class flexion-extension postures.RESULTS: The mean muscle activity in sternocleidomastoids and cervical extensors was 28.9% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and 44.8% MVC, respectively. Cervical flexor and extensor muscles are subjected to loading over MVC during high G(z) sorties. Cervical rotation combined with extension exceeded muscle force-producing capacity during high G(z) resulting in a decline in muscle activity.DISCUSSION: Awkward postures, especially rotational ones, are more prone to increase loading over muscles' capacity. Overloading of muscles increases the risk of muscular and ligamentous injury. In addition, the lack of muscular support potentially leads to the G(z) loading being transferred to spinal structures via intervertebral discs and the vertebral column. The JHMCS helmet seems to change the pattern of most loading muscles toward the extensor (posterior) neck muscles.",Fighter,2019

It is ascertained that the SBR method, notwithstanding its numerical simplicity, can provide qualitatively similar and reasonably accurate RCS results for an object of varying complexity.",Fighter,2019
Switching Control Architecture with Parametric Optimization for Aircraft Upset Recovery,"This paper describes a novel finite-state conditional switching structure that enables autonomous recovery for a large envelope of loss-of-control conditions. The switching control architecture mimics human pilot recovery actions through numerous discrete states that are activated individually as the recovery proceeds, based on guidelines inspired by the Federal Aviation Administration's suggestions for piloted upset recovery. The switching conditions between discrete states are optimized using interpolation algorithms that extend the recovery envelope while decreasing the average recovery time. The presented architecture is tested on a high-fidelity transport aircraft model under various initial angles of attack, sideslip and roll angles, and roll/pitch/yaw rates. Comparisons with previous methods are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves a greater recoverability percentage and lower average recovery time. In addition, the proposed switching architecture is implemented on a high-fidelity F-16 model, and an example recovery scenario is given to demonstrate the implementation of our approach for an agile fighter aircraft model.",Fighter,2019
Scaled Demonstration of Fluid Insert Noise Reduction for Tactical Fighter Aircraft Engines,"This paper summarizes a university-industry cooperative project to develop a new method of noise reduction applicable to tactical fighter aircraft engines. There is an acute need for reduction of the noise produced during takeoff in aircraft carriers. This paper describes the fluid insert noise reduction technology, also referred to as ""distributed blowing."" The method involves injection of air through the divergent wall of a converging-diverging nozzle to generate fluid inserts. Substantial noise reductions in small-scale experiments have been achieved for mixing noise in the maximumnoise emission direction and in broadband shock-associated noise. This paper describes the extension of the methodology to moderate-scale experiments conducted in industry. Changes to the original small-scale design for use in the industry-scale model experiments are described. The experiments were conducted in the GE Aviation Cell 41 Laboratory, and noise reductions were achieved that were very similar to those obtained in the small-scale experiments. Changes to the operating parameters produced noise reductions that in some cases exceeded comparable small-scale results. Scaling the moderate-scale experiments to a full-scale aircraft produces reductions in the A-weighted spectral peak that exceed 7 dB in the direction of maximum noise emission.",Fighter,2019
Effectiveness-Based Design of an Aircraft Considering Mission Uncertainties,"This paper proposes a new design exploration methodology, effectiveness-based design (EBD), to incorporate multidisciplinary analysis and design optimization, and uncertainty quantification earlier in the design process. The proposed EBD employs mission effectiveness objectives directly through physics-constrained operational analysis rather than relying on proxies such as aircraft weight, range, or fuel burn over a static mission or group of missions. Surrogate models are leveraged as part of EBD to achieve coupling between physics while being able to efficiently perform uncertainty quantification. Toachieve EBD of anaircraft, amultiparameter performance code that accounts for variable engine features of a numerical and installed numerical propulsion system simulation coupled with a computational fluid dynamics analysis is executed in place of operational analysis. Various surrogate modeling methods are investigated for the approximated representation of the coupled physics, and it is found that the nondeterministic kriging is suitable to produce robust predictions requiring fewer off-design evaluations. To demonstrate the proposed framework, a generic fighter aircraft subject to uncertain flight and combat conditions is assessed through a combat mission.",Fighter,2019
Resonance capture and targeted energy transfer for suppressing aeroelastic instability of 2-D wing,"Numerical simulations were conducted to study flow-induced vibration of a two-dimensional airfoil with two nonlinear energy sinks (NES). The relationship between targeted energy transfer (TET) and vibration suppression is analyzed in detail. The main system has two degrees of freedom - the pitch and heave. The two NES are treated as subsystems, in which the first NES is place at the leading edge and the second NES is placed at the trailing edge. The limit cycle oscillation (LCO), which is to be suppressed by the NES, is studied from the viewpoint of the TET. The resonance capture (RC) in the coupled nonlinear system is also discussed by the means of the energy and spectrum analysis. This is followed by a detailed target energy transfer discussion of the heave and pitch modes and the NES. In addition, the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is utilized to obtain an intrinsic mode function (IMF) to analyze resonance capture in the system. The results show that the NES can absorb vigorous amount of energy from one of the specified vibration modes. As the RC occurs, the TET between the vibration modes in the coupled system becomes more significant. In particular, the TET between the NES and the wing becomes more efficient. This results in an increase in the critical freestream velocity as the NES suppresses the nonlinear vibration of the main system in a very effective way. As the total energy exceeds the suppression range of the subsystem, the NES loses its effectiveness on vibration suppression effect on the main system. The IMF of the EMD exhibits special super-harmonic resonance and frequency competition characteristics.",Fighter,2019
Achieving resiliency in major defense programs through nonfunctional attributes,"This article examines how the ilities, or nonfunctional attributes, help to understand the concept of resiliency in engineered systems. For engineered systems, resiliency describes the ability of a system to react to and return to full function after an interruption to system operation. The literature on resiliency of engineered systems defines resiliency in both the context of mission and platform resiliency; however, it leaves an opportunity to research how to understand, manage, and achieve resiliency. This work proposes an application of the systems engineering ilities to resiliency to understand how systems engineers can account for resiliency in the design process and incorporate resiliency into systems. Quality, robustness, and agility assist in understanding the components of resiliency and the ilities of repairability, extensibility, flexibility, adaptability, and versatility provide means for systems to achieve resiliency. This article applies this framework to examine two cases of DoD systems, the B-52 bomber and the F-117 stealth fighter. These two examples demonstrate how nonfunctional attributes enable engineered systems to achieve resiliency and help to better understand the concept of resiliency in engineered systems.",Fighter,2019
Assisting the Improvement of a Military Safety System: An Application of Rapid Assessment Procedures to the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System,"This article describes an iterative application of Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP) to study human-machine interaction issues with a recently implemented, highly automatic system on the F-16 fighter aircraft known as the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto-GCAS). Auto-GCAS is a sophisticated technology that has the ability to detect an imminent ground collision threat and automatically execute a last-moment maneuver to avoid a crash. We employed RAP methods at multiple United States Air Force and Air National Guard sites in the United States and abroad. Over a three-year period, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 402 F-16 pilots experienced with the system. The method we employed, termed here iterative RAP, is reviewed in detail and evaluated in the framework of Utarini, Winkvist, and Pelto's (2001) eleven criteria for quality RAP studies. Results from this study include assisting in correcting system misunderstandings and anomalies, improving information flow about Auto-GCAS, and contributing towards the perception of military safety systems as valuable. This article concludes by (1) discussing positive effects that iterative RAP can contribute to the defense community and (2) arguing our method's utility towards the study of complex bureaucracies and multi-sited research, particularly following the introduction of new technology or policy.",Fighter,2019
Simulation of active cancellation system based on N-order SSC algorithm,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce the theoretical basis of N-order spectral spreading-compressing (SSC) frequency shift interference algorithm and expand it to active cancellation. An active cancellation simulation and verification system based on N-order SSC algorithm is established and carried out; simultaneously, the absorbing material coating stealth simulation of two kinds of thickness is carried out to compare the stealth effect with active cancellation system. Design/methodology/approach The active cancellation method based on N-order SSC algorithm is proposed based on theoretical formula derivation; the active cancellation simulation and verification system is established in MATLAB/Simulink. The full-size model is built by CATIA and meshed by hypermesh. The omnidirectional radar cross section (RCS) is calculated in cadFEKO, and the results are analyzed in postFEKO. Findings The simulations are implemented on a stealth fighter, and results show that after active cancellation, the peak of spectrum analyzer has reduced in all azimuths, the omnidirectional RCS has also decreased and the detection probability of almost all azimuths has dropped under 50 per cent. The absorbing material coating stealth simulations of two kinds of thickness are carried out, and results show that the stealth effect of active cancellation is much better than absorbing material coating.Practical implications - An active cancellation system based on SSC algorithm is proposed in this paper, and the effect of active cancellation is verified and compared with that of absorbing materials. A new method for the current active stealth is provided in this paper. Originality/value Active cancellation simulation and verification system is established. RCS calculation module, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) calculation module and detection probability module are built to verify the effect of active cancellation system. Simultaneously, the absorbing material coating stealth simulation is carried out, and the stealth effect of absorbing material coating and active cancellation are compared and analyzed.",Fighter,2019
Technical considerations on the Takoradi-Cairo air route of the Second World War,"This paper describes an initiative of the British War Cabinet to procure thousands of aircraft to Egypt during the crucial, central years of the Second World War. The aircraft were sent crated by cargo ships to Takoradi, in the Gold Coast (current Ghana), assembled at an on-purpose facility there, and flown over Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, and Egypt to the Nile Delta, where appropriate Maintenance Units would deliver them later to fighting squadrons. More than 5000 airplanes were dispatched in this way from British harbors, arriving into the Cairo area just a few weeks later. Most aircraft flown in this trans-African route were fighters, which required fully loaded external drop tanks to cover the longest stages, commonly against prevailing trade winds. The convoys were typically formed by a light bomber, as lead aircraft, and six to eight fighters. The aerodynamic characteristics of the fighters have been modelled with first level preliminary airplane design methods, to reconstruct its performances in the route. The results, in terms of range and cruise speed, agree very well with scarce data available from literature.",Fighter,2019
Impact analysis of compressor rotor blades of an aircraft engine,"Frequent failures due to foreign particle impacts are observed in compressor blades of the interceptor fighter MIG-23 aircraft engines in the Ethiopian air force, supplied by the Dejen Aviation Industry. In this paper, we made an attempt to identify the causes of failure and hence recommend the suitable materials to withstand the foreign particle impacts. Modal and stress analysis of one of the recently failed MIG-23 gas turbine compressor blades made up of the following Aluminum based alloys: 6061-T6, 7075-T6, and 2024-T4, has been performed, apart from the impact analysis of the rotor blades hit by a granite stone. The numerical results are correlated to the practical observations. Based on the modal, stress and impact analysis and the material properties of the three considered alloys, alloy 7075-T6 has been recommended as the blade material.",Fighter,2019
Nitrogen Washout and Venous Gas Emboli During Sustained vs. Discontinuous High-Altitude Exposures,"INTRODUCTION: The frequency of long-duration, high-altitude missions with fighter aircraft is increasing, which may increase the incidence of decompression sickness (DCS).The aim of the present study was to compare decompression stress during simulated sustained high-altitude flying vs. high-altitude flying interrupted by periods of moderate or marked cabin pressure increase.METHODS: The level of venous gas emboli (VGE) was assessed from cardiac ultrasound images using the 5-degree Eftedal-Brubakk scale. Nitrogen washout/uptake was measured using a closed circuit rebreather. Eight men were investigated in three conditions: one 80-min continuous exposure to a simulated cabin altitude of A) 24,000 ft, or four 20-min exposures to 24,000 ft interspersed by three 20-min intervals at 8) 20,000 ft or C) 900 ft.RESULTS: A and B induced marked and persistent VGE, With peak bubble scores of [median (range)]: A 2.5 (1-3); B: 3.5 (2-4). Peak VGE score was less in C [1.0(1-2),P < 0.01]. Condition A exhibitedan initially high and exponentially decaying rate of nitrogen washout. In C the washout rate was similar in each period at 24,000 ft, and the nitrogen uptake rate was similar during each 900-ft exposure. B exhibited nitrogen washout during each period at 24,000 ft and the initial period at 20,000 ft, but on average no washout or uptake during the last period at 20,000 ft.DISCUSSION: Intermittent reductions of cabin altitude from 24,000 to 20,000 ft do not appear to alleviate the DCS risk, presumably because the pressure increase is not sufficient to eliminate VGE. The nitrogen washout/uptake rate did not reflect DCS risk in the present exposures.",Fighter,2019
Switched H-2-state-feedback control with application to a fighter aircraft,"This paper proposes two different H-2-state-feedback controller synthesis algorithms for uncertain linear, time-varying, switched systems. The synthesis algorithms are based on a dwell-time approach, which makes use of time-varying parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions. The control laws consist of state-feedback controllers that are switched according to external signals. The proposed synthesis algorithms are then employed to design switched H-2-state-feedback control laws for the longitudinal dynamics of the ADMIRE fighter benchmark model. The results obtained in simulation show the merits of the proposed approach.",Fighter,2019
Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) Plasma Actuators for Flow Control in Turbine Engines: Simulation of Flight Conditions in the Laboratory by Density Matching,"We address requirements for laboratory testing of AC Dielectric Barrier Discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuators for active flow control in aviation gas turbine engines. The actuator performance depends on the gas discharge properties, which, in turn, depend on the pressure and temperature. It is technically challenging to simultaneously set test-chamber pressure and temperature to the flight conditions. We propose that the AC-DBD actuator performance depends mainly on the gas density, when considering ambient conditions effects. This enables greatly simplified testing at room temperature with only chamber pressure needing to be set to match the density at flight conditions. For turbine engines, we first constructed generic models of four engine thrust-classes; 300-, 150-, 50-passenger, and military fighter, and then calculated the densities along the engine at sea-level takeoff and altitude cruise conditions. The range of chamber pressures that covers all potential applications was found to be from 3 to 1256 kPa (0.03 to 12.4 atm), depending on engine-class, flight altitude, and actuator placement in the engine. The engine models are non-proprietary and can be used as reference data for evaluation requirements of other actuator types and for other purposes. We also provided examples for air vehicles applications up to 19,812m (65,000 ft).",Fighter,2019
The effects of flight complexity on gaze entropy: An experimental study with fighter pilots,"We studied the effects of task load variations as a function of flight complexity on combat pilots' gaze behavior (Le., entropy) while solving in-flight emergencies. The second company of the Spanish Army Attack Helicopter Battalion (n = 15) performed three sets of standardized flight exercises with different levels of complexity (low [recognition flights], medium and high [emergency flights]). Throughout the flight exercises we recorded pilots' gaze entropy, as well as pilots' performance (assessed by an expert flight instructor) and subjective ratings of task load (assessed by the NASA-Task Load Index). Furthermore, we used pilots' electroencephalographic (EEG) activity as a reference physiological index for task load variations. We found that pilots' gaze entropy decreased similar to 2% (i.e., visual scanning became less erratic) while solving the emergency flight exercises, showing a significant decreasing trend with increasing complexity (p < .05). This is in consonance with the similar to 12% increase in the frontal theta band of their EEG spectra during said exercises. Pilots' errors and subjective ratings of task load increased as flight complexity increased (p-values < .05). Gaze data suggest that pilots used nondeterministic visual patterns when the aircraft was in an error-free state (low complexity), and changed their scanning behavior, becoming more deterministic, once emergencies occurred (medium/high complexity). Overall, our findings indicate that gaze entropy can serve as a sensitive index of task load in aviation settings.",Fighter,2019
Cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles and its association with muscle strength among fighter pilots: a 5-year follow-up,"Background: A small cross sectional area (CSA) of the paraspinal muscles may be related to low back pain among military aviators but previous studies have mainly concentrated on spinal disc degeneration. Therefore, the primary aim of the study was to investigate the changes in muscle CSA and composition of the psoas and paraspinal muscles during a 5-year follow up among Finnish Air Force (FINAF) fighter pilots.Methods: Study population consisted of 26 volunteered FINAF male fighter pilots (age: 20.6 (+/- 0.6) at the baseline). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were collected at baseline and after 5 years of follow-up. CSA and composition of the paraspinal and psoas muscles were obtained at the levels of 3-4 and 4-5 lumbar spine. Maximal isometric strength tests were only performed on one occasion at baseline.Results: The follow-up comparisons indicated that the mean CSA of the paraspinal muscles increased (p < 0.01) by 8% at L3-4 level and 7% at L4-5 level during the 5-year period. There was no change in muscle composition during the follow-up period. The paraspinal and psoas muscles' CSA was positively related to overall maximal isometric strength at the baseline. However, there was no association between LBP and muscle composition or CSA.Conclusions: The paraspinal muscles' CSA increased among FINAF fighter pilots during the first 5 years of service. This might be explained by physically demanding work and regular physical activity. However, no associations between muscle composition or CSA and low back pain (LBP) experienced were observed after the five-year follow-up.",Fighter,2019
Examination of Factors Related to Pilot Acceptance Behaviors Toward the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System in Fighter Aircraft Operations,"Objective: This research aimed to explore an application of the technology acceptance model (TAM) to integration of the automatic ground collision avoidance system (AGCAS) in fighter aircraft operations to gain a better understanding of the pilots' acceptance behavior with respect to a high-level automated system. Background: AGCAS has been deployed to prevent loss of F-16 fighters from ground collision using a high-level automation design capable of altering the aircraft's flight control system independent of pilot action. Understanding pilots' acceptance behavior with respect to the system could allow future stakeholders to make reasonable inferences about some factors that are important to achieving positive pilot acceptance of highly automated aircraft systems. Method: Using data from a survey of active-duty U.S. Air Force F-16 operational fighter pilots (N = 142), an AGCAS-specific TAM was analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. Results: This study indicated that perceived ease of use had a significant, but only medium-sized relationship with perceived usefulness. The other result was that perceived usefulness has a strong relationship with usage behavior. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the potential utility of a model for technology acceptance tailored to explain user acceptance behavior with respect to a high-level fighter aircraft automated collision avoidance system.",Fighter,2019
Boundary-layer transition of advanced fighter wings at high-speed cruise conditions,"The achievement of laminar flow in the boundary layer at high-speed cruise conditions may further, in addition to shock-wave control, reduce the drag and extend the range of military fighter aircraft. To this end, a further investigation on transitional boundary-layer flow of fighter wings is needed due to different configurations from the wings used on conventional transport aircraft. In this paper, wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations were conducted on three-dimensional transition of thin diamond-shaped wings used on advanced fighter aircraft at tran/supersonic design points. A newly proposed correlation of crossflow transition which includes the effect of surface roughness was introduced into the gamma-Re-theta t transition model. Predicted results were in good agreement with flow visualizations. Results showed that the strength of the crossflow component grew rapidly around the leading edge because of the severe flow acceleration, just as the same as wings with a large aspect ratio. However, there seemed no regular pattern of instabilit-dominance variation in span-wise for a diamond configuration. The dominance of different instability mechanisms strongly depended on the local pressure distribution. Hereby, the research recommended a ""roof-like"" shape of pressure distribution to suppress both crossflow and Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) instabilities. Besides, a sharp suction peak with a serious pressure rise should be cut off to avoid stronger instabilities. Further discussions also revealed an independence of the unit Reynolds number when transition was triggered by T-S instabilities. Aerodynamic force comparisons indicated that further benefit on drag reduction could be expected by including the three-dimensional transition effect into a wing design process.

Integration assessment of conceptual design and intake aerodynamics of a non-conventional air-to-ground fighter aircraft,"The conception of non-conventional aircraft, whose goal is achieving a certain performance or operational improvement is undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges in aeronautical engineering. This work presents the conceptual design of a non-conventional air-to-ground fighter aircraft, whose main design feature is an inverted-rectangular dorsal intake, followed by a three-dimensional transitioning S-duct diffuser with circular cross-section at aerodynamic interface plane. An in-house presizing tool was developed to define the key layout characteristics and select the optimal airframe-engine combination regarding the design requirements, whereas Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations were also conducted to assess the performance of both, the intake-airframe integration and the drag polar of the aircraft at several flight conditions. The results found in this work were evaluated separately. First, the analytic design method of the intake itself was compared with numerical simulations in order to check and maximize the total pressure recovery at the on-design condition. Subsequently, the intake-airframe integration assessment took place, showing that adequate performance and compatibility characteristics are maintained during subsonic and transonic maneuvers. However, at supersonic velocities, there is a flow expansion on the fuselage and wings that reduce the intake performance levels. These studies provided extensive data to evaluate the effects of specific aircraft design variables on dorsal intake performance, such as the integration of the cockpit, the boundary layer diverter, and several delta wing planforms. Results show that dorsal intakes are a promising alternative for aircraft that require only reasonable supersonic maneuverability capabilities and high subsonic and transonic capabilities, such as an air-to-ground fighter aircraft. In addition, dorsal intake coupled to S-duct diffuser provide line-of-sight blockage of the engine blades, satisfying the requirement of low radar signature, lightweight and low drag of the next generation of fighter aircraft.

A new systems engineering structured assurance methodology for complex systems,"As technology advances, systems behaviour becomes more difficult to predict and control, resulting in a lack of systems assurance across the supply chain. Here we describe a structured approach to address the assurance of complex systems developed and operated within highly regulated environments. The new approach is based on a methodology that can address both new and legacy systems, and influences system intervention. We propose an enterprise approach by observing the importance of all organisational contributions to a safe working system throughout the intended project life cycle. This research was catalysed by the need to address the certification of the F-35B stealth fighter for UK operations from 2012 onwards. We offer a pragmatic strategy to achieve systems control by adopting a holistic approach to systems engineering while promoting the development of an enabling environment that can determine system threats and enable appropriate controls. We propose a systematic coordination process to minimise the potential for 'organisational drift'. This holistic approach to systems engineering and assurance is defined as 'systems engineering structured assurance'. The methodology provides a confidence assessment for a particular product or system while remaining agnostic to regulatory constraints. The diligent completion of the methodology increases systems confidence and informs the regulatory environment.",Fighter,2019
Psychophysiological response of different aircrew in normobaric hypoxia training,"Hypoxia remains the most important hazard in high altitude flights, but there is still a need for deeper analysis of the effect of hypoxia exposition in the psychophysiological and cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to study the effect of hypoxia training in cortical arousal, autonomic modulation, muscle strength and cognitive function. We analysed 23 male aircrew personnel of the Spanish Army and Air Force (10 Helicopter Pilots, 7 Transport Aircrew, 3 Transport Pilots and 3 F-18 Fighter Pilots) before, during and after a normobaric hypoxia exposition. Hypoxia produced an increase in perceived stress and effort, a higher Heart Rate and a decreased function of breath muscles. Working memory and pattern recognition were impaired after hypoxia exposition. Significant differences were found in cognitive tests performance among aircrew groups, suggesting differences on their previous training. These results can improve specific training for better preparation of pilots and aircrews for hypoxic threats. Practitioner summary: Distinct aircrew preparation produces a different hypoxia exposition effect on psychophysiological response and cognitive functions. Hypoxia produced an increase in Heart Rate, a decreased function of breath muscles, being more negatively affected in Transport Pilots. Cognition abilities were impaired after hypoxia exposition, independently of the aircrew group.",Fighter,2019
Vortex Dynamics Study of the Canard Deflection Angles' Influence on the Sukhoi Su-30-Like Model to Improve Stall Delays at High AoA,"The maneuverability of the Sukhoi Su-30 at very high angles of attack (AoA) was remarkably appealing. Canard angle, in cooperation with aircraft wing, created a flow pattern whereby, in that position, the fighter still had as much lifting force as possible in order not to stall. The behavior of changing canard angle configuration played an essential role in creating the strong vortex core so that it could delay the stall. The study of vortex dynamics at canard deflection angle gave an essential function in revealing the stall delay phenomenon. In this study, one could analyze the flow patterns and vortex dynamics ability of the Sukhoi Su-30-like model to delay stall due to the influence of canard deflection. The used of water tunnel facilities and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Q-criterion has obtained clear and detailed visualization and aerodynamics data in revealing the phenomenon of vortex dynamics. It was found that between 30 degrees and 40 degrees canard deflection configurations, Sukhoi Su-30-like was able to produce the most robust flow interaction from the canard to the main wing. It was clearly seen that the vortex merging formation above the fighter heads was clearly visible capable of delaying stall until AoA 80 degrees.",Fighter,2019
Analytical Design and Stability Analysis of the Universal Integral Regulator Applied in Flight Control,"This paper considers the analytical design and stability analysis of an output feedback flight control problem for a rigid fighter aircraft which has a highly nonlinear dynamic. In this paper, a robust technique known as Universal Integral Regulator (UIR) has been chosen to solve the tracking problem due to the possibility to demonstrate the stability of the system and analytically compute the control parameters. The UIR is a combination of Continuous Sliding Mode Control (CSMC) and a Conditional Integrator (CI) which provides integral action only inside the boundary layer, enhancing the transient response of the system and providing an equilibrium point where the tracking error is zero. The general procedure consists firstly of rewriting the aircraft dynamics in the control-affine form, then the relative degree of the system is computed and the system is transformed to normal form. An output feedback controller using a CSMC controller is proposed, and a sliding surface considering a CI is designed. The controller parameters are designed analytically, taking into account two approaches. The first approach does not consider uncertain parameters and the second one treats a stability derivative as a parametric uncertainty. Simulations were performed in order to validate the design procedure of the control technique and to demonstrate the robustness of the UIR. Detailed step by step information about the computing of the controller parameters was done and an analytical analysis of stability was developed to demonstrate the convergence of the sliding surface, conditional integrator and tracking error dynamics.",Fighter,2019
Internal flow and external jet characteristics of double serpentine nozzle with different aspect ratio,"In order to increase the survivability of the fighter aircraft, the serpentine nozzle has been applied in series of stealth bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles due to its excellent potentiality of evidently suppressing the infrared radiation signatures and radar cross section emitted by engine exhausts. Among the geometric parameters of the serpentine nozzle, the aspect ratio (AR) at the nozzle exit is one of the most critical parameters for the nozzle design as the infrared suppression effect could be greatly enhanced with the increment of AR by strengthening the mixing between the exhaust plume and atmosphere; the aim of this paper is to study the influence of the AR on the flow characteristics of the double serpentine nozzle. The flow features of six double serpentine convergent nozzles, i.e. AR = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15 respectively, were numerically simulated with the shear stress transport kappa-omega turbulent model adopted, which had been validated by the experimental data. The characteristics of internal flow and external jet, and the aerodynamic performances of these six nozzles were compared. Results show that the Ma contours at the symmetric plane are different due to the distinct flow accelerations caused by the change of the curvature and the duct height for diverse AR, and the surface pressure and the shock wave features are different correspondingly. The lateral divergence and the lateral convergence characteristics of the nozzle configuration lead to opposite lateral flow under diverse AR, and the change of lateral width induced different lateral pressure gradient, then lead to various lateral vortex distributions. The length of potential core is the contribution of the comprehensive effects of geometry parameters, and it is decreased with the increase of AR due to the dominated effect of the increased mixing area; however, the declining rate is slowed down. The AR of 5 should be chosen for the best aerodynamic performance of the double serpentine nozzle under the qualifications to completely shield the high-temperature turbine.",Fighter,2019
A New Assessment Method of the Pilot Stress Using ECG Signals During Complex Special Flight Operation,"With the continuous improvement in the man-machine-designed fighter aircraft, the pilot training intensity has increased. Complex special operation of the fighter aircraft is greatly affected by flight conditions and human control reliability, which imposes a great burden on the pilot psychophysiologically. To understand the intensity of the stress on the pilot, which is a crucial parameter, accurate evaluation of the changes in the stress intensity of the pilot during the flight is very important. This study aimed to analyze the stress intensity of pilots by collecting electrocardiogram (ECG) signals during the long flight involving 11 pilot trainees. First, an improved soft-threshold denoising method for the ECG data and an improved differential threshold method were used to process the first-order difference and the threshold value to the filtered signal to determine the R wave. Then, the multiscale analysis method was used to fuse the area of the heart rate curve of the pilots. The method of flight training and the division of the stress stage were derived. Further, the functional relationship of the stress intensity with the frequency of training was constructed. All these effectively improved the performance of the flight operation training and helped make a reasonable training plan. This was of great practical significance to the measurement and evaluation of the stress state of the individuals in dangerous jobs, such as special flight operations, high-altitude skydiving, bungee jumping, etc.",Fighter,2019
The Optimum Size of ROK Air Force Fighters Responding to North Korea¡¯s Nuclear and Missile Threats: The Fighter Requirement for an Offensive Air Campaign,"This study proposes a model for calculating the appropriate number of fighter jets needed to secure the Republic of Korea¡¯s vital national interests against North Korean military threats including nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The security environment surrounding the Korean peninsula has been dramatically changed by inter-Korean and US-DPRK summit talks. Expectations for peace on the Korean Peninsula have grown among Koreans. However, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will take much longer than most people hope. Meanwhile, the military should be prepared for a war or a conflict against any threats including North Korea. Fighter jets are key to this, having provided crucial deterrence roles. The number of fighter jets will shrink from the current 410 to 310 by mid-2020, however.To develop a formula to ascertain the appropriate number of fighters, we first examine US experiences in the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraqi War in 2003 and utilize the concept of a parallel attack with the strike-package model used in those wars. After key assumptions are presented, this study suggests a formula with two sets of variablestarget-related as well as fighter capability-related variablesand shows how the appropriate number of fighters varies depending on the number of targets in North Korea, the number of sorties per day, the share of stealth fighters in the package, and the extent of US participation.",Fighter,2019
Probabilistic Approach for Fighter Inlet Hammershock Design Pressure,"Inlet hammershock is the critical loads condition for designing the inlet duct structure of a fighter. The sudden flow reduction in engine compressor causes inlet hammershock with high pressure. The traditional method was used to combine extreme conditions (maximum speed, sea level altitude, and cold day) to analyze this compression wave inlet hammershock pressure. However, after the 90s there have been papers that presented the probabilistic approach for the inlet hammershock to achieve the appropriate design pressure. This study shows how to analyze the inlet hammershock pressure by making practical use of the Republic of Korea Air Force real flight usage data under probabilistic approach and then analyze approximately 30% decreased inlet hammershock pressure compared with the traditional valve.",Fighter,2019
Proposal of Detection Module for Fighter Aircraft Data Modulation Attack,"Modern state-of-the-art military aviation assets are operated with independent embedded real-time operating systems(RTOS).These embedded systems are made with a high level of information assurance. However, once the systems are introducedand installed on individual platforms for sustaining operational employment, the systems are not actively managed and as aresult the platforms become exposed to serious threats. In this paper, we analyzed vulnerability factors in the processing ofmission planning data and maintenance-related data for fighter aircraft. We defined the method and form of cyber attacksthat modulate air data using these vulnerabilities. We then proposed a detection module for integrity detection. The designedmodule can preemptively respond to potential cyber threats targeting high - value aviation assets by checking andpreemptively responding to malware infection during flight data processing of fighter aircraft.",Fighter,2019
A Study on the Interoperability of ROK Air Force Virtual and Constructive Simulation,"LVC(Live-Virtual-Constructive) training system is drawing attention due to changes in battlefield situation and the development of advanced information and communication technologies. The ROKAF(Republic of Korea Air Force) plans to construct LVC training system capable of scientific training. This paper analyzes the results of V-C interoperability test with three fighter simulators as virtual systems and a theater-level wargame model as a constructive system. The F-15K, KF-16, and FA-50 fighter simulators, which have different interoperable methods, were converted into a standard for simulation interoperability. Using the integrated field environment simulator, the fighter simulators established a mutually interoperable environment. In addition, the Changgong model, which is the representative training model of the Air Force, was converted to the standard for simulation interoperability, and the integrated model was implemented with optimized interoperability performance. Throughput experiments, It was confirmed that the fighter simulators and the war game model of the ROKAF could be interoperable with each other. The results of this study are expected to be a good reference for the future study of the ROKAF LVC training system.",Fighter,2019
Effects of Strake Shape on the Vortex Pair Interaction of a Double-Delta Wing,"Maintaining flight stability at higher angles of attack is one of the crucial factors in designing modern fighter aircraft. Conventional fighters usually generate two co-rotating vortices, are from the main wing and the after from the strake. These vortex systems merge into a strong vortex as they travel aft, generating beneficial effects such as lift augmentation. However, the merged vortex is more susceptible to vortex breakdown due to its higher rotational velocity, which deteriorates the aircraft performance. This paper investigates the effects of the strake shape on the vortex interaction and the vortex breakdown phenomenon. Both wind tunnel tests and computational analyses were carried out for a conventional strake delta wing and a reversed strake delta configuration, which can generate a counter-rotating vortex pair. The results indicate that the counter-rotating vortex pair accelerates both the interaction and the merging process and delays the vortex breakdown at higher angles of attack. We found that the aerodynamic characteristics and stability performance could be significantly improved by utilizing the variable strake-shape concept.",Fighter,2019
Ranking of most favorable for attack air targets in multi-target tracking mode of the on-board radar,"A variant of ranking of air targets at the stage of short-range guidance (homing) of fighters and multi-functional aircraft is considered using an extreme criterion obtained on the basis of the method of subjective folding of particular indicators by introducing a generalized indicator in which their importance is determined by weight coefficients. The indicators used were: required lead angle, required sight angle for the lead angle and the expected guidance time. The calculated relations for obtaining particular indicators and the method of determining the minimum values used in the criteria of the quality functional are given. The application of the proposed criterion provides a high probability of making the right decision when determining the targets most favorable for attack by all-angle means of destruction, which is due to the fact that it is based on a set of the most informative indicators, and also takes into account the kinematics of the relative motion of the air target and the aircraft at the stage of near guidance.",Fighter,2019
A Novel Radar Signals Sorting Method-Based Trajectory Features,"When several foreign fighters with the same type enter detection range, the electronic warfare (EW) receivers will intercept many the same type radar emitter signals. If the intercepted pulse is processed by the traditional sorting methods, the number of emitters cannot be identified. The main reason is that the same type of radar has similar parameters. It will cause a devastating influence on subsequent strategic decisions. A novel sorting method based on the trajectory features is proposed to solve the aforementioned problems. First, the trajectory features of the intercepted pulse signal are extracted. Then, the segmentation method is utilized to preprocess the signals, which enhances the computing efficiency and improves the sorting accuracy. Meanwhile, a prediction framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is established to forecast pulses. Finally, the radar stagger pulses are sorted by forecast pulses. The simulation results show that the proposed method can recognize the number of emitters and achieve high sorting accuracy. It provides a new idea for the radar signals sorting of the same type.",Fighter,2019
Near to Far Field Transformation Algorithm for RCS Analysis of Large Electrical Objects,"Preliminary analyses of radar cross section (RCS) in the design process of military weapon systems are very important. Recently, weapon systems such as missiles and fighter jets are adapted for large-size electrical objects in preparation for the wavelengths used in radar. Therefore, it is difficult to pre-analyze the RCS through commercial simulation programs unless a high-performance computing power is provided. To solve these problems, we propose a near to far field transformation algorithm that can be applied to domain decomposition analyses. First, we analyzed the theoretical equation and the physical meaning of the algorithm and matricized the integral equation to a constant part and a scattering part. Then, the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse matrix method was used to solve the scattering characteristics. We have also studied the possibility of extracting the far field RCS from near field data.",Fighter,2019
The Research of Unmanned Aircraft Evasive Maneuvers from Attack by Enemy Aircraft on the Basis of the Game Approach,"Actual level of unmanned aerial vehicles development allows us to consider them as an effective tool for solving a variety of civil and military tasks (primarily reconnaissance and strike). At the same time, one of the most important problems associated with the combat use of unmanned aerial vehicles remains to ensure their high survivability in organized counteraction conditions, the source of which can be both ground-based air defense and fighter aircraft (manned or unmanned). For this reason, the study and optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle evasion maneuvers from an enemy air attack remains relevant. In the article on the basis of game approach the algorithm of the unmanned aerial vehicle trajectory guaranteeing management providing its evasion from attack of the air opponent is offered. The study of unmanned aerial vehicle maneuverability tactically significant indicators influence on the effectiveness of the evasion maneuver. The results of simulation, demonstrated the influence of unmanned aerial vehicle maneuvering capabilities on achievement a positional advantage in order to solve the problem of evasion from enemy air attack, are presented. A series of computational experiments, whose results allow to assert that the use of the developed algorithm to guarantee control regardless of the relative initial state target UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and UAV-interceptor with the comparability of their maneuvering capabilities in 73 % of cases provides the positional advantage of the target UAV, the UAV position relative to the interceptor makes inefficient use of the latest posted guided missiles, are performed. Note that the increase in the values of tactical indicators that reflect the maneuverability of the attacked UAV compared to the enemy, leads to the fact that in all cases, regardless of the initial position of the attacked UAV relative to the UAV-interceptor, it is ensured that it is brought beyond the zone of possible launches of guided missiles.",Fighter,2019

Environmental Test Tailoring for Fighter Aircraft Intended for Operating in Korean Peninsula,"Operational failures may occur even though there had been no signs of defect during the manufacturing process, which may be caused due to exposure to environmental stress which had not been addressed properly during the design process. It is thus necessary to perform environmental testing to determine the cause of the failures. Environmental testing is also used to determine whether a materiel has enough tolerance to the environmental stress during its operation. In this study, the method and level for each environmental testing are properly tailored and applied to a fight aircraft intended to operate in ROK (Republic of Korea), based on the MIL-STD-810G Change 1. Since each part of a fighter aircraft may be exposed to each different environment, LRUs (Line Replaceable Units) exposed to similar environment should be tested similarly. In addition, the decision whether to apply specific test and the tailoring technique in test level were derived for natural and induced environments, respectively. As a fight aircraft is assumed to operate in ROK, the tailoring of test methods and test level to fit to the environment in Korean peninsula is necessary. Further research is needed in determining a specific procedure and a specific level in a test method, and also in determining the test sequence, when conducting more than one is needed, because it can alter test results and it hence becomes an essential element in test design.",Fighter,2019
Investigation About the Structural Nonlinearities of an Aircraft Pylon,"The goal of the present work is to develop a high-fidelity nonlinear finite element (FE) model able to describe the mechanical response of an aircraft structure composed of a pylon, sway braces, and a store system with an applied external load. Unstable phenomena (such as limit cycle oscillations) on aircraft pylons have been shown to occur because of the presence of nonlinearities (structural and aerodynamic). Most previous investigations mainly focused on aerodynamic effects while almost neglecting structural effects. The present paper, however, focuses on the building and assessment of a nonlinear FE structural model of a pylon, starting from experimental evidence, showing that nonlinearities are concentrated in the joint between the pylon and the suspended store. The static results of the numerical model were assessed by means of an experimental stiffness test. The dynamical reliability of the model was assessed when linked to a delta cropped wing comparing its vibration modes with experimental values and with a linear model. The results demonstrate that the FE model is able to accurately replicate both the static and dynamic behavior of the system.",Fighter,2019
Monostatic RCS Measurement for Transparent Conducting Oxide Coated Dielectric,"In military weapon systems, the cockpit canopy that occupies a large region of a fighter aircraft requires both high visible light transmittance and Radar Cross Section(RCS) reduction performance. In this investigation, the monostatic RCS of an acrylic dielectric coated with a transparent conducting oxide that can realize high light transmittance and low haze characteristics in the visible spectrum, was experimentally analyzed. To calibrate the RCS measurement, assuming a perfect electric conductor, a conducting plate made of copper was used and the measurement error was minimized by satisfying the far-field condition of the antenna and scatterers. The monostatic RCS of TCO single-sided and double-sided coated samples was measured. As a result, an RCS reduction of approximately 2.9 dB and 7.24 dB, respectively, was confirmed under normal incidence condition, compared to the conducting plate. In addition, RCS variations of each sample were confirmed by measurement performed at 5?¡ã and 10?¡ã oblique incidence.",Fighter,2019
Horizontal Backward Launch Dynamics Modeling and Analysis,"Fighters' air strikes play a vital role in modern warfare. But, with the development of fighters, the amount of bombs will inevitably become a major disadvantage due to the limitations of the invisible design and other functions, so a combination of the old model bombers and the advanced fifth-generation fighters has been proposed. This paper takes the aircraft missile horizontal backward launch system as the research object; firstly, the finite element model of the missile's off-track is established, and the simulation calculation under the fixed platform is tested to verify the correctness of the finite element model. Meanwhile, the simulation parameters of the initial trajectory are obtained. Then, by establishing the separation model of the machine under the open state of the aircraft's rear launcher, the variation of the flow field during the separation process of the missile is analyzed, and the variation of the force and the attitude of the missile is studied. It is found that the pitching motion of the missile is greatly affected by the initial pitch angle, it is always in the heading state during the whole separation process, and the yaw motion is not obvious.",Fighter,2019
LPV/PI Control for Nonlinear Aeroengine System Based on Guardian Maps Theory,"The requirement of fighter's maneuverability puts forward higher indexes for the control performance of aeroengine. It is generally recognized that the proportion integration (PI) control is the most commonly used control method of aeroengine. However, due to the high nonlinearity and performance requirements of aeroengine, the selection of PI parameters needs more accurate methods to satisfy higher performance requirements. In this paper, the linear parameter varying (LPV) model is established according to a nonlinear mathematical model of a turbofan engine. Then, the LPV/PI control based on guardian maps theory is proposed to solve the highly nonlinear aeroengine control problem which improves the response characteristics of aeroengine without changing the control method in the range of the scheduling parameters. In the process of design, a set of controller parameters satisfying the performance requirements is automatically generated by a given initial controller parameter, so designing the controllers at multiple equilibrium points is avoided. Finally, the simulations are performed by the integral separation of PI control at different points in the flight envelope for the nonlinear model. The results illustrate that the control method based on guardian maps theory can contribute significantly to solving the nonlinear problems of aeroengine control system.",Fighter,2019

Unmanned recognition of cracks on the pure titanium bleed air ducts in jet fighter using time various magnetic field analysis,"Bleed air ducts are used in aircraft to de-ice fuselage and to heat the cockpit by transferring engine heat. These ducts are made of titanium tubes and are routed in the airframe. Over long-term operation, cracks may appear in the bleed air duct tubes because of the action of moisture and corrosive gas. Therefore, we proposed an electromagnetic testing system for the nondestructive testing of bleed air duct tubes. An unmanned crack detection algorithm, which based on analysis of electromagnetic field distribution, was developed. In addition, locations of cracks in the circumferential and axial directions of the bleed air duct tube were determined.",Fighter,2019
Suggesting the Direction of Target Symbols Design for Fighter Aircraft Cockpit Displays based on Preference Evaluation,"Fighter pilots are always exposed to various hazardous situations due to the extreme air environment. To reduce theemergency situations of the pilots, high situational awareness required to cope with numerous events. Therefore, tomaintain high situational awareness of pilots, this study suggests the direction of target symbols design for aircraftcockpit displays. To do this, we designed several target symbols based on previous research and technical orders offighter aircraft. Then, we evaluated the preference of target symbol design and identified the coding dimensionswhich had the most influence on the symbol preference by conducting Conjoint Analysis. Finally, we re-constructedseveral symbol designs based on the alterations of the selected coding dimension. we identified the preferred designand related implications through ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). These implications can be used as a guideline fordesigning the symbol of next-generation fighter aircraft.",Fighter,2019
LPV Modeling and Identification of Unsteady Aerodynamics for Fast Maneuvering Aircrafts,"Fast maneuvers at large angles of attack are necessary for modern fighter aircrafts. The aerodynamic coefficients in this situation are unsteady, with the characteristics of hysteresis and fast time-varying. We propose an identification method based on the linear parameter varying (LPV) model. The model takes into account the hysteresis with respect to the angle of attack, and fast time varying with respect to the motion of post-stall maneuvers. By introducing the angular velocity as an exogenous variable, the model can guarantee the tracking ability of fast time-varying variations. We use the instrumental variable least squares (IVLS) algorithm to deal with the estimation problem. Finally, the experimental data obtained from maneuvers at large angles of attack from wind tunnel tests are used to validate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.",Fighter,2019
The Efficient High-Resolution SAR Reconstruction Imaging Algorithms for Three-Dimensional Electrically Large-Scale Targets in Clutter,"In recent years, significant effort of both the scientific and industrial community is invested in research and development of multifrequency, multipolarization, and high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. One of the key issues is to realize efficient methods for imaging, reconstruction, and target detection of three-dimensional (3-D) electrically large-scale objects. In this paper, an advanced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SAR based on high-resolution imaging algorithm was developed. Specifically, a reasonable sea surface model to quantify the influence of physical parameters in clutter was yielded as well. The SAR simulation system includes the following: (i) refined geometric-electromagnetic modeling by Gmsh, (ii) a dynamic sea surface model, (iii) single-input multiple-output (SIMO) radar imaging formation by employing a fast backprojection algorithm, (iv) design of MIMO antenna arrays to achieve a good trade-off between the main beam width and the side lobe level, (v) 3-D SAR imaging algorithm on the basis of optimized physical optics for electromagnetic scattering computation, and (vi) hardware acceleration technique using graphics processing unit.

And then, we scored the security threat in terms of possibility and impact on the fighter. Finally, we determine the security risk severity.",Fighter,2019
A Study on the relationship between body composition and loss of consciousness by G-induced acceleration of preliminary pilots,"The ability of pilots is important for being a high-performance fighter aircraft. In particular, the ability to cope with the acceleration that occurs during a sharp turn in close combat is needed. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between body composition and G-tolerance in 312 preliminary pilots. Body composition measurement and acceleration experiments were administered on the participants and then they were grouped according to their consciousness. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used for data analysis. The results showed that weight(p<.05), fat mass, percentage body fat, and percentage muscle mass were significantly different between LOC group and non-LOC group. The rate of loss of consciousness was low in the group with low fat mass(OR = .175 ~ .381) and percentage body fat(OR = .151 ~ .412), and high percentage muscle mass(OR = .086 ~ .306). G-tolerance was related to fat mass, percentage body fat and percentage muscle mass. In addition, the loss of consciousness was significantly decreased both the body composition was 16.6% or less and the percentage muscle mass was 48.6% or more.",Fighter,2019
Optimal design of fighter aircraft wing panels laminates under multi-load case environment by ply-drop and ply-migrations,"The ply-drop (PD) is termination of specific plies at rib-axis for getting tapered laminates. The present optimization study aims to achieve minimum weight tapered wing panels laminates by PD followed by ply-migrations (PM). The PM are required for ply-continuity (blending) and achieving smooth external aerodynamic surface. A genetic-algorithm mutation operator and fitness based search algorithm is developed in the present study for the optimization. The laminate weight minimization has been achieved as goal of multi-objective optimization (MOO), by utilizing excess design margins of Tsai-Wu first ply failure-index (FI) and wing tip lateral deflection. The finite-element (FE) model of laminate is a set of discrete laminates (chromosomes) between ribs with continuity by virtue of ply-orientations. To select best fit laminate, ply orientations were randomly selected and perturbed for thickness during optimization. The fitness function for evaluating chromosomes is a composite function of multi-objective design requirements and design constraints. The algorithm submits orientation/thickness combinations to ABAQUS/CAE by python-script for function evaluation. The application of algorithm over an initially assumed quasi-isotropic laminate of uniform thickness showed 57% weight reduction for a fighter aircraft's wing panel. The optimization process is automated making PD practically viable in the design process itself.",Fighter,2019
A Novel Antagonistic Weapon-Target Assignment Model Considering Uncertainty and Its Solution Using Decomposition Co-Evolution Algorithm,"The weapon-target assignment (WTA) problem is a crucial decision issue in the process of cooperative aerial warfare (CAW). The decision strategy of fighter teams involved in the CAW is susceptible to the influence of the enemy fire attack and electronic interference, which will lead to both the antagonism and uncertainty of the decision making. In this paper, a novel antagonistic game WTA (AGWTA) model with uncertainty is introduced. The antagonism is described by a non-cooperative zero-sum game model conducted by two fighter teams. Then, a modified sensor data fusion method using belief entropy and similarity of sensor data is presented to manage the uncertainty of AGWTA. According to the characteristics of the AGWTA model, a decomposition co-evolution algorithm (DCEA-AGWTA) is proposed to obtain the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium (NCNE) strategy. The experimental results show that the modified sensor data fusion method contributes to higher reliability of target type identification and the AGWTA model is meaningful in the antagonistic and uncertain situation of CAW. In addition, the DCEA-AGWTA is effective and has a promising ability in finding the closest strategy to the NCNE strategy compared with the other three intelligent evolution-based algorithms.",Fighter,2019
A Study on the Optimal Number of Air Tanker for Patrol Operations,"Air refueling is expected to increase the efficiency of the air force operations. This follows from the introduction of air refueling aircraft, which should to increase operational time by increasing the range and duration of fighter jets. Despite the effectiveness of the air refueling air crafts, the astronomical costs of adapting the air tankers call for careful discussions on whether to acquire any air craft and if so, how many. However there is no academic study on the subject to our knowledge. Thus, we use the ABM(Agent Based Modeling) technique to calculate the optimal number of air tankers during patrol operation. We have enhanced the reliability of the simulation by entering the specifications of the current aircraft operated by the Korean Air Force. As an optimization tool for determining the optimal number of counts, we use OptQuest built into the simulation tools and show that the optimal number of air tanker is 4.",Fighter,2019

Airbrake controls of pitching moment and pressure fluctuation for an oblique tail fighter model,"The pitching moments of a fighter model at an incidence of 32 without and with nine airbrakes are simulated by solving the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The maximum reduction (60.22%) of the total pitching moment is obtained by the airbrake with deflection angle of 60 and length of 0.115 times the wing span. Furthermore, the unsteady flowfields are predicted by the improved delayed detached-eddy-simulation model. The breakdowns of the forebody and strake vortices are advanced, and the flow is blocked by the airbrake, jointly leading to a reduction of the pitching moment. Surprisingly, the pressure fluctuations on the oblique vertical tail are also attenuated due to the existence of the airbrake. A maximum reduction of overall sound pressure level by 11.8 dB is found near the leading-edge on the outer surface of the vertical tail due to the use of the 60T1 airbrake. The bursting vortices from the forebody and strake move towards the symmetry plane owing to the low-pressure region after the airbrake, weakening the unsteady interactions between the bursting vortices and oblique vertical tail.

Bone Conduction as a Viable Alternative to Current Communications Systems in Fighter Cockpits,"INTRODUCTION: Effective voice communication is essential when operating aircraft. Because of the loud operating environment in fighter cockpits, it has been a challenge to provide effective communication while simultaneously protecting the hearing sense. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using bone conducting transducers (BCT) in place of legacy communications systems in fighter cockpits.METHODS: A military flight helmet was modified and outfitted with BCT and air-conducting speakers. BCT were independently tested against air-conducting speakers using a clinical audiometer under three conditions: without earplugs, with earplugs, and with earplugs in the presence of 100-dB broad-spectrum noise. Three test subjects were given an audiological examination using tones of varying intensity ranging from 100 Hz to 8000 Hz The lowest hearable intensity indicated by button press was recorded for each frequency.RESULTS: In the presence of 100-dB ambient noise, bone conducting transducers performed better than air-conducting speakers at all frequencies. Hearability of BCT by audiogram was, on average, 10-20% lower intensity (dB) than air-conducting speakers.DISCUSSION: Currently, USAF pilots wear two layers of hearing protection; i.e., the helmet's integrated earcup and some form of ear plug (e.g., foam earplug or custom-molded earbud). Our results suggest that bone conducting audio transducers may be better for layered hearing protection than air-conducting speakers when used with foam earplugs. Given the cost, complexity, and non-interoperability of custom-molded earphones, helmet-integrated bone conducting transducers and foam earplugs may be a better option for sustained airborne operations.",Fighter,2018
A generic simulation model for prediction of thermal conditions and human performance in cockpits,"This paper presents a computational approach to predict the thermal environment in a cockpit during on-ground and in-flight aircraft operation. A method was developed to model cockpit air temperature, which serves as input to black-globe and wet-bulb temperature computation. Subsequently the simulated temperatures are used to compute common heat stress indices such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), Fighter Index of Thermal Stress (FITS), or Predicted Mean Vote (PMV). To demonstrate the manifold information made available by the computed heat stress indices, WBGT e.g. is set in relation to different types of occupational exposure limits demonstrating not only the possibility to predict physiological constraints but mental performance too. The generic cockpit model and thermal comfort computations were validated against experimental data gained from on ground temperature measurements inside an aircraft cockpit, which underwent a sudden large temperature change. The results exemplify how thermal comfort and possible physical as well as mental degradation of aircrews can be assessed quickly using the presented model.",Fighter,2018
Identification of Volterra kernels for improved predictions of nonlinear aeroelastic vibration responses and flutter,"Aeroelastic structural systems are intrinsically nonlinear and accurate predictions of dynamic responses of nonlinear aeroelastic systems have become of paramount importance since these directly affect the accuracy and reliability of subsequent stability analyses. Such nonlinear systems can be generally represented with Volterra series whose kernels have been found to be effective in their dynamic characterizations. This paper examines how first- and second-order Volterra kernels of nonlinear aeroelastic systems can be accurately identified and then incorporated into the theoretical models of aeroelastic analyses such as predictions of dynamic response and onset of aeroelastic flutter. A novel identification method based on correlation analysis to extract frequency components has been developed which can be applied to general nonlinear aeroelastic systems to obtain accurately the required Volterra transfer functions. The method is very accurate and extremely robust against measurement noise contaminations in both input and output signals, due to the correlation scheme which effectively filters uncorrelated signal components. Detailed aeroelastic behavior of a representative pitch-plunge airfoil dynamic model with nonlinear pitch stiffness has been examined. Its Volterra transfer functions are then identified which are found to be close to their exact analytical counterparts, though interaction between kernels becomes apparent as input level increases. Once inverse Fourier transformed, these identified Volterra kernels are then included in the modeling of the dynamics of aeroelastic systems for vibration response and flutter. Extensive numerical simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed method is very accurate and resilient to measurement errors when applied to the identification of second-order Volterra kernels, and the improvement in predictions of vibration response and flutter become significant when the contributions of these second-order Volterra kernels are included in the overall aeroelastic system dynamics. The identification and subsequent inclusion of second-order Volterra kernels into system dynamics model offer improved design capabilities of nonlinear aeroelastic structural systems.",Fighter,2018
Dynamic surface control design of post-stall maneuver under unsteady aerodynamics,"This paper presents an efficient method that overcomes the problem of the control design of the post stall maneuver under unsteady aerodynamics. On the basis of adequate data of the large amplitude oscillation experiment device in wind tunnel test, the unsteady aerodynamics model with nonlinearity, coupling and hysteresis is established by the improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) method. Considering the nonlinearity of the longitudinal model of the advanced fighter and the aerodynamics characteristics of the post-stall maneuver, the control law under large attack angle is designed combining the backstepping method and the daisy chain allocation method. The first order filter is adopted to prevent the ""differential explosion"" problem. The designed control allocation law guarantees that the conventional surfaces and the vector nozzle deflect coordinately within the position limits and the rate limits. The Radial Basis Function (RBF) network is applied to model the uncertainty, and the stability of the proposed control law which considering the uncertainty is also proved. Digital simulations of the typical ""Cobra"" maneuver under the unsteady aerodynamics are completed with comparisons under different conditions. Simulations results verify the validity of the proposed control law under unsteady aerodynamics and the aerodynamics uncertainty. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",Fighter,2018
Effects of Structural Damage and External Stores on Transonic Flutter Stability,"In this study, the structural damage and external store effects on the transonic flutter stability of a fighter type aircraft are investigated. As the damage area, the control surface-supporting structure has been selected because it is expected to affect the flutter stability sensitively. The transonic small disturbance (TSD) method is used for the analysis of unsteady aerodynamics because it is much faster than other computational fluid dynamics (CFD) schemes and is reliable for considering the control surface motions. The flutter analysis results are also compared with the results using a linear flutter analysis program to demonstrate the reliability of the analysis. This research shows that the flutter stability in the transonic regime can be further reduced after external stores are installed. This study also shows that although there is no significant decrease of flutter stability due to structural damage in subsonic regime, the flutter stability can be seriously deteriorated in the transonic regime at a certain level of damage. The effects of structural damage on the flutter stability should be carefully examined during the development of aircraft especially transonic regime.",Fighter,2018
Development of a Full Mission Simulator for Pilot Training of Fighter Aircraft,"With aircraft becoming more complex and avionics intensive and flight being almost autonomous based on waypoint navigation, software and displays becoming a significant component of the all glass cockpit of the modern day fighter aircraft, it is imperative that pilots are trained on missions using ground based full mission simulator (FMS) for routine flight as well as advanced missions. A flight simulator is as good as the real system only when it is able to mimic the physical system, both in terms of dynamics and layout so that the pilot gets the complete feel of the environment as encountered during actual sortie. The objective of this research paper is to provide a detailed insight into the various aspects of development of a FMS for pilot training with minimal maintenance operations for long hours of realistic flight training on ground.

Recurrent Central Serous Retinopathy with Permanent Visual Loss in a US Naval Fighter Pilot,"Central serous retinopathy (CSR) is a disease process that involves accumulation of serous fluid within the macular retina. This fluid accumulation can temporarily or permanently disrupt vision and in many patients is often a recurrent problem. This case describes recurrent CSR in an experienced U.S. Naval F/A-18 fighter pilot. The patient had been troubled by recurrent CSR for several years which required him to be removed from a flying status. After several episodes and treatment with laser photocoagulation and finasteride, the patient's vision and disease process stabilized, but with permanent defective visual acuity in the right eye. There have been many case reports documenting CSR in active duty military aviators worldwide, including flying pilots who have residual permanent loss of visual acuity; however, this is the first U.S. Naval pilot who has been granted a waiver to return to unrestricted flight status with permanent defective visual acuity.",Fighter,2018
Effectiveness evaluation of fighter using fuzzy Bayes risk weighting method,"Multiple Attribute Decision Analysis (MADA), known to be simple and convenient, is one of the most commonly used methods for Effectiveness Evaluation of Fighter (EEF), in which the attribute weight assignment plays a key role. Generally, there are two parts in the index system of MADA, i.e. performance index and decision index (or label), which denote the specific performance and the category of the object, respectively. In some index systems of EEF, the labels can be easily obtained, which are presented as the generations of fighters. However, the existing methods of attribute weight determination usually ignore or do not take full advantage of the supervisory function of labels. To make up for this deficiency, this paper develops an objective method based on fuzzy Bayes risk. In this method, a loss function model based on Gaussian kernel function is proposed to cope with the drawback that the loss function in Bayes risk is usually determined by experts. In order to evaluate the credibility of assigned weights, a longitudinal deviation and transverse residual correlation coefficient model is designed. Finally, a number of experiments, including the comparison experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) data and EEF, are carried out to illustrate the superiority and applicability of the proposed method.",Fighter,2018
Flow Characteristics of Double Serpentine Convergent Nozzle With Different Inlet Configuration,"Serpentine nozzles have been used in stealth fighters to increase their survivability. For real turbofan aero-engines, the existence of the double ducts (bypass and core flow), the tail cone, the struts, the lobed mixers, and the swirl flows from the engine turbine, could lead to complex flow features of serpentine nozzle. The aim of this paper is to ascertain the effect of different inlet configurations on the flow characteristics of a double serpentine convergent nozzle. The detailed flow features of the double serpentine convergent nozzle including/excluding the tail cone and the struts are investigated. The effects of inlet swirl angles and strut setting angles on the,flow,field and performance of the serpentine nozzle are also computed. The results show that the vortices, which inherently exist at the corners, are not affected by the existence of the bypass, the tail cone, and the struts. The existence of the tail cone and the struts leads to differences in the high-vorticity regions of the core flow. The static temperature contours are dependent on the distributions of the x-streamwise voracity around the core flow. The high static temperature region is decreased with the increase of the inlet swirl angle and the setting angle of the struts. The performance loss of the serpentine nozzle is mostly caused by its inherent losses such as the friction loss and the shock loss. The performance of the serpentine nozzle is decreased as the inlet swirl angle and the setting angle of the struts increase.",Fighter,2018
Fuzzy Bayes risk based on Mahalanobis distance and Gaussian kernal for weight assignment in labeled multiple attribute decision making,"Attribute weight assignment plays a key role in multiple attribute decision making (MADM). For the issue of labeled multiple attribute decision making (LMADM), the existing methods of attribute weight determination that have been well developed for MADM usually ignore or do not take full advantage of the supervisory function of labels. As a result, the weights produced by these methods may not be ideal in practice. To make up for this deficiency, this paper develops an objective method based on Bayes risk. Specifically, the LMADM problem is first put forward, then a Gaussian kernel based loss function is proposed to cope with the drawback that the loss function in Bayes risk is usually determined by experts. Meanwhile, Mahalanobis distance and fuzzy neighborhood relationship are employed to measure the fuzziness of data set.

Computational Study of Aeroelastic Limit Cycles due to Localized Structural Nonlinearities,"Aeroelastic systems including all-moving control surfaces and aircraft wings with stores may experience limit cycling caused by nonlinear structural and/or aerodynamic mechanisms. These systems are examined here via two different and complementary models, with nonlinear wing-root and nonlinear wing-store attachments, respectively, subjected to linear potential flow aerodynamic forces. Limit-cycle responses are obtained through an efficient computational method based on harmonic balance by using the spatially localized (hence mathematically separable) nature of the assumed nonlinearities. Results pertaining to a cubic hardening or softening restoring force in stiffness or damping, freeplay, and Coulomb friction are discussed along with confirmatory time-marching responses for selected cases. Clear relationships are established between the linear flutter behavior and the limit-cycle responses corresponding to each nonlinearity. Overall, this work provides an improved understanding, as compared to prior work, of the beneficial and/or detrimental effects of various localized nonlinearities on the aeroelastic response of all-moving control surfaces and store-carrying aircraft wings.",Fighter,2018
Experimental Survey Regarding the Dangerous Chemical Compounds from Military Polygons that Affect the Military Health and the Environment,"Activities specific to the military field, regarding the instruction process or the missions in the operating theatres, require military personnel to be exposed to a series of toxic chemical compounds, with effects ranging from short to long term. European legislation regarding environmental protection and employee health has become stricter and it directly influences the choice of materials that will be turned into ammunition. Most energetic materials from ammunition contain compounds whose synthesis and decomposition involves the release of high toxicity products into the environment. Shootings with classical weapons systems have an effect on the environment, in the shooting area and also in the place of impact with the objective, having both direct (the shock wave that results from the ammunition exploding, shrapnel, sound waves, high temperatures) and indirect (unexploded ammunition, contamination of the environment) effects. This paper presents the results of experimental research conducted in military shooting ranges during the testing of diverse smoke ammunition, in order to detect and identify the released chemical compounds, thus studying their impact on the fighters' health and security and evaluating the risks they pose on the environment.",Fighter,2018

Jet Engines - The New Masters of Advanced Flight Control,"ANTICIPATED UNITED STATES CONGRESS ACT should lead to reversing a neglected duty to the people by supporting FAA induced bill to civilize classified military air combat technology to maximize flight safety of airliners and cargo jet transports, in addition to FAA certifying pilots to master Jet-Engine Steering (""JES"") as automatic or pilot recovery when Traditional Aerodynamic-only Flight Control (""TAFC"") fails to prevent a crash and other related damages [1-42]. Replacement of propeller driven air vehicles with jet engines marks the first jet-engine historical revolution. Yet designers of TAFC still a priori arrest jet engines to provide only brute force forward - a practice leading to wrong freezing of wings, tails, canards, landing gear, airframe and avionics prior to selection of off-the-shelf jet engine to fit that non-integrated design. A second jet-engine revolution is currently in. It originated by failures of TAFC to function and prevent catastrophes especially in post-stall flight domains, takeoff and landing, which mark the JES-Revolution. Full scale JES implementation started in 1986 in the U.S. by YF-22 design [24, 31-34]. Three years later the YF-22 prototype was selected over the YF-23 that lacked IPA-78402 JES Technologies [31] like 60 + to 1 kill-ratio advantage during WVR air combat - a revolution gradually followed by RUSSIA, CHINA, INDIA, JAPAN and South KOREA [20, 21, 28]. Civilizing JES tomaximize future passengers flight safety by preventing various airlines catastrophes [8] had been successfully first flight tested by a subscale JES-Boeing-727 under U.S. FAA support [ 8, 25]. Pro and cons of military vs. civil JES-technologies are presented by this editorial.",Fighter,2018
Modeling and game strategy analysis of suppressing IADS for multiple fighters' cooperation,"This paper addresses the problem of suppression of the integrated air defense system (IADS) by multiple fighters' cooperation. Considering the dynamic changing of the number of the nodes in the operational process, a profit model for the influence of the mission's cost for the whole system is developed for both offense and defensive sides. The scenario analysis is given for the process of suppressing the IADS by multiple fighters. Based on this scenario analysis, the modeling method and the specific expression for the payoff function are proposed in four cases for each node. Moreover, a distributed virtual learning algorithm is designed for the n-person and n-strategy game, and the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (MSNE) of this game can be solved from the n x m x 3-dimensional profit space. Finally, the simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the game algorithm.",Fighter,2018

La actividad electrod¨¦rmica de la piel como indicador de activaci¨®n psicofisiol¨®gica en pilotos de caza espa?oles: un estudio preliminar,"SUMMARY Introduction: The electrical response of the skin is a mechanism related to the activation of the nervous system. The measurement of this activity in pilots is possible today thanks to innovative devices which could determine the psychophysical effort made. Aim: To measure the Skin Electrodermic Activity during real and in simulator flight from pilots of F18 of the Ala 15 of the Spanish Air Force. Thus, it will be analyzed the feasibility of using these new devices as real-time psychophysiological activity meters, to compare this activation in real flight with respect to flight in simulator and to analyze those real flight phases that request more activation resources.

Comparison of Flow Field Simulation of Liquid Ejector Pump using Standard K-epsilon and Embedded LES Turbulence Modelling Techniques,"The flow field analysis of a liquid ejector pump is important for its design improvements, performance estimation and understanding of mixing and entrainment phenomenon. Ejector pumps, due to their simpler design and ease of maintenance are used in a variety of industrial applications. The subject pump, under consideration in this study, is used for transferring fuel from one fuel tank to another in a fighter aircraft. To study the underlying flow field characteristics of subject ejector pump, the fluid domain is simulated using Embedded LES turbulence modelling technique in Ansys Fluent (R) environment. The flow field and performance parameters of subject pump are then compared with that of previously researched study of same pump wherein Standard K-epsilon RANS Turbulence Model was used. It is revealed that the results obtained using Embedded LES are much closer to experimental data than that of Standard K-epsilon. The limitations of RANS turbulence model for accurate simulation of complex flow field of subject pump are then identified, analyzed and discussed in details by studying the flow characteristics such as Reynolds shear stresses distribution, Potential Core estimation and turbulent viscosity modelling, obtained using both turbulent models.",Fighter,2018
Low-Frequency Eddy-Current Testing for Detection of Subsurface Cracks in CF-188 Stub Flange,"The vertical stub flanges on the CF-188 Hornet fighter aircraft are responsible for linking two vertical stabilizers to the fuselage. Repeated stresses due to dynamic loads on aircraft structure during flight may cause eyebrow cracks on the flange around fastener holes. Prevention of failure of the flange structure involves early detection before cracks grow to a critical length. Low-frequency eddy-current (LFEC) techniques have been applied to inspect thick conducting aircraft structures. However, in the case of the stub flange, LFEC is challenged by component geometry. In particular, the surface containing cracks is not parallel to the surface that is accessible for scanning. The bolts are perpendicular to the face with cracks but are almost at 85 degrees to the scanning surface. A novel conical probe is designed to use the bolt as a core for the excitation (driver) coil, thereby increasing driving flux density, and to constrain probe positioning as it is swept around the bolt. Finite-element simulations are used to investigate influence of different parameters on LFEC impedance plane response. These include slope of the slanted surface, sample thickness, operating frequency, crack size, and edge effect for two different component edge shapes. Experimental measurements carried out at different frequencies on test samples, prepared with the same dimensions as actual flanges, were found to be in good agreement with computational models. Results indicate that LFEC is significantly affected by surrounding geometries, which therefore, need to be taken into account when inspecting for cracks.",Fighter,2018
Failure investigation of pure titanium bleed air ducts in jet fighters,"This paper describes the failure investigation of in-flight failures of bleed air ducts in jet fighters. Severe rupture had occurred at the bleed air duct during the flight that had caused the emergency landing situation. The tubular duct was manufactured using commercially pure titanium. An inspection revealed that all cracks occurred in the central portion of the bleed air duct. Examination of the fractured surfaces by using electron microscopy revealed that cracks initiated at multiple corrosion pits in the inner surface of the duct and these propagated by brittle cleavage cracking with occasional areas of fatigue striations induced by in-service cyclic pressure. Fractography, chemical analysis, and metallographic analysis confirmed that brittle fracture involved the ingress of hydrogen into a duct surface. The hydrogen effectively decreased the ductility of the duct which contributed to brittle fracture. The final destructive rupture of the duct can be explained by fracture mechanics. The critical crack size and stress induced by conditions at or near the operating load were estimated based on computational fracture analysis to explore the fracture mechanism. As a consequence, a novel nondestructive inspection method has been developed to prevent such failures in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Fighter,2018
Effect of pitch down motion on the vortex reformation over fighter aircraft,"The aerodynamic characteristics of a realistic aircraft undergoing high amplitude pitching motions ranging from angle of attack 0 to 80 are studied using a combination of delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) method and experimental approach with reduced oscillation rates kappa = 0.036, 0.054 and 0.072. According to the DDES-based results and experimental data, it is confirmed that asymmetric vortex structure reformation process can be induced by pitch down motion when sideslip angle beta = 0 degrees thereby leading to abrupt and substantial increases in both dynamic normal and side forces. In addition, the effect of pitching frequency on the asymmetric vortex redevelopment is also studied, it will be suppressed with the increase of the oscillation rate, and the bubble and spiral modes are observed to dominate the left and right vortex breakdown process respectively on the left and right upper surface.

Optimal pressure comfort design for pilot helmets,"With the development of high-performance fighters, the function of pilot helmets is also constantly upgrading, and helmet-mounted display (HMD) has become a future development trend. To solve the inter-restriction between the eye position control and the pressure comfort under high overloads of pilot helmets, this paper optimizes the helmet design by building a head-helmet finite element model: (1) Under a 10G overload, the deformation of helmet soft liner should not exceed 2mm; and (2) The combination of liner materials used in various areas should satisfy the requirements of most comfortable head pressure distribution (P-front: P-top: P-side: P-back=2:2:1:3). The study on 46 different combinations of materials finds that the helmet can meet both the eye position maintenance requirement under overloads and the requirement of comfortable pressure distribution when linear elastic materials with Young's modulus of 1000pa, 55000pa and 65000pa are used for the side, top and front parts of the head, and nonlinear elastic hyperfoam material with two-fold stress variation is used for the head back area.",Fighter,2018
Use of quantitative integral indices in the integrated assessment of the tolerance of the flight composition of overloads in a centrifuge,"The efficiency of integral indices in the estimation of adaptive reactions and the tolerability of phase-increasing overloads in a centrifuge in 103 pilots of fighter aviation was analyzed. By background data heart rate in the pre-start period, 3 groups were formed - with average (n=62), elevated (n=16) and low (n=25) indicators.

This study illuminates the next research questions under the premise that the policy making of military weapon system acquisition is experiencing changes in the extension of political, economic, social, and cultural openness. Here are some examples of the changes. First, does the model of military-industry complex and the Iron Triangle have exactness for explaining policy making process per military weapon system acquisition programs? Second, why did the KF-X program stay in the pool of policies experiencing disputes over fourteen years, though the president¡¯s public announcement and technological and scientific indexes were presented? The results of this study are as follows. First, although the KF-X had been started within the ¡°Iron Triangle¡± model at first, the program turned into a ¡°policy community¡± due to participation from expert research groups conducting feasibility analysis of program promotion at the phase of exploratory development, and later on appeared as an ¡°Issue Network¡± model as various actors including academia, mess media, and the netizens participated in the policy making process. Second, actors participating in policy making had cooperative and conflicting interactions through sharing and competing over policy ideas, and the difference in policy ideas suggested by the expert group intensified and strengthened the conflicts between government actors. Hence, the actors¡¯ discussion activities gradually became more complex and developed into an acute competition, and this became the main agent costing a long period of time, along with policy network transitioning to be open, for policy making.",Fighter,2018
An autonomous aerial combat framework for two-on-two engagements based on basic fighter maneuvers,"Unmanned combat aerial vehicles are expected to assist human pilots or to perform autonomous aerial combat in the future. Previous research studies on autonomous aerial combat often have limitations due to overly simplifying assumptions, heavy computational loads, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel autonomous aerial combat algorithm with high-performance and real-time calculations based on basic fighter maneuvers for gun-based engagement within visual range. From the perspective of energy maneuver, which is the core concept of basic fighter maneuvers, we analyzed the flight envelope and maximum maneuvering point of a fighter jet model using the velocity-load factor and energy-maneuver diagrams. We designed a score function and matrix for situation assessment based on combat geometries, enabling cooperative maneuvers and role assignment. By performing gun modeling and target prediction based on the maneuvering plane, the impact point for gun shooting was obtained. The performance of the designed algorithm was validated through not only Monte-Carlo simulations with various initial conditions, but also engagements with another algorithm for comparison, and evaluation sessions by an Air Force combat instructor in a real-time simulation environment using virtual reality goggles and X-Plane.

Further, the results of the suite are compared with the flight data. The predicted body rates and Euler angles of missile compare well with the flight data.",Fighter,2018
Unveiling modal parameters with forced response using SVD and QR during flutter flight testing,"This article presents an algorithm for the identification of modal parameters during flutter flight testing when forced excitation is employed and the aircraft possesses several sensors for structural response acquisition. The main novelty of the method, when compared with other classical modal analysis methods, is that the analysis is carried out in intervals of time instead of in the whole duration of the excitation. It means that, even when the response signal is only partially available, some modal parameters may be still identified. Application to analytic signals as well as structural response of modern fighter aircraft using frequency-swept excitation is provided in order to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and noise immunity of the proposed method.",Fighter,2018
Improved Ant Colony Optimization for Weapon-Target Assignment,"Weapon-target assignment (WTA) which is crucial in cooperative air combat explores assigning weapons to targets with the objective of minimizing the threats from those targets. Based on threat functions, there are four WTA models constrained by the payload and other tactical requirements established. The improvements of ant colony optimization are integrated with respect to the rules of path selection, pheromone update, and pheromone concentration interval, and algorithm AScomp is proposed based on the elite strategy of ant colony optimization (ASrank). We add garbage ants to ASrank; when the pheromone is updated, the elite ants are rewarded and the garbage ants are punished. A WTA algorithm is designed based on the improved ant colony optimization (WIACO). For the purpose of demonstration of WIACO in air combat, a real-time WTA simulation algorithm (RWSA) is proposed to provide the results of average damage, damage rate, and kill ratio. The following conclusions are drawn: (!?cmd??1) the third WTA model, considering the threats of both sides and hit probabilities, is the most effective among the four; (!?cmd??2) compared to the traditional ant colony algorithm, the WIACO requires fewer iterations and avoids local optima more effectively; and (!?cmd??3) WTA is better conducted when any fighter is shot down or any fighter's missiles run out than along with the flight.",Fighter,2018
The studies on optimal shape forming of a turbo-ramjet engine as a part of a high-speed aircraft power plant,"Recently, the great attention is payed in many countries to the studies aimed at flight cruising speed increase of aircraft of various purposes. The projects aimed at considering the issues creating both passenger (Aerion AS2, QueSST, Sky-lon) and military (SR-72) high-speed aircraft are in full swing abroad. The similar studies on building-up the flight speed of military planes are carried out in Russia too. Thereupon, the possibility of developing prospective Russian fighter-interceptor based on MiG-31 aircraft, which speed should substantially increased, presents undoubted interest. The same applies to an attack high-speed aircraft of the type of the Soviet T-4 scout bomber, or the US XB-70 ¡°Valkyrie¡± strategic bomber with maximum flight speed, corresponding Mach number no less than M = 3. The article presents the results of the study on the power plant optimal shape based on the turbo-ramjet engine with tandem configuration of the high-speed aircraft contours with cruising speed of M<sub>cr</sub> = 4. To solve the stated problem, the software complex consisting of mathematical models of the combined engine, including gas-turbine and direct-flow circuits, supersonic air intake and a full-range jet nozzle, as well as the technique for the aircraft performance characteristic computing. The developed program complex allowed evaluate the efficiency of such combined power plant application as a part of an aircraft with increased cruise speed.

Development of System Simulation Environmentfor Design and Verification of Fighter AESA RADAR,"This paper proposes the model-based M&S environment of a fighter AESA radar at system level for the purpose of simulation and verification of the radar system operation.

Development and Evaluation of Control Allocation for the Highly Maneuverable Fighter Aircraft,"Most of the highly maneuverable fighter aircraft such as F-18 Super Hornet, F-35 JSF(Joint Strike Fighter) and F-22 Rapter with a large number of actuators will require advanced CA(Control Allocation) methods to compute the actuator commands needed to achieve a specified set of vehicle accelerations while respecting system constraints. There are many different types of control architectures that utilize a control allocation methodology such as DMI(Dynamic Model Inversion) control or MFC(Model Following Control) that generates a set of desired acceleration outputs based upon aircraft's specific response characteristics. This paper addresses a control allocation method by redistributing control command to the redundant control surfaces based on DMI control architecture.

Fuel Flow Topology and Control for Extending Aircraft Thermal Endurance,The effect of fuel flow topology and control on the thermal endurance of aircraft that use fuel as a heat sink was explored. Differential equations were derived that describe the behavior of recirculated fuel flows within a proposed dual-tank topology that features a designated recirculation tank. Equations for single-tank flow topology are also presented. It is shown that a simple switching controller acting on a dual-tank system results in aircraft thermal endurance that is greater than or equal to that of a single-tank configuration when the aircraft engine and fuel system are driven at a constant mass flow rate. More sophisticated examples are considered for a fighter aircraft mission where the endurance achieved by both open- and closed-loop single-tank systems are compared to the endurance of a dual-tank system operating under closed-loop control. Simulation results are used to quantify benefits that can be obtained by a judicious selection of closed-loop control strategy and fuel flow topology. The results show that a controlled dual-tank fuel topology can increase aircraft thermal endurance over that which can be attained by a single-tank fuel flow topology.,Fighter,2018
An Improved Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III Method for Solving Multiobjective Weapon-Target Assignment Part I: The Value of Fighter Combat,"Multiobjective weapon-target assignment is a type of NP-complete problem, and the reasonable assignment of weapons is beneficial to attack and defense. In order to simulate a real battlefield environment, we introduce a new objective-the value of fighter combat on the basis of the original two-objective model. The new three-objective model includes maximizing the expected damage of the enemy, minimizing the cost of missiles, and maximizing the value of fighter combat. To solve the problem with complex constraints, an improved nondominated sorting algorithm III is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, a series of reference points with good performances in convergence and distribution are continuously generated according to the current population to guide the evolution; otherwise, useless reference points are eliminated. Moreover, an online operator selection mechanism is incorporated into the NSGA-III framework to autonomously select the most suitable operator while solving the problem. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to a typical instance and compared with other algorithms to verify its feasibility and effectiveness. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to the multiobjective weapon-target assignment problem, which effectively improves the performance of the traditional NSGA-III and can produce better solutions than the two multiobjective optimization algorithms NSGA-II and MPACO.",Fighter,2018
Improved design and performance analysis of counterflow thrust vectoring technology under high subsonic,"With the development of aviation technology and the scramble for air supremacy is becoming increasingly fierce, people put forward higher requirements on the performance of the fighter.

An Aircraft-Mission Assignment Model Considering Modular Engine Lifetime Management,"This article proposes an Aircraft-Mission Assignment (AMA) model, considering the operational environments for military aircraft and the conception of aircraft engine lifetime management. The engine is a critical component that enables the airplane to perform its fundamental function, and is used for a specified lifetime and then reused through a renewal process, that is, depot maintenance (DM). Furthermore, the military holds the spare engines for the operation of airplanes during the depot maintenance period of the engines, and the requirement has been computed by considering the mean and uncertainty of the repairing period. Thus, the uniformity of DM times contributes to the reduction of the spare engines and stable operation of the fighters, and it can be enhanced by keeping the amount and time-interval of entered engines uniformly through managing the lifetime consumption of the engines. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to suggest a decision-making model for employing the fighters efficiently so that the residual lifetimes of the engines could be distributed according to a control line established for lifetime management. Moreover, considering the real environments of aircraft operation, an example is developed, and the suitability and effectiveness of this study have been verified by a simulation that the military performs air operations for several days.",Fighter,2018
NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF THERMAL FLOW FIELD ACCORDING TO SHAPE OF EXHAUST NOZZLE OF UCAV AND JET ON/OFF,"To reduce the IR signal of UCAV, geometrically deformed nozzles are often used in the propulsion system. However, the application of deformed nozzles can significantly affect the after-body shape of the flying vehicle, which may cause unexpected changes in the drag and thrust. In this study, the flow field of an unmanned combat fighter with a shape deformed nozzle in flight was analyzed using a CFD code. Special emphasis was placed on the effects of shape-deformed nozzle on the drag coefficient and thrust. In the case of shape deformed nozzle, the deformations of the nozzle affected the local flow field near the nozzle exit of aircraft and, as a result, induced a low drag coefficient, compared to the conventional axisymmetric nozzle. On the other hand, it was shown that the result in the thrust showed no significant difference, thanks to the smooth shape of deformed nozzle.",Fighter,2018
Passive control of transonic flutter with a nonlinear energy sink,"Among different control approaches, the nonlinear energy sink has been proposed as an effective strategy for passive flutter control toward expanding the flight envelope of aircraft. We validate and introduce the capability for coupling the NES within OpenFOAM to simulate and evaluate its usability in controlling transonic flutter. Particular attention is paid to the extent to which variations in the parameters of the sink impact regions of complete and partial suppression. The results show that in the region of complete suppression the nonlinear energy sink may cause the wing to assume a new equilibrium position, in terms of mean value of the oscillations. In the region of partial suppression, the response is dependent on the initial conditions that may lead to multiple pitch and plunge frequencies or potentially a chaotic response.",Fighter,2018
Pelvic Organ Prolapse in a Fighter Pilot with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency,"BACKGROUND: Few researchers have studied symptomatic younger to middle-aged women with pelvic organ prolapse. The association between highly strenuous activity and prolapse symptoms is largely theoretical. It is also known that a genetic component likely contributes to early-onset pelvic organ prolapse, but prevention and treatment with respect to this has not been explored. Service restrictions differ for active duty women who are diagnosed with symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 33-yr-old Gravida 1 Para 1 fighter pilot who developed symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse after a vaginal delivery. Her prolapse symptoms initially prevented her from flying due to exacerbation of pain and pressure. Her exam demonstrated Stage III pelvic organ prolapse. She was treated with a course of physical therapy and ring with support pessary which allowed the patient to return to flight status after 5 mo. After completing the course of physical therapy, her physical exam improved to Stage II pelvic organ prolapse. A few months later, the patient reported that distracting vaginal pain recurred with the highest G forces. Coincidently, the patient was also diagnosed with pulmonary sequela of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and disqualified from flight status.DISCUSSION: This case illustrates the capability of decreasing pelvic organ prolapse with conservative measures, even in extreme environments, but it also identifies a possible association between an elastase activity defect and susceptibility to pelvic organ prolapse.",Fighter,2018

Development of the Model-/Sensor-Based Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion Control Technique for Highly Maneuverability Fighter,"This paper evaluates the flying qualities and stability of the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) control law, in which angular acceleration is analyzed by a mathematical model or measured by an angular acceleration sensor based on the T-50 Advanced Supersonic Trainer model. The NDI has been considered the suitable nonlinear control technique for fighter aircrafts in aerospace industries, since it replaces nonlinear characteristics with the user-defined desired dynamics by inverting the original plant dynamics. To obtain the angular acceleration of the aircraft, two approaches are considered in this paper: estimating from the analytic model (model-based) or measuring from the angular acceleration sensor (sensor-based). To evaluate the robustness of the model-based or sensor-based NDI, the sensitivity analyses with model uncertainties and wide Center-of-Gravity (CG) travel situations are considered. The evaluation results of flying qualities and stability show that the sensor-based NDI considerably degrades the stability margin and pitch equivalent time delay compared with model-based NDI. However, it has the advantages of decreasing the inter-axes coupling effects and improving the robustness throughout the overall flight envelope.",Fighter,2018
A Study on Longitudinal Control Law Design and Flying Quality Parameter Optimization for Highly Maneuverable Fighter,"Flight control law design aims to determine the optimal flying qualities and ensure the stability of aircraft for all mission task elements (MTE) over the entire flight envelope. Numerous control law design criteria offer guidance in the control law development process, and representative aircraft design criteria are presented in MIL-STD-1797 and MIL-DTL-9490E. This paper describes three design methods to optimize flying quality parameters in INDI (Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion) control based on the T-50 Advanced Supersonic Trainer aircraft model. In the first method, flying quality parameters are optimized to meet the flying-quality as a design goal. In the second method, flying quality parameters are optimized to have flying quality and stability margin, such as the gains and phase margins, as a design goal. In the last method, a lead-compensation filter is added at the feedback stage of the angular acceleration to improve the stability margin and then, flying quality parameter is re-optimized with the above second optimization method. The results of the design and evaluation show that the second and third optimization methods are better than the first, achieving level 1 flying quality and guaranteeing the aircraft¡¯s stability.",Fighter,2018
Azimuth Accuracy of Correlative Interferometer Direction Finder on Airborne Scale-down Model,"This paper describes the azimuth accuracy of correlative interferometer direction finder on a scaled down airplane model. When the antennas are placed on the bottom of an airplane, reflection signals caused by an aircraft structure are arise and caused an azimuth error. In this paper, the F-16 fighter scale-down model was made to 5:1, and five antennas were placed on the bottom of the model. The accuracy was made by numerically analyzing the phases of the radio waves received by the five antennas when the signal of emitter was transmitted on 0-360o azimuth angles. The azimuth error of the correlative interferometer direction finder on the model was measured to be less than 1.0o when SNR was larger then 3dB, and it could be very useful for the design of the direction finder on airplane.",Fighter,2018
Tendencies and Prospects on Quantum Radar Systems,"Recently, research and study on the development of 6th generation fighter aircraft have been actively discussed, mainly in the US, Europe, and China. Accordingly, the next-generation radar system, which is regarded as a key component of the 6th generation fighter aircraft, has been also discussed. In particular, the advanced target detection and stealth detection capabilities of quantum radar systems announced in the Chinese press opened up the possibility of a quantum radar system as the next generation radar system.Quantum radar extends the concept of conventional radar systems and detects targets based on the transmission and reception of quantum states of photons.Accordingly, it can detect targets with a relatively small number of photons, enable to provide neutralization of stealth and electronic warfare techniques and enhanced security. Therefore, in this paper, we review the research trends of quantum entanglement, which is the core of various quantum technologies, and then review quantum illumination, a key element of quantum radar systems. Based on the theoretical and experimental results of quantum illumination studied up to now, we analyze the technical advantages and implemental difficulties of applying quantum illumination to radar systems.",Fighter,2018
Analysis of Tracking Accuracy with Consideration of Fighter Radar Measurement Characteristics,"This study analyzes the tracking accuracy(tracking errors) of fighter radar. Measurement error, detection failure, and radar cross section(RCS) fluctuation in radar measurements degrade the measurement quality and hence affect the tracking accuracy. Therefore, these radar measurement characteristics need to be considered when analyzing the tracking accuracy. In this paper, a method for analyzing the tracking accuracy is proposed; this method considers the detection error, detection probability, and RCS fluctuation.Results from experiments conducted with the proposed method show that the detection probability and RCS fluctuation affect tracking accuracy.",Fighter,2018
A Fast Computation Method of Far Field Interactions in CBFM for Electromagnetic Analysis of Large Structures,"The characteristic basis function method, or CFBM, is one of the representative electromagnetic methods widely used today. In this paper, we propose an accelerating algorithm for the far field interaction calculation of CBFM, to efficiently analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of arbitrarily large structures. To effectively analyze the electromagnetic characteristics of a large structure, it is essential to shorten the computation time. In the CBFM analysis method, the complexity can be greatly reduced by using approximations created via the multipole expansion method. The new algorithm proposed in this paper is applied to the computation of radar cross sections of conductor spheres and fighter aircraft, and it is confirmed that calculation time is reduced by 34 % and 74 %, respectively, without loss of accuracy compared with existing CBFM.",Fighter,2018
Dynamic Determination of Optimal Number of Spare Engines through Feedback of Operational Information for KFX/FX Fighters,"Through the KFX/FX project of the air force, a large number of engines will be required and secure of proper number of spare engines serves a significant role in maintaining combat readiness. Currently, all the fighters and engines are acquired at one time but military administration does not have additional procurement processes during operation period. In this paper, we presented a scheme dynamically updating spare engine requirements during operation period. We first reviewed current procedures exercised by US and Korean air forces with engine manufacturer for required number of spare engines. We developed a simulation program dynamically adjusting spare engine requirements through a feedback incorporation of operation information. At the end of each year, the program checks the performance measure and proceeds to next year when a higher result than the threshold set is recorded. Otherwise, additional engine(s) is added to the current number. Through a repeated process over the life cycle, it is seen that the proposed approach generates more realistic results appropriately avoiding undesirable situations.",Fighter,2018
Nonlinear dynamics and SDRE control applied to a high-performance aircraft in a longitudinal flight considering atmospheric turbulence in flight,"Modern high-performance aircrafts operate in regular flight regimes, in which the non-linearities of the system directly influence the dynamical response of the aircraft. This work studies the dynamics of a fighter aircraft operating at high angles of attack of the wing. A mathematical model was developed deriving a system of nonlinear dynamical differential equations representing the longitudinal flight of the aircraft, considering the effect of the variation of the wind speed due to the atmospheric turbulence in the dynamic response of the aircraft. The dynamics of the aircraft is modeled as a two-degrees-of-freedom system, and the variation of the wind gusts is considered as a single-degree-of-freedom system. The analysis of the behavior of the system is carried out through the 0-1 test method to determine if the system is chaotic or periodic, which is applied in relation to the speed and angle of attack of the aircraft. As an object of study, all the considerations and analyses regarding the F-8 aircraft ""Crusader"" were took into account. A control technique is proposed in a nonlinear way, at which the angle of tail deflection is considered as a control parameter and projected using the method of control of the State Dependent Riccati Equations (SDRE) in order to stabilize the wing angle oscillations, considering critical regions of the behavior of the aircraft. Numerical simulations demonstrated the efficiency of the SDRE control, taking into account the comparison of the dynamics of the system with and without control, by using phase planes and parametric uncertainties, where the controller showed to be able to respond quickly and reliably to recover the aircraft from a stall situation.

The Development of an Ordinary Least Squares Parametric Model to Estimate the Cost Per Flying Hour of 'Unknown' Aircraft Types and a Comparative Application,"The development of a parametric model for the variable portion of the Cost Per Flying Hour (CPFH) of an 'unknown' aircraft platform and its application to diverse types of fixed and rotary wing aircraft development programs (F-35A, Su-57, Dassault Rafale, T-X candidates, AW189, Airbus RACER among others) is presented. The novelty of this paper lies in the utilization of a diverse sample of aircraft types, aiming to obtain a 'universal' Cost Estimating Relationship (CER) applicable to a wide range of platforms. Moreover, the model does not produce absolute cost figures but rather analogy ratios versus the F-16's CPFH, broadening the model's applicability. The model will enable an analyst to carry out timely and reliable Operational and Support (O&S) cost estimates for a wide range of 'unknown aircraft platforms at their early stages of conceptual design, despite the lack of actual data from the utilization and support life cycle stages. The statistical analysis is based on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, conducted with R software (v5.3.1, released on 2 July 2018). The model's output is validated against officially published CPFH data of several existing 'mature' aircraft platforms, including one of the most prolific fighter jet types all over the world, the F-16C/D, which is also used as a reference to compare CPFH estimates of various next generation aircraft platforms. Actual CPFH data of the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) have been used to develop the parametric model, the application of which is expected to significantly inform high level decision making regarding aircraft procurement, budgeting and future force structure planning, including decisions related to large scale aircraft modifications and upgrades.",Fighter,2018
An Experimental Study of Features Search under Visual Interference in Radar Situation-Interface,"As was found through information interface analysis of target search in fighter radar situation environment, there are many of visual attention problems caused by complex environment and features, which generate visual interference. This paper extracts the interference environment of situation interface and the feature of information matter as the major factors, also and adopts the interference environment, featured items and quantity as three variables to conduct the experimental study on simulation of the feature search fighter information identification. The experimental results showed that the information identification under low and high interference environments revealed to a significant difference. Due to the high interference environment formed by various information presented in the radar situation-interface, only if being forcibly free from interference could the pilots be able to realize the information identification precisely. Three features, i.e., regular shape-single color, irregular shape-single color and irregular shape-hybrid color, presented a trend of progressive increase of reaction time, which suggested that irregular shape-hybrid color was the difficult cognition and the long reaction time. The eye movement data also suggested that the target search under high interference environment displayed the longer fixation time, more saccade counts and longer scan path, than under low interference environment. In addition, the first saccade time, the total fixation time and saccade counts of featured items search presented an increasing trend, which is the same as reaction. Therefore, the colors and shapes of featured items exerted a remarkable influence to the judgment of objects target. In conclusion the interference environment and the information matter features both have played the important roles in influence of the information identification in the radar situation-interface. The environment and the features are the design factors, which needed for consideration in the information layout of the complex situation-interface. Thus, a conclusion provides a design guideline to the rational layout and improvement of the complex information interface.",Fighter,2018
Nonlinear dynamics and control of a laterally mass varying fighter aircraft,"This paper presents dynamic analysis and nonlinear control of laterally mass varying combat aircraft based on a six degree-of-freedom model derived for a variable mass system. The objective is to investigate the effects of asymmetric lateral mass variation, due to mass ejection, from two different perspectives - the open loop dynamic behavior through bifurcation analysis; and the closed loop control performance while carrying out some demanding maneuvers. Bifurcation analysis reveals considerable coupling between the longitudinal and lateral-directional channels even for a modest lateral shift in the center-of-mass due to store ejection, which in turn is observed to give rise to a spiral-dive like divergent mode even at low angles-of-attack. Thereafter, the well-known high angle-of-attack cobra maneuver is implemented for the symmetric center-of-mass case using sliding mode control technique and using a new single loop control formulation in contrast with the conventional inner-outer loop formulation. The proposed single loop control formulation is further extended to handle the lateral movement of center-of-mass due to asymmetric store ejection using the asymmetric dynamics model proposed and derived in this paper.",Fighter,2018
"Reasons for triple-funding of the jet-engine-industry to meet 2020-2040 6TH-Gen-Challenge: Counter-Air Penetration, CAP","The forthcoming 2020-2040 6TH-Generation is characterized by a host of debated and confused CASLAP-strategies, doctrines, tactics, mission definitions, jetonautic-funding, systems-of-systems technologies vis-a-vis AOOF-based- prop-swarm-technologies and almost symmetric jetonautics at both sides, [Part-A references 5,10,11,17,20,24,26,32,36,48,49].

Failure investigation of in-flight separation of afterburner nozzle flap in a turbojet engine,"A turbojet fighter experienced a separation of the afterburner nozzle flap during flight. Three mounting bolts were intended to fasten the nozzle flap assembly, but complete fracture of these bolts was the primary reason of failure. One of them was lost during the incident and two shank parts of the mounting bolts remained in the engine component. Laboratory investigation of the failed components of the nozzle flap assembly indicated that the mounting bolts were improperly installed during the last maintenance. Detailed fractographic study and metallurgical analysis focused on the fractured bolts and revealed fatigue striations with an overload dimple morphology in all fractured surfaces of the bolts. The investigation established sufficient evidence of improper installation of the primary flap assembly due to deformation of the alignment hole which inevitably resulted in higher operational loads on the bolt. It is concluded that the missing bolt had failed first, and other bolts fractured in succession in the manner of fatigue fracture. In response, preventive measures regarding inspection strategy have been improved to avoid similar failures.",Fighter,2018
Design and Analysis for a Three-Rotational-DOF Flight Simulator of Fighter-Aircraft,"Most of researchers focused on traditional six degrees of freedom (DOF) Stewart flight simulator, which can not be adaptive in fighter-aircraft flight simulator. A three rotational DOF flight simulator of fighter-aircraft based on double parallel manipulator and hybrid structure is presented. The flight simulator is composed of two identical 3-RRS (revolute-revolute-spherical) spherical parallel manipulators and one cabin, called Twins. The cabin has an additional independent DOF for 360A degrees continuous rotation, so it can be applied as a flight simulator for a fighter-aircraft to achieve spin maneuvering. Because of the introduction of the hybrid structure and double parallel manipulator of the mechanism, the redundancy exists with respect to both kinematics and actuation. Kinematics is carried out and Jacobian matrix is established by means of screw theory. The inverse kinematics is given out by the analytical method. 64 groups inverse solutions are showed in a table by permutation. Forward kinematics is solved by an effectively numerical method. The forward numerical method is realized based on the analytically inverse kinematics and Jacobian matrix. The numerical examples show that the forward numerical method can be used in real-time control. The rolling motion is considered in forward kinematics and a numerical example is given out. The proposed flight simulator can spin and there are three rotational DOF with a hybrid structure so that the novel flight simulator can be used in the field of the fighter-aircraft for pilots to train.",Fighter,2018
Creep-fatigue damage simulation at multiple length scales for an aeroengine titanium alloy,"Aeroengine titanium alloys such as Ti-6Al-4V experience creep-fatigue loading conditions during the critical fighter aircraft operations. To ensure and enhance the reliable application of such alloys, mechanical behaviour across multiple length scales need renewed attention. Hence, in the present investigation, an attempt has been made to study creep-fatigue damage across multiple length scales (microstructure to component level) using damage mechanics methodology for Ti-6Al-4V alloy. This involves ambient creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue experimentation; identification of various parameters for creep and fatigue models; developing a creep-fatigue model and finally application of this model for damage simulation at specimen, component and microstructure levels. At specimen level, creep-fatigue damage has been obtained from simulations and compared with experimental values. A very good comparison has been observed for the applied maximum peak stress range of 925-975 MPa. The creep-fatigue model has also been successful in mapping damage and identifying critical damage locations in component as well as in the microstructure.",Fighter,2018
Computational Analysis of Integrated Engine Exhaust Nozzle on a Supersonic Fighter Aircraft,"A unique approach of analyzing jet exhaust nozzle integrated to aircraft and propulsion system is presented in this paper. Engine exhaust nozzle is usually omitted in Wind Tunnel Testing and numerical analysis of aircraft due to complexities involved in integration of nozzle and presence of high pressure / temperature inside exhaust nozzle. Also, the flow properties are non-uniform and highly turbulent in the vicinity of nozzle. Therefore, exhaust nozzle is usually analyzed in isolation and these results often lead to inaccuracies from actual scenario where nozzle is integrated with aircraft and its propulsion system. This research aims to integrate engine exhaust nozzle on a supersonic fighter aircraft and analyze its flow characteristics and variation in performance parameters due to its integration. Engine propulsion characteristics and parameters such as nozzle inlet temperature and total pressure have been analyzed through an in-house validated engine analytical model developed by some of the authors of this study. In the first part of paper, exhaust plume structure has been analyzed to study the flow behaviour (flow turbulence and flow distortion etc) at nozzle exit. Later, nozzle performance parameters such as Exit Velocity, Nozzle Pressure Ratio (NPR), Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR), and Engine Temperature Ratio (ETR) have been calculated when exhaust nozzle is integrated with the aircraft. Finally, the results are compared and validated with analytical calculations to compare the performance of nozzle when it is in isolation and when it is integrated on aircraft. It is observed that nozzle flow has no significant effect on aircraft major surfaces such as fuselage, wing upper and lower surfaces, and nose section. However, there is a prominent effect of exhaust nozzle flow on horizontal stabilizers, vertical tail and rear fuselage area of the aircraft. An average difference of 18% in NPR, 12% in EPR, and 9% in ETR is observed between integrated nozzle and isolated nozzle which further signifies the importance of integrating exhaust nozzle in aircraft analysis. This proposed methodology will allow more accurate analysis of the effects of exhaust nozzle on the overall performance of aircraft. The methodology can further be used for proposing design changes in existing nozzle configurations.",Fighter,2018
Numerical simulation of impact loading for reinforced concrete wall,"Safety assessment methods for evaluating the effect of an aircraft impacting a reinforced concrete (RC) structure at a nuclear power plant are required. The damage behavior of an RC wall during aircraft impact would be simulated by finite element analysis (FEA). A model for simulating an aircraft and the RC used in the walls of a concrete structure should be established before an impact simulation is conducted. However, many concrete models are usually installed in commercial FEA codes. In this study, concrete models were investigated, and a model that is appropriate for simulating experimental fracture behavior was suggested. Validation of the concrete model was confirmed by conducting simulations of quasi-static and impact loading. The material properties of concrete models were identified from experimental results of previous literature. The applicability of a concrete model for quasi-static loading and impact loading were investigated by comparing the experimental results. First, quasi-static simulation of an RC beam specimen is subjected to a three-point bending load. The load-displacement curve and damage behavior of an RC beam specimen was compared with the experimental result. Next, impact simulations were conducted of a F4 fighter engines (GE-J79) missile impacting into three different wall thicknesses of 900, 1150, and 1600 mm and then compared the damage to the wall in the simulation with the experimental results conducted at Sandia National Laboratory around 1990. The results of simulated load and damage behavior of the RC beam specimen and the damage behavior of the RC walls agreed with the experimental results. The concrete models can be used to simulate the damage behavior on an RC wall subjected to impact loading.",Fighter,2018
Generalised Probabilistic Control Design for Uncertain Stochastic Control Systems,"In this paper a novel generalised fully probabilistic controller design for the minimisation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the actual joint probability density function (pdf) of the closed loop control system, and an ideal joint pdf is presented for a linear Gaussian uncertain class of stochastic systems. A single layer neural network is used to approximate the probability density function of the system dynamics. The generalised probabilistic control law is obtained by solving the recurrence equation of dynamic programming to the fully probabilistic design control problem while taking into consideration the dependency of the parameters of the estimated probability density function of the system dynamics on the input values. It is shown to be of the class of cautious type controllers which accurately minimises the value of the Kullback-Leibler divergence without disregarding the variance of the model prediction as an element to be minimised. Comparison of theoretical and numerical results obtained from the F-16 fighter aircraft application with existing state-of-the-art demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Fighter,2018
Finite-time sliding mode and super-twisting control of fighter aircraft,"The development of two nonlinear robust higher-order flight control systems for roll-coupled maneuvers of fighter aircraft with uncertain parameters is discussed in this article. The objective is to independently control the output variables (roll angle, pitch angle and sideslip angle) using aileron, elevator and rudder control surfaces. For a nominal model of aircraft, first a finite time stabilizing (FTS) control law, based on the notion of geometric homogeneity, is designed. Then for robust control in the presence of parameter uncertainties, (i) a discontinuous sliding mode (DSM) control law and (ii) a super-twisting (STW) continuous control law is designed. It is shown that in the composite closed-loop system consisting of either (a) the FTS and DSM control laws or (b) the FTS and STW control systems, the output trajectory tracking error and its first-order derivative converge to the origin in finite time. Digital simulation results for a swept-wing fighter aircraft, including the two composite control systems, are obtained. These results show that each of the designed flight controllers accomplishes precise simultaneous large longitudinal and lateral maneuvers, despite uncertainties in the aerodynamic and inertia parameters, turbulence, and partial loss of control surface effectiveness.

A Comprehensive Survey of Control Strategies for Autonomous Quadrotors,"Over the past several decades, there has been a constant increase in the use of unmanned aircraft systems (UASs). Hence, there has also been a growth in the number of control algorithms to service many applications embodied by these vehicles. Initially, UASs were made popular by the military for reconnaissance, intelligence, surveillance, and target acquisition (RISTA) applications. Nowadays, UASs are used for everything from crop surveys to tourism. Nowhere is this more evident than with a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This paper presents a survey of control methods for multi-rotor systems, namely quadrotors. In doing so, we hope to visualize a clear path to what additional capabilities might be needed in the future.

We also summarize the basic literature definitions and control strategies for autonomous quadrotors.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
MILP Formulation for Aircraft Path Planning in Persistent Surveillance,"Persistent surveillance systems using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles play a crucial role in modern intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. One of the crucial aspects that determine the quality of these systems is path planning. Path planning often attempts to optimize one or two objective metrics, such as coverage area, cost, or time, while meeting several constraints that would challenge these missions, such as weather, downtime, and amount of information gathered. A number of approaches have been proposed in the literature to address the path planning problem. However, the majority of these approaches are often based on a single objective measure, such as minimizing cost, maximizing travel distance, or maximizing coverage time. In cases where combined measures are considered, the formulations are often nondeterministic polynomial-time hard, leading to solutions that are computationally intractable. In this article, a mixed integer linear programming model with two conflicting objective functions-namely, maximizing coverage area and coverage time, has been developed. We propose a two-stage method to handle missions that involve multiple periods, multiple vehicles, and multiple dispersed areas while meeting a number of operational constraints, such as refueling and downtimes. Evaluations based on a number of simulated, yet realistic, scenarios show that our formulation leads to very promising outputs and performance.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
A Consensus Approach for Estimating Tropical Cyclone Intensity from Meteorological Satellites: SATCON,"A consensus-based algorithm for estimating the current intensity of global tropical cyclones (TCs) from meteorological satellites is described. The method objectively combines intensity estimates from infrared and microwave-based techniques to produce a consensus TC intensity estimate, which is more skillful than the individual members. The method, called Satellite Consensus (SATCON), can be run in near-real time and employs information sharing between member algorithms and a weighting strategy that relies on the situational precision of each member. An evaluation of the consensus algorithm's performance in comparison with its individual members and other available operational estimates of TC intensity is presented. It is shown that SATCON can provide valuable objective intensity estimates for poststorm assessments, especially in the absence of other data such as provided by reconnaissance aircraft. It can also serve as a near-real-time estimator of TC intensity for forecasters, with the ability to quickly reconcile differences in objective intensity methods and thus decrease the uncertainty and amount of time spent on the intensity analysis. Near-real-time SATCON estimates are being provided to global operational TC forecast centers.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Application of ground vibration testing in small manned or unmanned aircraft prototyping,"The article describes the vibration measurement technology used in experimental investigation of light aircraft and some series of exemplary results obtained during the prototyping process. The aim of investigations presented herein was to determine the resonant frequencies and natural modes of an aircraft or its selected structural components. Ground vibration testing is an essential dynamic structural test necessary to carry out before the aircraft certification. This test should be performed on the aircraft example which is predicted to be tested in flight. The measuring system used for ground vibration testing in the Institute of Aviation Technology of the Military University of Technology consists of a multi-channel LMS SCADAS analyzer, a set of piezoelectric accelerometers, two vibration exciters equipped with impedance heads and a computer with the Test.Lab Software. The aim of the article was to present the methodology of performing ground vibration testing tests. Having applied the equipment to measure an airplane or its airframe component, key vibration characteristics corresponding to specific resonant points can be determined. Not only completed aircraft can be tested but also its isolated fragments (wings, stabilizers, tail units) or just empty airframe. Testing separately supported components allows examining their aeroelastic properties at early stage of prototyping. Ground vibration testing technology applied in various stages of the prototyping process was demonstrated in four peculiar research cases. The testing examples presented herein were the following: the isolated strut-braced wing of a light reconnaissance airplane, the light drone imitating an aerial target for some on-ground anti-aircraft artillery sets, the empty airframe of a very light jet and the miniature UAV. Some exemplary results obtained from testing these objects were presented. At the end, some observations and conclusions were noted in the context of usefulness of conducted researches.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2021
Selection of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles by Using Multicriteria Decision-Making for Defence,"The unmanned systems have been seeing a significant boom in the last ten years in different areas together with technological developments. One of the unmanned systems is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are used for reconnaissance and observation in the military areas and play critical role in attack and destroy missions. These vehicles have been winning more features together with developing technology in todays world. In addition, they have been varying with different features. A systematic and efficient approach for the selection of the UAV is necessary to choose a best alternative for the critical tasks under consideration. The multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approaches that are analytic processes are well suited to deal intricacy in selection of alternative vehicles. This study also proposes an integrated methodology based on the analytic hierarch process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate UAV alternatives for selection process. Firstly, AHP, a MCDM method, is used to determine the weights of each critical factor. Subsequently, it is utilized with the TOPSIS approach to rank the vehicle alternatives in the decision problem. Result of the study shows that UAV-1 was selected as the most suitable vehicle. In results, it is seen that the weights of the evaluation criteria found by using AHP affect the decision-making process. Finally, the validation and sensitivity analysis of the solution are made and discussed.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Image Motion Compensation Control Technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Airborne Photoelectric Reconnaissance Platform,"Airborne photoelectric platform has a wide application prospect in the field of imaging, especially in the field of UAV reconnaissance. However, in the process of image acquisition, the photoelectric platform equipment will produce obvious image shift because of its own attitude change or speed instability, so it is necessary to compensate the collected image. In this study, when the image motion compensation is carried out, the internal and external parameters of the camera are adjusted, and the geometric model of the image is established. The Camera Calibration Toolbox provided by MatLab is used to calibrate the internal parameters of camera. At the same time, when obtaining the camera's internal parameters, the corresponding flight attitude angle is obtained with the aid of the inertial navigation system. At the same time of acquiring the attitude of the aircraft by hardware, it is necessary to obtain the image shift coefficient by using the function. The coordinate system needs to be transformed into a coordinate system suitable for the inertial navigation system, so as to facilitate the calculation of external parameters of the camera. The transformation matrix from image moving image to normal image can be established by obtaining the parameters inside and outside the camera. Through bilinear interpolation, the matrix is derived in MatLab environment. In the experiment, 16 black-and-white grid images are selected to obtain the attitude angle, so as to complete the calculation process of the conversion matrix. Then, the images with image shift are screened out from the images taken in aerial state. The method proposed in this study is used for image compensation. According to the root mean square error analysis, the image compensation scheme proposed in this study is helpful to the imaging application of UAV airborne platform.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Calling from the cockpit,"The open cockpit of a World War I biplane was not exactly conducive to easy conversation. Intense noise, vibration, and often-violent air disturbances drowned out the crew's voices. The muscles of the face had trouble retaining their shape. Yet the clear benefits of timely aerial reconnaissance stimulated wartime research into wireless telephony, to allow pilots to communicate with one another and the ground. During the summer of 1915, Charles Prince, an engineer and officer in the British Royal Flying Corps, successfully tested the first air-to-ground voice communication at Brooklands Aerodrome. Three years later, Prince's team unveiled the throat microphone [below], which when used with the aircraft's radio telephony transmitter allowed pilots to talk hands free, keeping their hands on the stick and their eyes on the sky.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Two-UAV trajectory planning for cooperative target locating based on airborne visual tracking platform,"Two-unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) cooperative target locating based on airborne visual tracking platform is a common UAV reconnaissance mode. In the process of two-UAV cooperative target locating, the performance of target locating is highly dependent on UAV trajectory. In this Letter, a trajectory planning method for two-UAV cooperative target locating is presented. Using the line-of-sight (LOS) targeting property of the airborne visual tracking platform, in combination with the azimuth angle and elevation angle of the measured LOS, a locating error model is established, which can reflect the correlation between the target locating error and LOS angle error. Then an objective function based on minimising the target locating error is built, which is used as an index of two-UAV trajectory planning. This method can be applied in two-UAV trajectory planning for cooperative target locating and the simulated results confirm that it works effectively.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
A Moving Target Defense Control Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems,"This paper considers the problem of efficiently and securely controlling cyber-physical systems that are operating in uncertain, and adversarial environments. To mitigate sensor, actuator attacks, and performance loss due to such attacks, we formulate a secure control algorithm that consists of a proactive and a reactive defense mechanism. The proactive mechanism, which is based on the principles of moving target defense, utilizes a stochastic switching structure to dynamically and continuously alter the parameters of the system, while hindering the attacker's ability to conduct successful reconnaissance to the system. The unpredictability of the current actuator and sensor is optimized using an information entropy measure, which is induced by probabilistic switching. The reactive mechanism on the other side, detects potentially attacked components, namely sensors and actuators, by leveraging online data to compute an integral Bellman error. A rigorous mathematical framework is presented to guarantee the stability of the equilibrium point of the closed-loop system, and provide a quantified bound on the performance loss when utilizing both reactive and proactive mechanisms. Simulation results show the efficacy of the proposed approaches on a benchmark aircraft model.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020

Characteristics of Multifunctional Unmanned Aircraft by the Ward`s Method,"An important characteristic when creating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is their classification. UAV complexes (KBLA) are among the most high-tech objects of new technology and their improvement is in progress. This article discusses various approaches to the classification of existing multifunctional UAVs. One of the promising areas for the development of modern multifunctional airborne aircraft is the development of reconnaissance-strike and strike UAVs. At the same time, it is noted that a stable classification for the UAV class has not yet been developed. The studies carried out using the methods of mathematical analysis showed that the take-off mass of a UAV can be taken as the main estimated indicator. On the basis of clustering by the Ward's method, a classification of reconnaissance-strike and strike UAVs is proposed, consisting of four classes in the range of 1000...25 000 kg.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Analysis of charts of directional and bi-static scattering of unmanned aerial vehicle linear antenna arrays with reduced radar visibility,"Using the method of induced currents to calculate fields of an object with axial symmetry, an electro-dynamic model was built and analysis of radiation and scattering of electromagnetic waves was carried out by arrays of elementary electric vibrators located on the side surface of an ideal conducting cylinder of finite length. The studies were carried out in the interests of developing methodological bases for the construction of unmanned radio-electronic complexes intended for operation in conditions of protection against radar reconnaissance facilities. Low-profile antenna systems have small weight and size indices and when placed on board slightly change aerodynamic properties and level of secondary carrier field. At the same time their directed properties depend significantly on shape, electric dimensions and electro-physical parameters of surfaces intended for placement. Diffraction of electromagnetic waves on bearing surfaces results in shielding of antenna systems. Effects of change of parameters of spatial-frequency selectivity of transmission-reception of signals, reduction of energy potentials of radio channels, formation of spatial-correlated interference, frequencytime parameters of which are identical to parameters of processed radiation, occur. Linear antenna arrays have significant directional action coefficients and capabilities to control directional patterns due to amplitude-phase correction of current of elements without using complex switching devices. Representation of antenna elements of small electric length by dipoles is possible due to constant values of amplitudes and phases of currents at each point of surface. Side surface of cylinder of resonance electric dimensions can be approximated by fuselage of small-size unmanned aerial vehicle of aircraft type. By selecting values of complex dielectric constant of material from which cylinder is made, reflecting properties of aerial object with reduced radar visibility are reproduced. ^arts of directional and bi-static scattering of antenna arrays are investigated based on asymptotic estimates of total electric field of vibrator system and cylinder in far zone. The polarizing components of the magnetic and electric fields on the side surface of the cylinder were represented by equivalent currents approximated by rows of cylindrical functions; Lattice fields in the far zone of the cylinder were by summing up rows of trigonometric functions of azimuth harmonics of its equivalent currents with weight coefficients. Rows of azimuth harmonics of cylinder side surface currents are characterized by fast convergence when its radius belongs to resonance area. The antenna array performance values were using C++ computer program for a computer with an Intel Core i7-8700 processor with 16 GB RAM. Patterns of change of directed properties of arrays with different number of antenna elements are revealed. Due to the formation of the array field not only by the currents of the antenna elements, but also by the surface currents of the cylinder, its beam patterns and bistatic scattering differ significantly from the characteristics in the free space. A significant difference is evident in the change in the shape of the main beams and the appearance of the side lobes of the diagrams due to the secondary radiation of the bearing surface. The shapes of the linear lattice diagrams in the meridian plane of the cylinder, like those of a single elementary electric vibrator, have petal structures. As the number of antenna elements increases, the width of the array pattern decreases the faster the greater the ratio of inter-element distance to wavelength. Increasing the inter-element distance within the wavelength does not significantly change the directional factor. The narrowing of the bi-static scattering pattern as the wavelength decreases is due to the increasing electromagnetic interaction between the vibrators by increasing the flow density of the secondary field. For an antenna array made of small electric length vibrators, significant directivity indicators can be achieved at a low level of secondary field radiation, which allows to ensure low radar visibility of the unmanned aerial vehicle.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
A Study on the Improvement of Air Vehicle Test Equipment(AVTE) stop by UAV Engine noise,"In this era, intelligence is considered a major factor in the defense sector. As a result, securing technology for weapons systems for monitoring and reconnaissance of companies has become inevitable. As a result, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been developed and are actively operating around the world if the flight operation of manned aircraft is restricted, such as in environments that are too dangerous, messy or boring for the military to perform directly. The system of unmanned aerial vehicles, which has been researched and developed in Korea, includes Air Vehicle Test Equipment(AVTE). AVTE is equipment that is connected to an UAV to check its status and allows the operator to check its flightability by issuing an operational command to the UAV and verifying that it follows the command values. This study conducts fault finding on the phenomenon where the AVTE has stopped operating due to engine noise during these operations and analyzes the cause in terms of software, hardware and external environment. Present improvement measures according to the cause are analyzed and the results of verifying that the proposed measures can prevent failure are addressed.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Optimal Use of ISR Assets for Detecting Time-Sensitive Targets Incorporating Satellites in Missile Defense Operations,"North Korea's recent testing of nuclear weapons raises the threat of military activity in the region. As a precaution against such threats, many countries are rushing to build missile defense and missile defense systems by forming networks of platforms, sensors, and military assets. Whereas one of the most important functions of the system is to detect the signs of an enemy attack quickly and accurately, the limitations of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets make it difficult to detect all threats in advance. Consequently, the efficient use of ISR assets is becoming important as the threat increases. In this study, the optimal use of ISR assets is investigated to detect time-sensitive targets, transporter erector launchers (TELs), by the complementary assignment of manned and unmanned aircrafts and satellites. A mathematical optimization model using discrete time and location is proposed to maximize the detection rate of timesensitive targets by optimally assigning ISR assets. The proposed model is tested with nominal data and performance is evaluated for real use. In addition, a sensitivity test on the number of ISR assets is conducted to provide quantitative guidelines for aircraft asset investment by examining the relationship between ISR assets and total detection rate.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Liberty and Lethality: Integrating MC-12W Liberty and Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance Aircraft operations,"Responding to comments made by the Secretary of Defense in April 2008, the United States Air Force began procuring thirty-seven C-12 class aircraft to augment existing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems already operating in the United States Central Command's area of responsibility. However, this effort did not mark the beginning of studies directed at employing off-the-self, mission specialized aircraft for conducting counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. In addition to the MC-12W Liberty aircraft, the USAF was also studying a project designed to provide low cost air support to forces engaged in counterinsurgency operations. The Air Force called this project the Observation/Attack-X or Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance aircraft. Due to similar performance, electro-optical, infrared, imagery collection, and communication reach-back capabilities, these aircraft are both technically capable of performing Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Forward Air Controller-Airborne missions, but there are no current plans for the aircraft to share these mission areas. This study utilizes government requests for information, contracting data, capabilities and need statements, service memoranda, contractor produced publications, flight manuals, training programs, and doctrinal publications to answer the question; can the MC-12W Liberty and Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance aircraft perform common roles and missions while integrating operations, in order to maximize their support to COIN operations. This study begins by detailing the operational requirements and historical events that led to the acquisition of the MC-12W Liberty aircraft. It also introduces the requirements for a Light Attack/Armed Reconnaissance aircraft.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Meta-Analysis Of Corrosion Studies for Maritime Patrol and Reconnaissance Aircraft (MPRA),"It is very important to find means and methods to reduce maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft(MPRA) corrosion costs. This thesis examines recent Department of Defense (DOD) and Government Accounting Office (GAO) corrosion studies to conduct meta-analysis and make recommendations based on correlated findings. The methods adopted for this thesis consist of a literature review, heuristic flow diagram, case study selections and meta-analysis. The conclusions are that the cost of MPRA corrosion treatment and prevention is detrimental in the consumption of manpower and resources, is a high readiness degrader, and diverts funding that could be used for future programs. Corrosion treatment and prevention processes of the past may not be environmentally acceptable today. This study recommends that HAZMAT material used to combat aircraft paint/corrosion be carefully monitored and reduced to a minimum as soon as possible. Further, man-hour reduction studies are needed to optimize a balance between corrosion prevention and treatment cost and man-hours. One recommendation is to establish an international naval corrosion working group to pool talent and resources with our naval allies toward developing common corrosion tactics. An additional recommendation is to fund a comprehensive MPRA wash interval optimization study to include all MPRA-type model series aircraft.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
NASA/USRA High Altitude Reconnaissance Aircraft,"At the equator, the ozone layer ranges from approximately 80,000 to 130,000+ feet which is beyond the capabilities of the ER-2, NASA's current high altitude reconnaissance aircraft. This project is geared to designing an aircraft that can study the ozone layer at the equator. This aircraft must be able to cruise at 130,000 lbs. of payload. In addition, the aircraft must have a minimum of a 6,000 mile range. The low Mach number, payload, and long cruising time are all constraints imposed by the air sampling equipment. A pilot must be able to take control in the event of unforseen difficulties. Three aircraft configurations were determined to be the most suitable for meeting the above requirements, a joined-wing, a bi-plane, and a twin-boom conventional airplane. The techniques used have been deemed reasonable within the limits of 1990 technology. The performance of each configuration is analyzed to investigate the feasibility of the project requirements. In the event that a requirement can not be obtained within the given constraints, recommendations for proposal modifications are given.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2020
Accurate Analysis of Target Data and Transmission of Measuring Information Security by Airborne Photoelectric Platform,"Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft can acquire data by remote sensing. The photoelectric imaging platform of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is mounted on the UAV, which uses photogrammetry, image processing and other technologies to accurately analyze the target of interest. With the continuous development of technology, people's requirement for target positioning accuracy is increasing. At the same time, the airborne optoelectronic platform meets the characteristics of wireless sensor networks and needs to deploy key management scheme to ensure the security of data transmission. In this study, coordinate transformation method is used to generate a photoelectric imaging target positioning scheme, based on which the factors affecting the accuracy of target data are analyzed. Using the idea of Monte Carlo algorithm and MatLab simulation, the attitude angle of aircraft and the angle error of gyroscope affect the accuracy of target data. In order to improve the security of data transmission, the identity authentication scheme of Elliptic Curve (ECC) is taken as the research object of key management scheme in this study. Considering the limited resources of wireless sensor networks, a combined public key+identity encryption scheme is proposed. In the simulation process, the scheme shows good performance in encryption/decryption overhead, and the length of ciphertext/private key is controllable. This research is helpful for the airborne photoelectric platform to measure the target data better and ensure the security of data transmission.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2019
Moblie Robot Path Planning using Deep Learning-based Multi target Detection,"Unmmanned systems are one of the essential areas of future military weapons systems that must carry out dangerous and cmplex missions. Especially, deep learning should recognize many landmarks through the image and project them onto the map to improve the problem of position estimation, because it shows excellent performance of recognizing and classifying the characteristics of image data among other artificial intelligence techniques.

Optimum Design of Integrated Mast Minimizing Both RCS and EMI,"In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the performance of the integrated mast in terms of radar cross section (RCS) and electromagnetic interference (EMI). Considering a situation detected by the enemy's reconnaissance aircraft, the angle at which the RCS should be reduced was selected and used to define the counter-detection score. EMI shielding score were defined from S21 among sensors placed in the integrated mast. The combined performance score was defined by combining the two scores. The performance evaluation scores proposed in this paper were used to evaluate three types of integrated mast shapes with different corner shapes. Comparison result for evaluated scores shows that the curved edge mast has the best performance in both RCS and EMI. The geometric optics was used for the calculation of RCS, and multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM) was used for EMI calculation.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2019
Localization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Operators Based on Reconnaissance Plane With Multiple Array Sensors,"For the sake of positioning the illegal unmanned aerial vehicle operators, the paper proposes a direction of arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm based on the reconnaissance plane with multiple array sensors. First, the number of unmanned aerial vehicle signals is determined by information theory criteria. Then combined support vector regression, the direction of the operator is calculated according to some approximating function through training. Finally, the location can be estimated by integrating the DOAs acquired with the array sensors on the reconnaissance aircraft. This algorithm is convenient and fast to be realized, moreover, as a result of adopting super resolution and multiple kernel learning, it can locate numerous radio signals simultaneously and performs well in the circumstance that signals impinge on the sensor array with small-angle interval, as well as the conditions of small samples and low signal to noise ratio, besides, the algorithm also applies to the array which gain-phase inconsistency exists among the sensors.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2019

The method of vision systems application for contactless measurements of objects on the example of decision of aerial reconnaissance,"The continuous development of computer technology opens more opportunities for its application in creating smart and effective computer vision systems (VS), aimed at solving problems related to digital image processing and object recognition. VS is especially needed in the areas of science and technology requiring the use of contactless methods for measuring various parameters of the objects. The main task for the improvement of VS is the improvement of existing and development of new methods for facilitating the expansion of functionality of these systems. The urgency and relevance of VS are considered on the example, which presents a model of conducting aerial reconnaissance. Tactical unmanned reconnaissance aircraft makes for the departure shot of a certain area. The shooting is done at height and with the resolution necessary for confident recognition of targets like ?tank? or ?car?. The area of goals that you want to detect and recognize then on the received intelligence, is very small compared to the whole area of the earth's surface, entering the frame. It was found that on analysis of the entire survey, by visual inspection of time you will need many times more than it spent on its implementation. Thus, the main problem lies in the fact that the volume of intelligence information obtained through imagery intelligence is huge and it requires considerable time for processing. Expediting the processing of intelligence information is only possible by parallelization of the processing and/or automation using the technical means like VS. Accordingly, it is necessary to the development of contactless measurement methods based on the methods and means aimed at the solution of similar tasks that require processing of large amount of optical data over a short period or in real time.",Reconnaissance aircraft,2017
A Study on Attitude Estimation of UAV Using Image Processing,"Recently, researchers are actively addressed to utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAV) for military and industry applications. One of these applications is to trace the preceding flight when it is necessary to track the route of the suspicious reconnaissance aircraft in secret, and it is necessary to estimate the attitude of the target flight such as Roll, Yaw, and Pitch angles in each instant. In this paper, we propose a method for estimating in real time the attitude of a target aircraft using the video information that is provide by an external camera of a following aircraft. Various image processing methods such as color space division, template matching, and statistical methods such as linear regression were applied to detect and estimate key points and Euler angles.
