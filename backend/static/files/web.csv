JF-17 Thunder,Multi-role fighter,"The Joint Fighter-17 (JF-17) Thunder multi-role fighter was started life as a joint US and Chinese program. In the late 1980s Chengdu and Grumman made a deign study to upgrade Chinese Xian F-7M fighters to Super 7 standard. This new aircraft was planned to be offered for export by China as a low-cost replacement for the American Northrop F-5, Chinese F-6 and F-7, as well as SovietMiG-21. This new aircraft was planned to be fitted with Western radar, engine and avionics. However this programme was cancelled in 1990. China continued the Super 7 project on its own and renamed the design as the Fighter China-1 (FC-1) or FC-1 Xiaolong (Fiece Dragon). This design further evolved into a JF-17, that was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. Development started in 1999. Most of the development was carried out in China by Chengdu, however development costs were split equally. It was reported that Russian Mikoyan design bureau provided some assistance in development of this aircraft. The JF-17 made its maiden flight in 2003. First 8 Chinese-built fighters were delivered to Pakistan in 2007-2008. In 2009 an order was signed for a further 42 fighters. These were license-produced locally by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex. By 2015 Pakistan Air Force operated 60 of these aircraft. By 2020 a total of 135 of these multi-role fighters were in Pakistani service and another 64 were on order. Production of this aircraft continues. It is estimated that total requirement of the Pakistani Air Force could be for 250 new fighters. Currently Pakistan Air Force also operate a number of ageing A-5C, F-7P, Mirage 3 and Mirage 5 that a due to be replaced. The JF-17 multi-role aircraft is also proposed for developing countries as a low-cost replacement for their ageing types. It has been exported to Myanmar (16) and Nigeria (3).",,,,
Chengdu J-20,Stealthy air superiority fighter,"First photos of the Chinese J-20 stealthy fighter aircraft appeared in 2010. It was designed to compete against fifth-generation fighters, such as a USF-22 Raptor and advanced fourth-generation fighters, such as a RussianSu-57 (previously known as PAK-FA). It is speculated, that development of the J-20 was assisted by the Russian MiG aviation company. After collapse of the Soviet Union this aviation giant suffered from loss of orders and uncertain future. Externally the J-20 strongly resembles a cancelled RussianMiG 1.42 multi-role fighter. The MiG 1.42 demonstrator  was first publicly revealed in 1999. It made its first flight in 2001, however the Russian program was suspended due to funding problems. It is rather unusual that photos of this stealthy fighter aircraft came out even before the first flight, considering that all Chinese military programs are kept in high secrecy. However during the last decade China has taken a more transparent approach to its military programs. Still though there is little official information on this plane. When the first photos appeared some sources suggested, that this aircraft is a high-flying long-range interceptor. Other sources suggested, that it might be a long-range interdictor or tactical bomber. The J-20 is actually a medium- and long-range air superiority fighter, like the US F-22, which might also have a secondary ground attack capability. Actually the new J-20 is an advanced fourth-generation fighter, rather than a true fifth-generation fighter. Still though it easily outclasses older fourth-generation fighters, such as the USF-16 or the RussianSu-27. This aircraft made its first flight in 2011. By 2015 at least 5 prototypes were built. Low-rate initial production commenced in 2015. This new Chinese aircraft was first publicly revealed only in 2016. First operational J-20 stealthy fighters were delivered to Chinese air force in 2016. The J-20 fighter was officially adopted by the Chinese air force in 2017. Some sources report, that China plans to produce 570 of these aircraft.",,,,
Chengdu J-10,Multi-role fighter,"The J-10 multi-role fighter is the first Chinese-developed combat aircraft that approaches Western fighters in terms of performance and capabilities. It is known as Meng Long or Vigorous Dragon in China and as Firebird in the West. Development of the J-10 began in 1988. It was intended to counter threat posed by the Soviet fourth-generation fighters - the MiG-29 and Su-27. The J-10 was initially planned as an air-superiority fighter, however collapse of the Soviet Union and changing requirements shifted the development towards a multi-role fighter. Aircraft made its maiden flight in 1998. The whole project was kept under high secrecy. It is worth mentioning, that the first photos of the J-10 came out only 3-4 years after the first flight. Some sources claim that it was influenced by theIAI Lavi. The J-10 multi-role fighter entered service with Chinese air force in 2004, however it was first publicly revealed only in 2006. Currently around 240 of these aircraft are in service. It is estimated that 300 fighter of this type are required for Chinese air force and possibly naval aviation too. A number of countries, including Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan and Thailand expressed interest in purchasing this aircraft.",,,,
SAC J-31,Stealthy multi-role fighter,The new Chinese J-31 stealthy aircraft was developed by Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). It is also referred as FC-31. Development of this aircraft started in around 2008. Some sources report that in 2007 China received blueprints and other classified information of theF-35 Joint Strike Fighter. This data was used to build the J-31. It is estimated that this stolen classified information saved China 25 years of research and development. The J-31 made its maiden flight in 2012. Significantly improved prototype was observed in 2017.,,,,
Shenyang J-16,Multi-role fighter,"The J-16 is a Chinese twin-engine, tandem-seat, all-weather, multi-role strike fighter. It evolved from theJ-11 air superiority fighter. It is a more advanced version with an added ground attack capability. It is broadly similar in terms of capabilities to theAmerican F-15E. Production of the J-16 began in 2012. This aircraft has been in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) since 2013. The J-16 is still being manufactured and of 2019 more than 128 J-16¡¯s were in PLAAF service.",,,,
Shenyang J-15,Carrierborne air superiority fighter,"The Shenyang J-15, nicknamed the Flying Shark is a carrierborne air superiority fighter jet. Its development was marked by a controversy. Russia claims that China violated intellectual property agreements by creating its own version of Russian Sukhoi Su-33 fighter jet. In 2006 this incident ended negotiations to obtain new military aircraft from Russia.",,,,
Shenyang J-11,Air superiority fighter,"Chinese air force has been looking for a way to produce a counterpart to the fourth generation fighter jets, used by NATO countries. The first idea about developing a Soviet-like fighter emerged in late 70¡¯s when Shenyang factory combined a light fighter design of the Soviet MiG-19 with a British Rolls-Royce Spey 512 engine. This project was known as the J-11, but eventually failed. However this idea was resurrected two decades later.",,,,
SAC J-8 Finback,Air superiority fighter,"Built only in small numbers up to 1987, the J-8 resembled little more than a scaled-up twin-enginedMiG-21 and had only a limited combat capability. Revealed in 1984, the J-8 l (Western reporting name Finback-A) was an all-weather development with a basic fire-control radar, 23 mm cannon and missile armament.",,,,
Dassault Rafale,Multi-role fighter,"The Dassault Rafale will form the cornerstone of French air power until well into the 21st century. The programme began with the Rafale A technology demonstrator that was first flown on 4 July 1986. This established the basic aerodynamic design and evaluated the delta canard configuration, performance, FBW control system and composite-based structure. The generic Rafale D (Discret, or stealthy) - prototype for the Armee de l'Air versions - is slightly smaller and lighter.",,,,
Dassault Mirage 2000 B/C,Multi-role fighter,"For the third generation of its Mirage warplane series, Dassault returned to the delta configuration -? using negative longitudinal stability and an fly-by-wire flight control system - to eliminate many of the shortcomings of a conventionally controlled delta. This combination confers the resulting Mirage 2000 with exceptional maneuverability. A high-priority development programme was launched to ensure a service debut in 1982. The first of five prototypes made its maiden flight in March 1978. Delivery of 124 production 2000C single-seat interceptors began to the Armee de l'air in 1983.",,,,
Dassault Mirage F1,Multi-role fighter,"Dassault's successor to the Mirage III dispensed with the traditional delta layout and adopted a more conventional configuration. The resulting Mirage F1 has 40 per cent more internal fuel in a smaller airframe, a much shorter field length, three times the supersonic endurance, twice the tactical radius at low levels and all-round better maneuverability.",,,,

HAL Tejas,Lightweight multi-role fighter,"The Indian Tejas (Radiance) is a lightweight multi-role fighter, developed by Aeronautical Development Agency and manufactured by HAL. The Tejas made its maiden flight in 2001 and limited production of this aircraft commenced in 2007. Development was finally completed in 2013. The Tejas is expected to enter service with the Indian Air Force and gradually replace the ageing fleet of MiG-21s, MiG-23s, MiG-27s, Jaguars and Mirage 2000s. However currently its production status is uncertain. The first Indian Air Force unit was equipped with two Tejas fighters in 2016. However it is unknown when this aircraft will achieve full operational capability.",,,,
IAI Lavi,Multi-role fighter,The Lavi (young lion) multi-role fighter was developed by the Israel Aircraft Industry (IAI) in the 1980s. First prototype made its maiden flight in 1986. Original requirement was for 300 aircraft of this type to replace the A-4 Skyhawks. The Lavi fighter project was cancelled in 1987 due to funding problems. Only five airframes were ever built. One of the project cancellation reasons was that this fighter did not represent a sufficient advantage over theF-16 and other comparable aircraft. Nevertheless it was an important milestone in the development of the IAF. Later Israel acquired a large number of American planes.,,,,
IAI Kfir,Multi-role fighter,"France's embargo of Mirage 5J fighters in 1967 forced Israel to establish an indigenous aircraft industry. This led directly to an unlicenced copy of the Mirage III as the Nesher. The Nesher was developed by Israel Aircraft Industries into the canard-equipped Kfir (lion cub). Integration of the new US-supplied J79 engine required total redesign of the rear fuselage and a cooling inlet in the dorsal fin. The new forward fuselage was extended to house avionics, including the Elta 2001B ranging radar and a comprehensive weapons delivery and navigation suite. The prototype was flown in 1973 and production Kfir C.2s entered service in the fighter-bomber role with the IDF/AF in 1975.",,,,
Mitsubishi F-3,Prototype stealthy multi-role fighter,"The Mitsubishi F-3 is a planned Japanese indigenous fifth generation fighter. It is planed to evolve from Advanced Technology Demonstrator - X (ATD-X) program. This aircraft is widely known in Japan as Shinshin. Japan wants to field a stealthy fighter in light of China's rapid military modernization. A first mock-up of the ATD-X was constructed in 2005. It was used to study radar cross section in France. Some sources claim that originally the ATD-X was a paper project, intended to pressure the US. Japan wanted to buy AmericanF-22 Raptor stealthy air superiority fighter, however Pentagon refused to allow it. Then funding was provided for development of indigenous aircraft. Currently this aircraft is still under development. First flight commenced in 2016. This first aircraft is used as technology demonstrator and research prototype. Development should be completed in 2017. The Mitsubishi F-3 could reach production after a couple of years. Once operational it will replace a fleet of older Japanese F-15J andMitsubishi F-2 fighters.",,,,

By 2016 a total of 3 prototypes and 2 pre-production aircraft were completed. Factory trials of this aircraft were completed in 2017. In 2019 two of these multi-role fighters were delivered to the Russian Air Force for trials and evaluation and another four were planned to be delivered by the end of 2019. The MiG-35 is also being proposed for export customers, including Algeria, Egypt and India.",,,,
Mikoyan MiG 1.42 (1.44) MFI,Demonstrator for multi-role tactical fighter,"During the mid to late 1990s the aviation community was tantalised by the impending debut of Russia's first fifth-generation fighter, the Mikoyan MFI. The MFI was developed to counter the threat posed by the ATF programme under which theF-22 was created. Mikoyan claims that the MFI's combination of aerodynamic properties, armament and avionics render it superior to any contemporary fighter, including the F-22A.",,,,
Mikoyan MiG-31BM,Multi-role fighter,The MiG-31BM is the latest version of the MiG-31. It evolved as an improved version of the MiG-31B interceptor with an added air-to-ground capability. Development of this aircraft commenced in 1997. First prototype was introduced in 1998. The second prototype was completed until 2006. In 2011 Russian MoD signed the first contract to upgrade a total of 60 aircraft to the new standard. Deliveries the the Russian Air Force commenced in 2011. A follow-on contract for upgrade of more than 50 aircraft was signed in 2014. By 2017 a total of 110 aircraft were reportedly upgraded to the MiG-31BM and MiG-31BMS standards. This upgrade allowed to extend service life of older aircraft for at least another 15 years. It is planned that all operational MiG-31s will be upgraded.,,,,
Mikoyan MiG-31,Long-range interceptor,The MiG-31 (Western reporting name Foxhound-A) was developed as part of an overall programme to provide the Soviet air defenses with the ability to meet the threat posed by NATO low-level strike aircraft and cruise missiles. It was also intended to fulfill high-altitude and high-speed interception,,,,
Mikoyan MiG-29,Multi-role fighter,"The MiG-29 was developed to meet a Soviet Air Force requirement for a lightweight multi-role fighter. It was a Soviet response to the American F-16 multi-role fighter. With its stunning maneuverability, the MiG-29 re-established the Soviet Union's reputation as a producer of capable combat aircraft. This fighter is known in the West as the Fulcrum. The MiG-29 was built in substantial numbers. About 1 600 fighters of this type were built. Most of them (about 900) were exported. After Russia, Ukraine is the next major operator with six regiments (including Fulcrum-Cs). Other operators are Belarus, Bulgaria, Cuba, Eritrea, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Malaysia, Peru, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Yugoslavia. The MiG-29s serve primarily as air defense fighters. All operators have small numbers of MiG-29UB two-seat conversion trainers.",,,,
Mikoyan MiG-25,Interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft,"The Mach 3-capable Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 (Western reporting name Foxbat) was developed in the early 1960s to fulfill the high-altitude and high-speed interception and dedicated reconnaissance roles. First prototype made its maiden flight in 1964. This aircraft was revealed by the Soviets in 1967. Its appearance led to serious concerns throughout the US Department of Defense that the US was being outclassed and led to development of a new F-15 air-superiority fighter in order to counter the threat posed by this Soviet warplane. Production of the MiG-25P (interceptor variant) commenced in 1971 and it entered service with the Soviet Air Force in 1972. Its reporting name in the West was Foxbat-A. Though this aircraft was simultaneously produced in numerous variants. A total of 1 186 MiG-25s of all variants were built until production ceased in 1985. This aircraft was exported to some countries. Since its introduction the MiG-25 was an important type in service with the Soviet air force and air defense forces. After the collapse of the Soviet Union a number of MiG-25s were passed on to successor states. In the 1990s the MiG-25 remained an important type in Russia and formed the backbone of the Russia's air defenses. Though the numbers were gradually reducing. These aircraft flew missions during the 1999 military campaign in Chechnya. In 2001 Russian Air Force still operated limited numbers of MiG-25PD/PDS (Foxbat-E) interceptors. In 2010 a total of 42 MiG-25RBs (reconnaissance-bomber variant) remained in service. These were found with units that predominantly used the newerMiG-31. The MiG-25 has been retired from the Russian service, however small numbers may remain operational with some of the export operators, including Algeria and Syria.",,,,
Mikoyan MiG-23,Tactical fighter,"The 'swing-wing' MiG-23 (NATO reporting name Flogger) was developed in the 1960s in response to the USF-14 Tomcat. It succeeded the previous MiG-21. It combined greater payload, range and firepower with beyond visual range intercept capability from more powerful onboard sensors. The Model 23-11 prototype first flew in 1967. Production commenced in 1969.",,,,
MiG-21,Fighter aircraft,"The most widely produced supersonic jet fighter of all time, the MiG-21 (Western reporting name Fishbed) is an incredibly prolific aircraft. Dated but nimble, it has allowed skilled pilots in past decades to defeat more advanced aircraft. However, its days are numbered as the majority of air forces switch to newer fighters.",,,,
Sukhoi Su-57,Stealthy multi-role fighter,"The Sukhoi Su-57 is a new Russian fighter aircraft. It started life of the PAK FA (or Future Frontline Aircraft System). Originally it was thought that the PAK FA is an air superiority fighter, however it turned out that this aircraft has a secondary ground attack capability. This new stealthy aircraft was designed to replace ageingMiG-29 and Su-27 fighters. It can be seen as a Russian answer to the USF-22 Raptor. Development of this aircraft commenced in 2001. A T-50 prototype was revealed and made its maiden flight in 2010. In 2014 a pre-production prototype was delivered to the Russian Air Force for trials and evaluation. These trials were completed in 2015. It was planned that this fighter aircraft will enter service in 2017-2018 and should reach full operational capability by 2020. However by 2017 the aircraft was not ready for full-scale production. Most likely that setbacks were related to technical issues, incomplete development of some of its core systems, such as engines, new missiles and electronics, as well as funding problems. In 2017 the PAK FA received a regular Su-57 designation. Russian Air Force has a requirement for up to 150-200 of these new multi-role fighters. Meanwhile the Russian Air Force ordersSu-35 multi-role fighters as an interim measure, until the Su-57 stealthy fighter becomes available. By 2018 at least 9 Su-57 aircraft were built including prototypes and pre-production fighters. It was planned that in 2018 a first batch of 12 pre-production fighters will be delivered to the Russian Air Force. In fact in 2018 a couple of pre-production Su-57 fighters were deployed in Syria. In 2019 Russian Air Force ordered a first batch of 76 Su-57 fighters. Full scale production began during the same year. Deliveries are planned to be completed by 2028. It is claimed that the Su-57 will be also proposed for export customers.",,,,
Sukhoi S-37 Berkut,Research and technology demonstrator aircraft,"On 25 September 1997 the S-37 Berkut (Royal eagle) made its maiden flight from the flight test centre airfield at Zhukhovskiy. The S-37 prototype (sometimes referred as the Su-47) was developed by Sukhoi to explore the post-stall maneuverability and supermaneuverability. Although very much a research aircraft and concept demonstrator, it formed the basis of a new RussianSukhoi Su-57 stealthy multi-role fighter (previously known as PAK FA).",,,,
Sukhoi Su-37 Flanker-E,Multi-role fighter,The Sukhoi Su-37 (NATO designation Flanker-E) multi-role fighter is a further development of the Su-35. This aircraft is sometimes nicknamed the Terminator. Developers had a goal to increase performance and maneuverability of the Su-35 aircraft and update its systems. The Su-37 made its maiden flight in 1996. Only two pre-production technology demonstrators were built due to limited funding and lack of orders. The Su-37 was demonstrated at numerous air shows around the world. It was actively proposed for the Russian Air Force as well as export customers. However this aircraft received no production orders.,,,,
Su-35,Multi-role fighter,"The Su-35 is a significantly developed version of theSu-27. Development began in the early 1980s. The aircraft first flew in 1988 and was originally known as Su-27M. It was proposed as a super agile Su-27 primarily for air superiority missions, but also with a greatly expanded air-to-ground capability. It had a number of improvements in engines, aerodynamics, avionics and construction methods. Later this aircraft was redesignated as the Su-35. It is referred in the West as Flanker-E. Sometimes it is also nicknamed as the Super Flanker. The Su-35 is being proposed as a replacement for Su-27 andMiG-29 fighters. Initial production of the Su-27M commenced in 1988. Later it was redesignated as the Su-35. However only 12 of these aircraft were completed for the Russian Air Force, including 9 pre-production aircraft. Production ceased in 1995. Improved versions of the Su-35 emerged, including the Su-35BM and Su-35UB. However only the Su-35S, which made its first flight in 2008, became the definitive version, which was produced in quantity. Some sources report that by 2017 Russian Air Force operated 68 Su-35S aircraft. In 2015 China ordered 24 of these multi-role fighters, becoming the first foreign customer. A first batch of 4 aircraft was delivered to China in 2016. By 2017 a total of 14 aircraft were reportedly delivered. In 2017 Indonesia ordered 11 aircraft however this deal was abandoned.",,,,
Sukhoi Su-33,Carrier-based air superiority fighter,"The Sukhoi Su-33 was designed primarily for use on the RussianAdmiral Kuznetsov heavy aviation cruiser. It evolved from theSu-27.

Its reporting name in the West is Flanker-C. To date more than 200 of these aircraft have been built in Russia. Also India produces a version this aircraft locally under license.",,,,
Sukhoi Su-27,Air superiority fighter,"The Su-27 was developed primarily for Russia's air-defense interceptor forces. Work on the T-10 design that led to the Su-27 began in 1969. The requirement was for a highly maneuverable fighter with very long range, heavy armament and modern sensors, capable of meeting the F-15 on equal terms.? The first? T-10 prototype (Western reporting name Flanker-A) flew in 1977. The early flight development programme revealed serious problems with initial design. Several pilots reportedly died during accidents testing these new aircraft. This led to a total redesign of the aircraft. The resulting T-10S-1 flew in 1981. The single-seat Su-27 (Flanker-B) eventually entered operational service in 1985 and despite its age remains a formidable interceptor. The Su-27 air superiority fighter and its variants have been exported to a number of countries and it is still widely used.",,,,
Yakovlev Yak-141,VTOL multi-role fighter,"The Yak-141 (Western reporting name Freestyle) was a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) multi-role fighter. Its original designation was the Yak-41, however this designation was classified by the Soviet military. The Yak-141 was actually a fictitious name, applied to the demonstrator aircraft which set a number of world records. By this name this shipborne fighter was known in the West, it was also applied for promotional purposes by the Yakovlev Design Bureau.",,,,
Atlas Cheetah,Multi-role fighter,A November 1977 United Nations embargo on the delivery of weapons to South Africa forced the South African Air Force (SAAF) to place a high priority on a mid-life upgrade of the aircraft surviving from the 74 Dassault Mirage IIIs and related types received during 1963-70. The upgrade made extensive use of Israeli technology (a fact that was officially denied) and produced aircraft with similar capabilities and avionics to the Israeli Kfir.,,,,
KF-16,Multi-role fighter,The KF-16 is a South Korean multi-role fighter. It is a license-produced version of the American F-16. It was locally produced by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI).

AIDC F-CK-1 Ching Kuo,Multi-role fighter,"Taiwan's ambitious programme to develop an advanced fighter to replace its fleet of F-5s and F-104s began in 1982, after the US government placed an embargo on the sale of the Northrop F-20, General DynamicsF-16, and any comparable fighter. The same restrictions were not placed on technical assistance, however, and US aerospace companies have collaborated closely with AIDC to develop an indigenous fighter and weapons system. Assistance has been provided by General Dynamics (airframe), Garrett (propulsion), Westinghouse (radar) and a Smiths Industries-led team (avionics).",,,,
Panavia Tornado ADV,Interceptor,"Developed from the Tornado IDS for a wholly RAF requirement, the Tornado ADV (Air Defense Variant) is optimized for long-range interception. Key features comprised installation of Foxhunter radar and a lengthened fuselage for carriage of semi-recessed Sky Flash air-to-air missiles. The interim F.Mk 2 was soon replaced by the definitive F.Mk 3.",,,,
British Aerospace Sea Harrier,Ship-based STOVL fighter and ground attack aircraft,"The versatility and effectiveness of a maritime version of the Harrier were clear as early as 1966, but it was not until May 1975 that the go-ahead was given for development of a dedicated naval variant. Compared to the RAF's Harrier GR.Mk 3, this introduced a new forward fuselage seating the pilot higher to provide space for extra avionics which included a Blue Fox multi-mode radar. The type was intended to be multi-role, and gained the designation FRS for fighter/reconnaissance/strike (for which latter role it carried a lightweight version of the free-fall WE177 weapon).",,,,
Lockheed Martin F-35,Stealthy multi-role fighter,"The Lockheed Martin's F-35 multi-role fighter (also known as the Lightning II) was a contender for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, which was intended to replace existing aircraft types with a common fighter. The JSF concept was introduced by the US Air Force. Aim of this program was to combine conventional fighter aircraft for the Air Force, catapulted ship-borne aircraft for the US Navy and short take-off-and-vertical-landing fighter for the US Marine Corps.",,,,
F-35A,Stealthy multi-role fighter,"The F-35A is a conventional take-off and landing version of the genericF-35 Lightning II multi-role fighter. The generic F-35 aircraft was proposed in three main variants, including the F-35A conventional take-off and landing aircraft, F-35B short-rake of and vertical landing aircraft andF-35C carrier-based aircraft. The F-35A was developed for the US Air Force (USAF). It is the smallest and lightest version of the F-35. It was planned that these 3 variants of the F-35 will share about 80% of their parts to keep development and production costs low. This also would require less logistic support. However it turned out that by 2017 the design commonality was only 20%. Development of this aircraft was principally funded by the United States, while other partner governments provided additional funding.,evelopment program of the F-35 series was plagued by constant cost overruns. The F-35A will be the most numerous version of the F-35. In the USAFs service the F-35A will replace theA-10 andF-16 warplanes. Initial squadron of F-35As was combat ready in 2016. This?conventional take-off and landing version is being exported to a number of countries, including Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Turkey, and possibly, some other countries. However some operators ordered relatively small number of these multi-role fighters due to its impressive price tag.",,,,
F-35B,Stealthy multi-role fighter with STOVL capability,"The F-35B is a Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) aircraft. It is also known as the Lightning II. The F-35B is a modified version of the genericF-35 multi-role fighter. This model was developed for the US Marine Corps, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. Development of this aircraft was principally funded by the United States, with the United Kingdom and other partner governments providing additional funding. The generic F-35 aircraft was proposed in three main variants, including the F-35A conventional take-off and landing aircraft, F-35B short-rake of and vertical landing aircraft andF-35C carrier-based aircraft. It was planned that these variants will share about 80% of their parts to keep development and production costs low. This also would require less logistic support. However it turned out that by 2017 the design commonality was only 20%. Development program of the F-35 series was plagued by constant cost overruns. Low-rate initial production F-35B aircraft had a unit price of around $122 million per aircraft. As example anF-22 Raptor stealthy fighter, which is the most capable fighter aircraft ever built, costs around $150 million per aircraft. The F-35B achieved initial operational capability with the US Marine Corps (USMC) in 2015. It was the first variant of the F-35 that reached operational service. The F-35B replaces in USMC service the older F/A-18 multi-role fighters, notably its -A, -B,-C and -D models and AV-8B close support aircraft. The US Marines also operate another F-35C carrier-based variant. It is planned that the F-35B will be exported to United Kingdom, Italy, Turkey, and possibly some other countries.",,,,

Lockheed Martin / Boeing F-22 Raptor,Stealthy air superiority fighter,"Developed to meet the USAF's Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) requirement for anF-15 replacement.,Requirement for a new fighter was issued in the early 1980s. Two companies competed to meet this USAF requirement, including Lockheed Martin (which teamed up with Boeing and General Dynamics) with a YF-22 prototype and Northrop (which teamed with McDonnel Douglas) with its YF-23. In 1991 the YF-22 design was announced the winner.,It was more agile than the YF-23, but less stealthier and slower. Between 1990 to 1997 two YF-22A prototypes evaluated some of the technologies proposed for the production ATF.",,,,
Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet,Multi-role fighter,"The first of McDonnell Dauglas's (Boeing from 1997) Hornet upgrade concepts to reach fruition is the F/A-18E Super Hornet. The first F/A-18E made its maiden flight in November 1995 and the first aircraft was formally accepted into service with VFA-122 on 15 January 1999. The avionics upgrade is centred on the Raytheon APG-73 radar as already fitted to late versions of the F/A-18C. The IDECM (Integrated Defensive Electronic Counter Measures) system has three major elements: an ALR-67(V)3 RWR, ALQ-214 radio-frequency counter measures system and ALE-55 fibre-optic towed decoy system.",,,,
Boeing F/A-18A/C Hornet,Naval multi-role fighter,"The world's premier naval fighter originated as a more sophisticated naval derivative of the Northrop YF-17 that was pitted against the General Dynamics YF-16 in the US Navy's Air Combat Fighter programme of 1976. The YF-17? was selected by the US Navy and eventually adopted as the F/A-18 Hornet. Even though the YF-16 lightweight fighter lost this compwetition for the naval fighter, it was adopted by the US Air Force as theF-16,.,The first of 11 trials Hornets made its maiden flight on 18 November 1978. Production of the initial F/A-18A single-seat version eventually totalled 371 aircraft, the first US Navy squadron receiving its aircraft in 1983.",,,,
F-16V,Lightweight multi-role fighter,"In 2012 the US Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin a contract to upgrade a total of 145 F-16A and F-16B fighters operated by Taiwan's air force. The upgraded aircraft is known as the F-16V. Its unofficial nickname is the Viper due to the ""V"" letter in the designation. This lightweight multi-role fighter made its first flight in 2015. It is likely that Taiwan will be the first operator of this aircraft. In 2015 it was announced that Lockheed Martin will upgrade a total of 134 South Korea's KF-16 fighters to the F-16V standard. The US Air Force also had intentions to upgrade its fleet of more than 1 000 F-16s as an interim measure, until theF-35 is fielded. As upgrading existing forth-generation fighters is far cheaper than buying new fifth-generation fighters.",,,,
F-16 Fighting Falcon,Multi-role fighter,"Originally conceived as a lightweight air-combat fighter, the Lockheed Martin (originally General Dynamics) F-16 has evolved into a versatile and effective multi-role workhorse. It was intended to supplement contemporaryF-15 Eagle air superiority fighter. The F-16 was a lighter and less capable warplane than the F-15 Eagle, however it was also less expensive to produce and to maintain. The F-16 made its maiden flight in 1974. Over 4 400 of these aircraft were built. The type is currently operated by 25 air forces. The US Air Force (USAF) will operate its F-16 fleet until 2025. It will be gradually replaced with the newF-35.",,,,
F-15 Advanced Eagle,Multi-role fighter,"The Advanced Eagle is not an entirely new fighter, but rather an upgrade of the older F-15 Eagle variants. It is also referred as F-15 2040C. By 2018 there were just over 200 older F-15 fighters in service with the US Air Force. Even though the original F-15 Eagle entered service back in 1976, and now in service for over 40 years, it remains a formidable warplane. This fighter was advanced at the time and was exported only to trusted US allies, including Israel, Japan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Korea. It is an air-superiority fighter, designed to gain and maintain air supremacy. The Advanced Eagle also has a secondary air-to-ground capability. Upgraded Advcanced Eagles could complementF-22 Raptor andF-35 Lightning II fighters. Though unlike these two fighters, the F-15 is not stealthy.",,,,
F-15SE Silent Eagle,Multi-role fighter,"The BoeingF-15E Eagle has been in the service of the US Air Force since 1989. This aircraft has recommended itself well. However it becomes older and may need upgrades in the near future. Boeing began development of the new, upgraded and stealthy version in 2009. This aircraft was developed as a private venture. The official name of the advanced version is F-15SE Silent Eagle. So far there is only one unit, developed by Boeing, which made its maiden flight in 2010. Now this aircraft serves as a demonstrator. The cost of producing a single Silent Eagle is about $100 million. It is much more compared with the cost of building the standard F-15E Eagle. However, the new version seems to be far better.",,,,
McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle,Air superiority fighter,"In 1967 the Soviet Union revealed a newMiG-25 high-speed and high-altitude interceptor, which had tremendous performance.,Its appearance led to serious concerns throughout the Department of Defense that the US was being outclassed. Also there were some other new Soviet developments that posed threat. A new fighter was required, that could meet expected performance of the MiG-25.",,,,
Grumman F-14 Tomcat,Carrier-based multi-role fighter,"During the late 1970s the Grumman F-14 Tomcat was widely regarded as the most important aircraft in the US Navy. Only the Tomcat was felt to be capable of defending the Carrier Battle Group from long-range cruise missile carriers, with its unmatched potential to fire off a salvo of up to six ultra long-range Phoenix air-to-air missiles against high- or low-flying targets, and then to deal with any leakers with AIM-9s or the internal 20-mm cannon. However, the credibility of the Phoenix has been dented by a poor showing in combat and trials, while the F-14 still cannot carry today's leading air-to-air missile the AIM-120 AMRAAM. AIM-54s fired at long range by F-14Ds in two recent, separate engagements at IraqiMiG-25s and MiG-23s missed their targets.",,,,
Northrop F-5E Tiger II,Lightweight tactical fighter,"The first F-5A Freedom Fighter single-seat light-fighter prototype flew in May 1963 and went on to form the basis of a major warplane family. This plane was a cheaper alternative for full-blown fighters, and was exported to less wealthy US allies. Canadair built the CF-5A/Ds and NF-5A/Bs for the Canadian and Dutch air force respectively; the survivors of these fleets are finding a ready resale market to countries including Botswana, Turkey and Venezuela. In addition, South Korea, Brazil, Greece, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela and Yemen all currently operate first generation F-5s. Venezuela's VF-5A/Ds have received a limited upgrade by Singapore Technologies Aerospace.",,,,

Tupolev Tu-22M,Medium-range bomber,"The Tu-22M (Western reporting name Backfire) was developed from the earlier Tu-22 design, incorporating variable-geometry outer wing panels. Even though it is designated as ""improved"" version of the Tu-22, it had so many differences that the Tu-22M can be seen as a completely different and much more capable aircraft.,The first Tu-22M0 prototype flew in 1969. I,t was powered by a military derivative of the engine, originally designed for the Tu-144 supersonic airliner (Soviet copy of the Concorde). The Tu-22M is extremely fast, even at low level. It was mainly intended to engage US carrier battle groups. However this bomber lacks sufficient range for truly strategic missions and is classified as a medium-range bomber.",,,,
Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit,Stealthy strategic bomber,"The black, bat-like B-2A Spirit is the silver bullet of US policy, reserved for use against targets of the highest priority.,The B-2 is the costliest warplane ever built (around $900 million per copy), is difficult to maintain and is prone to trouble with the coating that provides much of its stealth. The B-2 Spirit was developed as a low observable strategic bomber for the Cold War mission of attacking Soviet strategic targets.",,,,

General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark,Tactical bomber,"The F-111 originated in studies for a replacement for Tactical Air Command's F-100 Super Sabres and F-105 Thunderchiefs in the tactical strike role. Tactical Air Command wanted an aircraft which could operate from shorter runways. They also required a longer ferry range as overseas deployments by F-100s were often limited by refuelling problems. The aircraft would also be optimized for very low-level penetration, including a final 370 km dash at Mach 1.2. It would be a multi-role aircraft, capable of Mach 2.5 at high level in the interceptor role. This made it inevitable that the successful design would have a variable geometry, swing wing.",,,,
XAC JH-7,Interdictor and maritime attack aircraft,"The JH-7 has been in development since the mid-1970s to meet a requirement from the Chinese air force and naval aviation for an all-weather interdictor. The JH-7 resembles a scaled-up SEPECAT Jaguar. Its projected performance approaches that of the Tornado IDS, albeit with a reduced payload, but with a longer unrefueled range.

XAC Y-20,Heavy transport aircraft,"The Y-20 is a new Chinese transport aircraft. It is also referred as Kunpeng, a legendary bird from Chinese mythology. This aircraft was developed by Xian Aircraft Corporation (XAC) with Russian and Ukrainian assistance. Nevertheless it is the first heavy airlifter developed in China. Development commenced in the 1990s. In 2000 Antonov Design Bureau of Ukrainiane offered to use the design of theirAn-70 military transport as a basic model. At the time the design of the An-70 was still untested. The proposition was negotiated, but eventually China left the offer unanswered. In 2006 the program became a national priority. Since 2006 development was assisted by the Antonov Design Bureau of Ukraine. The joint project was known in Ukraine as An-70-600. It was essentially a larger and turbofan-powered version of the An-70. The Y-20 made its first flight in 2013. China became the forth country in the world, after United States, Russia and Ukraine, that developed a 200-ton military cargo jet. It is a milestone in China's defense industry. Series production of the Y-20 began in 2015. This aircraft became operational with the Chinese air force in 2016. Some sources report, that as of 2016 a total of 8 aircraft were built.

In the 1960s China purchased a couple of An-12 airlifters, alongside with the license to assemble them locally. However due to Sino-Soviet split, the Soviet Union withdrew its technical assistance. In 1969 Xian Aviation Company began to reverse-engineer this aircraft for local production. The Y-8 made its first flight in 1974. Then production was transferred from Xian to Shaanxi Aircraft Factory. Production commenced in 1981. Even though in the early 1980s the original An-12 was already out-dated and Soviets were looking for a replacement, this aircraft recommended itself well. It is estimated that 169 Y-8 aircraft were produced until 2010. The Y-8 has become one of the most popular Chinese military and civilian transport aircraft. It has been one of the largest transport aircraft in China. The Y-8 has been exported to Burma, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Tanzania, Venezuela, and possibly some other countries.",,,,
TRANSALL C-160,Tactical transport aircraft,"The C-160 military transport aircraft was jointly developed and produced by West German and French companies. An agreement between two countries to development a new aircraft was signed in 1957. Italy was also involved in the early stages of the project, but later left the project in favor for their indigenous aircraft. In 1959 a Transporter Allianz consortium was formed (TRANSALL). It comprised of Nord Aviation of France and Weser Flugzeugbau and Hamburger Flugzeugbaug of West Germany. A new tactical aircraft was required to carry 16 t of cargo over a range of 1 720 km, or a load of 8 t over a range of 4 540 km. It was also required that the aircraft could operate on semi-prepared airstrips. The new aircraft made its first flight in 1963. Production commenced in 1965.

Kawasaki C-2,Medium-range transport aircraft,"The Kawasaki C-2 is the new Japanese medium-range transport aircraft. It was developed and manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries for Japan Air Self-Defense Forces (JASDF). The JASDF had a requirement for a modern medium-range transport aircraft. After researching foreign aircraft like theLockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules,Boeing C-17 Globemaster III andAirbus A400M the Japan Ministry of Defense concluded that none of these aircraft has the capabilities required by JASDF. So Japanese MoD decided to develop indigenous transport aircraft. Development of the XC-2 commenced in 2001. It made its first flight in 2010 and was delivered to JASDF for trials and evaluation in 2011. First production aircraft was planned to be delivered to JASDF in 2014. However it was delayed to to some unresolved design problems. The Kawasaki C-2 aircraft became operation with the JASDF in 2016. A total of 30-40 aircraft are planned to be delivered. These will eventually replace a fleet of olderKawasaki C-1 andLockheed Martin C-130 Hercules tactical cargo aircraft. The C-2 can carry much more cargo and has longer range than the previous C-1 and C-130 Hercules.",,,,
Kawasaki C-1,Tactical transport aircraft,"The Kawasaki C-1 is a short-range military transport aircraft, used by Japan Air Self-Defense Forces (JASDF). Development began in 1966. This aircraft was developed to meet the JASDF requirement to replace the previous fleet of World War II era transports, such as Curtis C-46 Commando. TheLockheed C-130 Hercules was initially considered, but it was instead decided to develop an indigenous transport aircraft. As the Japanese Islands did not present a very large geographical area, the JASDF opted for a short-haul aircraft with a relatively light payload. The NAMC (Nihon Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation) consortium was assigned to develop this aircraft. Kawasaki Heavy Industries was the prime contractor and carried out most of the work. The XC-1 prototype made its first flight in 1970. Production commenced in 1971. The first operational aircraft was formally introduced into JASDF service in 1974. The final production C-1 model was delivered in 1981. Only 31 airframes were built, not including prototypes and a few specialized aircraft. The C-1 was assigned to two formations in the JASDF; the 402nd and 403rd Transport Squadrons. As of 2014, the JASDF is slowly beginning to phase-out the C-1 from active service. It is planned that they will be replaced with the newKawasaki C-2 tactical airlifter.",,,,

Z-8,Naval anti-submarine warfare and utility helicopter,"Between 1975 and 1977 a first batch of 12 or 13 French navalized Aerospatiale SA321 Super Frelon helicopters was delivered to China. These helicopters were delivered in two main variants configured for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. It was the first helicopter in China's inventory that was capable of operating from flight decks of warships. China acquired a production license for the Super Frelon helicopter, which was locally produced as the Z-8. Interestingly China also obtained production license for Aerospatiale Dauphin (Z-9). Preparation to produce an indigenous version of the Super Frelon at the Changhe aircraft factory began in 1976. However due to technical difficulties and funding problems the program was efectively stopped in 1979. The program was resumed in 1985 and Chinese prototype made its first flight during the same year. China's license-produced version of the Super Frelon was known as Changhe Z-8. It entered service in 1989. At the time of its introduction it was the largest helicopter produced in China. A number of indigenous variants of the basic Z-8 were built for the Chinese army and navy. This helicopter remains operational with the China's military. Also the Z-8 was produced for civil needs.   The basic Z-8 is a land- or ship based anti-submarine warfare or search and rescue helicopter. The ASW version is fitted with surface search radar, French HS-12 dipping sonar and sonobuoys. Also it carried a Whitehead A244S torpedo under the fuselage. It can be also equipped with YJ-81 and YJ-83K anti-ship missiles, as well as external pods with guns or unguided rockets. These helicopters were also used to ferry supplies and to transport marines.   The cockpit seats pilot and co-pilot.   The Z-8 is a 3-engine helicopter. Two engines are fitted adjacent to each other, while the third one is located behind the main rotor system. This helicopter is powered by Chinese WZ-6 engines, copy of Turbomeca Turmo. Each engine can produce 1 511 shp. It uses a 6-blade main rotor. Additional fuel tank can be installed inside the cabin for extended range.   This helicopter was designed to operate in bad weather conditions. Naval versions have a boat-like fuselages and in case of emergency can land on water. The army versions have standard fuselages.   A large cabin accommodates up to 27 fully-equipped troops or 15 stretchers. Passengers enter and leave the helicopter via sliding side doors or rear ramp. This helicopter can carry around 3 t of cargo. Variants    Z-8A is a transport version for the Chinese army. It was intended to carry troops and supplies. It reportedly made its first flight in 1995. A pair of helicopters was delivered for evaluation to the Chinese army in 2001. A single batch of 6 Z-8A helicopters was delivered in 2002. These helicopters retained the nose radar and side floats. However the Chinese army was not happy with the performance of the Z-8A, as this helicopter required intensive maintenance and is reportedly prone to stall in mid-air. Other variants of the Z-8 (including B, K, S, and J) seem to enjoy a greater success with the Chinese military than the Z-8A. Chinese army also uses a new Z-18 transport helicopter, which is a successor to the Z-8.   Z-8B is another utility and transport version used by the China's army.   Z-8F is an utility version. It is used for search and rescue, utility and transport missions. It is fitted with Canadian Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67B tubroshaft engines.   Z-8K is an upgraded China's navy version, used for search and rescue. It was reportedly developed from the Z-8F. It is equipped with a FLIR turret, searchlight, hoist and flare dispenser. Deliveries began in 2007. Chinese army reportedly acquired dozens of Z-8K series helicopters.   Z-8KA is another China's navy version.   Z-8KH used by the China's army.   Z-8S is an improved naval search and rescue version. It was fitted with upgraded avionics, searchlight and FLIR turret. It made its first flight in 2004.   Z-8J is a naval helicopter.   Z-8JA is another naval variant. In case of emergency this helicopter can land on water. It is currently in service with the Chinese navy.   Z-8JH is another naval search and rescue variant, fitted with medical evacuation equipment. It is currently in service with the Chinese navy.   Z-18 is an improved version of the Z-8. It is based on the Z-8 design, but has a redesigned fuselage and more powerful engines. It has more internal space and can carry more payload. Also it has overall better performance. It was first publicly revealed in 2014 and is currently being produced in quantity. The Z-18 will gradually replace the older Z-8 series helicopters.",,,,

The program was resumed in 1985 and Chinese prototype made its first flight during the same year. China's license-produced version of the Super Frelon was known as Changhe Z-8. It entered service in 1989. At the time of its introduction it was the largest helicopter produced in China. A number of indigenous variants of the basic Z-8 were built for the Chinese army and navy. This helicopter remains operational with the China's military. Also the Z-8 was produced for civil needs.   The basic Z-8 is a land- or ship based anti-submarine warfare or search and rescue helicopter. The ASW version is fitted with surface search radar, French HS-12 dipping sonar and sonobuoys. Also it carried a Whitehead A244S torpedo under the fuselage. It can be also equipped with YJ-81 and YJ-83K anti-ship missiles, as well as external pods with guns or unguided rockets. These helicopters were also used to ferry supplies and to transport marines.   The cockpit seats pilot and co-pilot.   The Z-8 is a 3-engine helicopter. Two engines are fitted adjacent to each other, while the third one is located behind the main rotor system. This helicopter is powered by Chinese WZ-6 engines, copy of Turbomeca Turmo. Each engine can produce 1 511 shp. It uses a 6-blade main rotor. Additional fuel tank can be installed inside the cabin for extended range.   This helicopter was designed to operate in bad weather conditions. Naval versions have a boat-like fuselages and in case of emergency can land on water. The army versions have standard fuselages.   A large cabin accommodates up to 27 fully-equipped troops or 15 stretchers. Passengers enter and leave the helicopter via sliding side doors or rear ramp. This helicopter can carry around 3 t of cargo. Variants    Z-8A is a transport version for the Chinese army. It was intended to carry troops and supplies. It reportedly made its first flight in 1995. A pair of helicopters was delivered for evaluation to the Chinese army in 2001. A single batch of 6 Z-8A helicopters was delivered in 2002. These helicopters retained the nose radar and side floats. However the Chinese army was not happy with the performance of the Z-8A, as this helicopter required intensive maintenance and is reportedly prone to stall in mid-air. Other variants of the Z-8 (including B, K, S, and J) seem to enjoy a greater success with the Chinese military than the Z-8A. Chinese army also uses a new Z-18 transport helicopter, which is a successor to the Z-8.   Z-8B is another utility and transport version used by the China's army.   Z-8F is an utility version. It is used for search and rescue, utility and transport missions. It is fitted with Canadian Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67B tubroshaft engines.   Z-8K is an upgraded China's navy version, used for search and rescue. It was reportedly developed from the Z-8F. It is equipped with a FLIR turret, searchlight, hoist and flare dispenser. Deliveries began in 2007. Chinese army reportedly acquired dozens of Z-8K series helicopters.   Z-8KA is another China's navy version.   Z-8KH used by the China's army.   Z-8S is an improved naval search and rescue version. It was fitted with upgraded avionics, searchlight and FLIR turret. It made its first flight in 2004.   Z-8J is a naval helicopter.   Z-8JA is another naval variant. In case of emergency this helicopter can land on water. It is currently in service with the Chinese navy.   Z-8JH is another naval search and rescue variant, fitted with medical evacuation equipment. It is currently in service with the Chinese navy.   Z-18 is an improved version of the Z-8. It is based on the Z-8 design, but has a redesigned fuselage and more powerful engines. It has more internal space and can carry more payload. Also it has overall better performance. It was first publicly revealed in 2014 and is currently being produced in quantity. The Z-18 will gradually replace the older Z-8 series helicopters.",,,,

SpaceX is working with the FAA to prepare a draft Environmental Assessment (EA) which will be subject to the FAA¡¯s evaluation and approval.The EA will allow the FAA to determine the appropriate course of action: preparation of an EIS because the proposed action¡¯s environmental impacts would be significant; issuance of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI); or issuance of a ¡°Mitigated FONSI¡± providing for mitigation measures to address the proposed action¡¯s environmental impacts. The FAA may make its determination during the EA process or after SpaceX presents a draft EA for FAA approval. To receive the licenses, SpaceX must complete a safety review and develop agreements for the license application in addition to the environmental review. Information about the FAA environmental review process as it relates to commercial space transportation is posted at faa.gov/space/environmental.",,FAA,"November 23, 2020 4:19:27 PM EST",

The data from these flights has informed ongoing rulemaking, policy and guidance, and will continue to support future efforts.¡°At the onset of the public health emergency, many of the IPP participants were able to pivot from their original missions to support the COVID-19 response and recovery, demonstrating the increasing value of drone operations in this new environment,¡± said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson.Eight of the nine participants selected for IPP will participate in BEYOND, including:Choctaw Nation of OklahomaInnovation and Entrepreneurship Investment Authority of VirginiaKansas Department of TransportationMemphis-Shelby County Airport AuthorityNorth Carolina Department of TransportationNorth Dakota Department of TransportationCity of Reno, NevadaUniversity of Alaska-FairbanksVisit our website for additional information on BEYOND.",,FAA,30-Oct-20,
Press Release ¨C U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao Announces Historic Commercial Space Transportation Reforms,,"WASHINGTON ¨C U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao today announced the publication of the Federal Aviation Administration¡¯s (FAA) Streamlined Launch and Reentry Licensing Requirements Final Rule (PDF) for commercial space transportation launches and reentries.¡°This historic, comprehensive update to commercial space launch and reentry licensing requirements facilitates greater growth in this industry and helps America to maintain our #1 position in the world,¡± said U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao.This rule modernizes the way FAA regulates and licenses commercial space operations and allows the burgeoning aerospace industry to continue to innovate and grow, while maintaining public safety. Deputy Assistant to the President and Executive Secretary of the National Space Council Dr. Scott Pace said, ¡°In meeting the President¡¯s mandate in Space Policy Directive-2 to streamline regulations on commercial spaceflight, the Department of Transportation is strengthening the United States¡¯ continued leadership in space commerce. I commend Secretary Chao, the Department, and the Office of Commercial Space Transportation for updating launch regulations and licensing to ensure the United States remains the flag of choice for the growing commercial space sector.¡±The new rule consolidates four regulatory parts and applies a single set of licensing and safety regulations for all types of vehicle operations. It also provides flexibility for operators to meet safety requirements. The rule improves efficiency by encouraging launch and reentry operators to suggest and implement design and operational solutions to meet the regulatory standards.¡°This rule paves the way for an industry that is moving at lightning speed,¡± said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. ¡°We are simplifying the licensing process and enabling industry to move forward in a safe manner.¡± The final rule¡¯s improved application processes (PDF) allow:A single operator¡¯s license that can be used to support multiple launches or reentries from potentially multiple launch site locations.Early review when applicants submit portions of their license application incrementally.Applicants to negotiate mutually agreeable reduced time frames for submittals and application review periods.Applicants to apply for a safety element approval with a license application, instead of needing to submit a separate application.Additional flexibility on how to demonstrate high consequence event protection.Neighboring operations personnel to stay during launch or reentry in certain circumstances.Ground safety oversight to be scoped to better fit the safety risks and reduce duplicative requirements when operating at a federal site.This rule will become effective 90 days after publication in the Federal Register. The FAA will initially seek public comment (for a period of 30 days) on three Advisory Circulars  (ACs) on the following topics:  High Consequence Protection (PDF), High Fidelity Flight Safety Analysis (PDF), and Computing Systems and Software (PDF). The FAA may issue updated versions of these ACs if warranted based on comments received.  Each AC will contain a feedback form with specific instructions on how to provide comments to the FAA on that AC.Twenty-four additional ACs will be published within one year or as needed. Legacy licenses can still be used for up to five years after the rule¡¯s effective date.FAA is responsible for ensuring the protection of the public, property, national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. during commercial launch or reentry activities. The agency also encourages, facilitates, and promotes U.S. commercial space transportation. To date, FAA has licensed or permitted more than 380 launches and reentries.",,FAA,15-Oct-20,

FAA Administrator Completes Boeing 737 MAX Flight,,"Dickson¡¯s flight took two hours and included a number of scenarios to demonstrate the proposed software and design changes to the aircraft¡¯s automated flight control system. Dickson, along with FAA Deputy Administrator Dan Elwell, completed the new recommended pilot training for the aircraft on Tuesday.While Dickson¡¯s flight is an important milestone, a number of key steps remain in the FAA¡¯s evaluation of Boeing¡¯s proposed changes to the aircraft¡¯s flight control system and training.A copy of Dickson¡¯s opening remarks at a news briefing in Seattle following the flight are included below.The FAA will not speculate about how long it will be until the aircraft is returned to passenger service. As we have stated throughout our work on the 737 MAX, the agency is following a deliberate process and will take the time it needs to thoroughly review Boeing¡¯s work. We will lift the grounding order only after FAA safety experts are satisfied that the aircraft meets certification standards.The remaining tasks include: Flight Standardization Board (FSB) Report ¨C A Joint Operations Evaluation Board (JOEB) recently met for nine days to review Boeing¡¯s proposed training for 737 MAX flight crews. The JOEB was comprised of civil aviation authorities from the United States, Canada, Brazil, and the European Union. The results of this evaluation will be incorporated into the draft FAA Flight Standardization Board (FSB) report, which will be posted for public comment in the near future. The FAA will publish a final FSB report after reviewing and addressing public comments on the draft FSB Report.Final Design Documentation and Technical Advisory Board (TAB) Report ¨C The FAA will review Boeing¡¯s final design documentation to evaluate compliance with all FAA regulations. The multi-agency TAB will also review the final Boeing submission and issue a final report prior to a final determination of compliance by the FAA.Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC) & AD ¨C The FAA will issue a CANIC providing notice of pending significant safety actions and will publish a final AD that addresses the known issues for grounding. The AD will advise operators of required corrective actions before aircraft may re-enter commercial service.FAA Rescinds Grounding Order ¨C This marks the official ungrounding of the aircraft, pending completion by operators of the work specified in the AD, along with any required training.Certificates of Airworthiness ¨C The FAA will retain its authority to issue airworthiness certificates and export certificates for all new 737 MAX airplanes manufactured since the grounding. The FAA will perform in-person, individual reviews of these aircraft.Operator Training Programs ¨C The FAA will review and approve training programs for all Part 121 operators.These actions are applicable only to U.S. air carriers and U.S.-registered aircraft. While our processes will inform other civil aviation authorities, they must take their own actions to return the Boeing 737 MAX to service for their air carriers.  The FAA will ensure that our international counterparts have all necessary information to make a timely, safety-focused decision.Text of FAA Administrator Steve Dickson¡¯s opening remarks at a news briefing following his flight aboard the 737 MAX on Wednesday, September 30, in Seattle.Good morning and thank you for joining us today.Shortly after I took the helm at the FAA, I made a promise that I would fly the 737 MAX and that I wouldn¡¯t sign off on its return to service until I was comfortable putting my family on it.I took the same training that the Joint Operations Evaluation Board looked at during its work at London Gatwick Airport in recent days. This was followed by a session in the 737 MAX simulator, during which I had the opportunity to experience a variety of problems that presented the relevant emergencies that might occur.Today, I flew a similar flight profile in the airplane.I want to make it clear that my flight was separate from the official certification process that¡¯s still underway by the FAA.I¡¯m fortunate to be surrounded by some of the top aviation safety experts in the world to advise me on the engineering aspects of this project.But I¡¯m a pilot, and my lens into the world of aviation has been my decades of experience in the front of the airplane. It was important to me to experience the training and the handling of the aircraft firsthand, so I can have the most complete understanding possible as we continue to move forward with the process.As you know, we posted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for an Airworthiness Directive that would address various safety issues that we and our international partners identified during the last several months. The comment period on that NPRM closed on September 21, and we are now reviewing and responding to those comments before posting a final rule.We expect to take the input from the JOEB and include that in a Draft Flight Standardization Board report, which should be posted for comment in the near future.I know you¡¯ve heard me say this before, but the FAA continues to take a thorough and deliberate approach in our review of Boeing¡¯s proposed changes to the 737 MAX. We are in the home stretch, but that doesn¡¯t mean we are going to take shortcuts to get it done by a certain date.The FAA ¡ª I ¡ª will not approve the plane for return to passenger service until I¡¯m satisfied that we¡¯ve adequately addressed all of the known safety issues that played a role in the tragic loss of 346 lives aboard Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.Not a day goes by that I and my colleagues don¡¯t think about the victims and their families, and our solemn responsibility to get this right. And we will get it right.Now, I¡¯d be happy to answer any questions.",SEATTLE ¡ª Administrator Steve Dickson fulfilled his promise today to pilot the Boeing 737 MAX before the Federal Aviation Administration approves the aircraft¡¯s return to service.,FAA,"October 06, 2020 10:26:02 AM EDT",

NASA Ingenuity Mars Helicopter Prepares for First Flight,,"NASA is targeting no earlier than April 8 for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter to make the first attempt at powered, controlled flight of an aircraft on another planet. Before the 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) rotorcraft can attempt its first flight, however, both it and its team must meet a series of daunting milestones.Ingenuity remains attached to the belly of NASA¡¯s Perseverance rover, which touched down on Mars Feb. 18. On March 21, the rover deployed the guitar case-shaped graphite composite debris shield that protected Ingenuity during landing. The rover currently is in transit to the ¡°airfield¡± where Ingenuity will attempt to fly. Once deployed, Ingenuity will have 30 Martian days, or sols, (31 Earth days) to conduct its test flight campaign.¡°When NASA¡¯s Sojourner rover landed on Mars in 1997, it proved that roving the Red Planet was possible and completely redefined our approach to how we explore Mars. Similarly, we want to learn about the potential Ingenuity has for the future of science research,¡± said Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA Headquarters. ¡°Aptly named, Ingenuity is a technology demonstration that aims to be the first powered flight on another world and, if successful, could further expand our horizons and broaden the scope of what is possible with Mars exploration.¡±Flying in a controlled manner on Mars is far more difficult than flying on Earth. The Red Planet has significant gravity (about one-third that of Earth¡¯s) but its atmosphere is just 1% as dense as Earth¡¯s at the surface. During Martian daytime, the planet¡¯s surface receives only about half the amount of solar energy that reaches Earth during its daytime, and nighttime temperatures can drop as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), which can freeze and crack unprotected electrical components.To fit within the available accommodations provided by the Perseverance rover, the Ingenuity helicopter must be small. To fly in the Mars environment, it must be lightweight. To survive the frigid Martian nights, it must have enough energy to power internal heaters. The system ¨C from the performance of its rotors in rarified air to its solar panels, electrical heaters, and other components ¨C has been tested and retested in the vacuum chambers and test labs of NASA¡¯s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.¡°Every step we have taken since this journey began six years ago has been uncharted territory in the history of aircraft,¡± said Bob Balaram, Mars Helicopter chief engineer at JPL. ¡°And while getting deployed to the surface will be a big challenge, surviving that first night on Mars alone, without the rover protecting it and keeping it powered, will be an even bigger one.¡±Deploying the HelicopterBefore Ingenuity takes its first flight on Mars, it must be squarely in the middle of its airfield ¨C a 33-by-33-foot (10-by-10-meter) patch of Martian real estate chosen for its flatness and lack of obstructions. Once the helicopter and rover teams confirm that Perseverance is situated exactly where they want it to be inside the airfield, the elaborate process to deploy the helicopter on the surface of Mars begins.  ¡°As with everything with the helicopter, this type of deployment has never been done before,¡± said Farah Alibay, Mars Helicopter integration lead for the Perseverance rover. ¡°Once we start the deployment there is no turning back. All activities are closely coordinated, irreversible, and dependent on each other. If there is even a hint that something isn¡¯t going as expected, we may decide to hold off for a sol or more until we have a better idea what is going on.¡±The helicopter deployment process will take about six sols (six days, four hours on Earth). On the first sol, the team on Earth will activate a bolt-breaking device, releasing a locking mechanism that helped hold the helicopter firmly against the rover¡¯s belly during launch and Mars landing. The following sol, they will fire a cable-cutting pyrotechnic device, enabling the mechanized arm that holds Ingenuity to begin rotating the helicopter out of its horizontal position. This is also when the rotorcraft will extend two of its four landing legs.During the third sol of the deployment sequence, a small electric motor will finish rotating Ingenuity until it latches, bringing the helicopter completely vertical. During the fourth sol, the final two landing legs will snap into position. On each of those four sols, the Wide Angle Topographic Sensor for Operations and eNgineering (WATSON) imager will take confirmation shots of Ingenuity as it incrementally unfolds into its flight configuration. In its final position, the helicopter will hang suspended at about 5 inches (13 centimeters) over the Martian surface. At that point, only a single bolt and a couple dozen tiny electrical contacts will connect the helicopter to Perseverance. On the fifth sol of deployment, the team will use the final opportunity to utilize Perseverance as a power source and charge Ingenuity¡¯s six battery cells.¡°Once we cut the cord with Perseverance and drop those final five inches to the surface, we want to have our big friend drive away as quickly as possible so we can get the Sun¡¯s rays on our solar panel and begin recharging our batteries,¡± said Balaram.On the sixth and final scheduled sol of this deployment phase, the team will need to confirm three things: that Ingenuity¡¯s four legs are firmly on the surface of Jezero Crater, that the rover did, indeed, drive about 16 feet (about 5 meters) away, and that both helicopter and rover are communicating via their onboard radios. This milestone also initiates the 30-sol clock during which time all preflight checks and flight tests must take place.¡°Ingenuity is an experimental engineering flight test ¨C we want to see if we can fly at Mars,¡± said MiMi Aung, project manager for Ingenuity Mars Helicopter at JPL. ¡°There are no science instruments onboard and no goals to obtain scientific information. We are confident that all the engineering data we want to obtain both on the surface of Mars and aloft can be done within this 30-sol window.¡±As with deployment, the helicopter and rover teams will approach the upcoming flight test methodically. If the team misses or has questions about an important preflight milestone, they may take one or more sols to better understand the issue. If the helicopter survives the first night of the sequence period on the surface of Mars, however, the team will spend the next several sols doing everything possible to ensure a successful flight, including wiggling the rotor blades and verifying the performance of the inertial measurement unit, as well as testing the entire rotor system during a spin-up to 2,537 rpm (while Ingenuity¡¯s landing gear remain firmly on the surface).The First Flight Test on MarsOnce the team is ready to attempt the first flight, Perseverance will receive and relay to Ingenuity the final flight instructions from JPL mission controllers. Several factors will determine the precise time for the flight, including modeling of local wind patterns plus measurements taken by the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) aboard Perseverance. Ingenuity will run its rotors to 2,537 rpm and, if all final self-checks look good, lift off.  After climbing at a rate of about 3 feet per second (1 meter per second), the helicopter will hover at 10 feet (3 meters) above the surface for up to 30 seconds. Then, the Mars Helicopter will descend and touch back down on the Martian surface.Several hours after the first flight has occurred, Perseverance will downlink Ingenuity¡¯s first set of engineering data and, possibly, images and video from the rover¡¯s Navigation Cameras and Mastcam-Z. From the data downlinked that first evening after the flight, the Mars Helicopter team expect to be able to determine if their first attempt to fly at Mars was a success.On the following sol, all the remaining engineering data collected during the flight, as well as some low-resolution black-and-white imagery from the helicopter¡¯s own Navigation Camera, could be downlinked to JPL. The third sol of this phase, the two images taken by the helicopter¡¯s high-resolution color camera should arrive. The Mars Helicopter team will use all information available to determine when and how to move forward with their next test.¡°Mars is hard,¡± said Aung. ¡°Our plan is to work whatever the Red Planet throws at us the very same way we handled every challenge we¡¯ve faced over the past six years ¨C together, with tenacity and a lot of hard work, and a little Ingenuity.¡±A Piece of HistoryWhile Ingenuity will attempt the first powered, controlled flight on another planet, the first powered, controlled flight on Earth took place Dec. 17, 1903, on the windswept dunes of Kill Devil Hill, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Orville and Wilbur Wright covered 120 feet in 12 seconds during the first flight. The Wright brothers made four flights that day, each longer than the previous.A small amount of the material that covered one of the wings of the Wright brothers¡¯ aircraft, known as the Flyer, during the first flight is now aboard Ingenuity. An insulative tape was used to wrap the small swatch of fabric around a cable located underneath the helicopter¡¯s solar panel. The Wrights used the same type of material ¨C an unbleached muslin called ¡°Pride of the West¡± ¨C to cover their glider and aircraft wings beginning in 1901. The Apollo 11 crew flew a different piece of the material, along with a small splinter of wood from the Wright Flyer, to the Moon and back during their iconic mission in July 1969.More About IngenuityThe Ingenuity Mars Helicopter was built by JPL, which also manages the technology demonstration for NASA Headquarters. It is supported by NASA¡¯s Science Mission Directorate, the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, and the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate. NASA¡¯s Ames Research Center and Langley Research Center provided significant flight performance analysis and technical assistance.At NASA Headquarters, Dave Lavery is the program executive for the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter. At JPL, MiMi Aung is the project manager and J. (Bob) Balaram is chief engineer.Bring the excitement of Ingenuity into classrooms and homes through NASA¡¯s Office of STEM Engagement toolkit.

"NASA Mega Moon Rocket Passes Key Test, Readies for Launch",,"The largest rocket element NASA has ever built, the core stage of NASA¡¯s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, fired its four RS-25 engines for 8 minutes and 19 seconds Thursday at NASA¡¯s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The successful test, known as a hot fire, is a critical milestone ahead of the agency¡¯s Artemis I mission, which will send an uncrewed Orion spacecraft on a test flight around the Moon and back to Earth, paving the way for future Artemis missions with astronauts.Engineers designed the eight-part Green Run test campaign to gradually bring the SLS core stage to life for the first time, culminating with the hot fire. The team will use data from the tests to validate the core stage design for flight.¡°The SLS is the most powerful rocket NASA has ever built, and during today¡¯s test the core stage of the rocket generated more than 1.6 million pounds of thrust within seven seconds. The SLS is an incredible feat of engineering and the only rocket capable of powering America¡¯s next-generation missions that will place the first woman and the next man on the Moon,¡± said acting NASA Administrator Steve Jurczyk. ¡°Today¡¯s successful hot fire test of the core stage for the SLS is an important milestone in NASA¡¯s goal to return humans to the lunar surface ¨C and beyond.¡±NASA previously conducted a hot fire test of the SLS core stage Jan. 16. The four RS-25 engines fired together for the first time for about one minute before the test ended earlier than planned. Following data analysis, NASA determined a second, longer hot fire test would provide valuable data to help verify the core stage design for flight, while posing minimal risk to the Artemis I core stage.During the second hot fire test, the stage fired the engines for a little more than eight minutes, just like it will during every Artemis launch to the Moon. The longer duration hot fire tested a variety of operational conditions, including moving the four engines in specific patterns to direct thrust and powering the engines up to 109% power, throttling down and back up, as they will during flight.¡°This longer hot fire test provided the wealth of data we needed to ensure the SLS core stage can power every SLS rocket successfully,¡± said John Honeycutt, manager for the SLS Program at NASA¡¯s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ¡°During this test, the team conducted new operations with the core stage for the first time, repeated some critical operations, and recorded test data that will help us verify the core stage is ready for the first and future SLS flights for NASA¡¯s Artemis program.¡±The two propellant tanks in the SLS core stage collectively hold more than 733,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to help fuel the RS-25 engines at the bottom of the stage. The core stage has a complex network of flight software and avionics systems designed to help fly, track, and steer the rocket during launch and flight. Prior tests in the Green Run test series evaluated the integrated functionality and performance of the core stage¡¯s avionics systems, propulsion systems, and hydraulic systems.¡°Today is a great day for NASA, Stennis and this nation¡¯s human space exploration program. This final test in the Green Run series represents a major milestone for this nation¡¯s return to the Moon and eventual mission to Mars,¡± said Stennis Center Director Richard Gilbrech. ¡°So many people across the agency and the nation contributed to this SLS core stage, but special recognition is due to the blended team of test operators, engineers, and support personnel for an exemplary effort in conducting the test today.¡±Test teams at Stennis supervised a network of 114 tanker trucks and six propellant barges that provided liquid propellant through the B-2 Test Stand to the core stage. Test teams also delivered operational electrical power, supplied more than 330,000 gallons of water per minute to the stand¡¯s flame deflector, and monitored structural interfaces of both the hardware and the stand.Testing the SLS rocket¡¯s core stage is a combined effort for NASA and its industry partners. Boeing is the prime contractor for the core stage and Aerojet Rocketdyne is the prime contractor for the RS-25 engines.Next, the core stage for SLS will be refurbished, then shipped to NASA¡¯s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. There, the core stage will be assembled with the solid rocket boosters and other parts of the rocket and NASA¡¯s Orion spacecraft on the mobile launcher inside the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy in preparation for Artemis I.SLS, Orion, and the ground systems at Kennedy, along with the human landing system and the Gateway in orbit around the Moon, are NASA¡¯s backbone for deep space exploration. SLS is the only rocket that can send Orion, astronauts, and supplies to the Moon on a single mission. The exploration of the Moon with NASA¡¯s Artemis program includes preparations to send astronauts to Mars as part of America¡¯s Moon to Mars exploration approach.",,Sean Potter,19-Mar-21,

NASA¡¯s Perseverance Rover Gives High-Definition Panoramic View of Landing Site,,"NASA¡¯s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover got its first high-definition look around its new home in Jezero Crater on Feb. 21, after rotating its mast, or ¡°head,¡± 360 degrees, allowing the rover¡¯s Mastcam-Z instrument to capture its first panorama after touching down on the Red Planet on Feb 18. It was the rover¡¯s second panorama ever, as the rover¡¯s Navigation Cameras, or Navcams, also located on the mast, captured a 360-degree view on Feb. 20.Mastcam-Z is a dual-camera system equipped with a zoom function, allowing the cameras to zoom in, focus, and take high-definition video, as well as panoramic color and 3D images of the Martian surface. With this capability, the robotic astrobiologist can provide a detailed examination of both close and distant objects.The cameras will help scientists assess the geologic history and atmospheric conditions of Jezero Crater and will assist in identifying rocks and sediment worthy of a closer look by the rover¡¯s other instruments. The cameras also will help the mission team determine which rocks the rover should sample and collect for eventual return to Earth in the future.Stitched together from 142 images, the newly released panorama reveals the crater rim and cliff face of an ancient river delta in the distance. The camera system can reveal details as small as 0.1 to 0.2 inches (3 to 5 millimeters) across near the rover and 6.5 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) across in the distant slopes along the horizon.The detailed composite image shows a Martian surface that appears similar to images captured by previous NASA rover missions.¡°We¡¯re nestled right in a sweet spot, where you can see different features similar in many ways to features found by Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity at their landing sites,¡± said Jim Bell of Arizona State University¡¯s School of Earth and Space Exploration, the instrument¡¯s principal investigator.

NASA Conducts Test of SLS Rocket Core Stage for Artemis I Moon Mission,,"Editor's Note: This release was updated on Jan. 21 to correct the amount of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen loaded from 733,000 pounds to 733,000 gallons.NASA conducted a hot fire Saturday of the core stage for the agency¡¯s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will launch the Artemis I mission to the Moon. The hot fire is the final test of the Green Run series.The test plan called for the rocket¡¯s four RS-25 engines to fire for a little more than eight minutes ¨C the same amount of time it will take to send the rocket to space following launch. The team successfully completed the countdown and ignited the engines, but the engines shut down a little more than one minute into the hot fire. Teams are assessing the data to determine what caused the early shutdown, and will determine a path forward.For the test, the 212-foot core stage generated 1.6 million pounds of thrust, while anchored in the B-2 Test Stand at NASA¡¯s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The hot fire test included loading 733,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen ¨C mirroring the launch countdown procedure ¨C and igniting the engines.""Saturday¡¯s test was an important step forward to ensure that the core stage of the SLS rocket is ready for the Artemis I mission, and to carry crew on future missions,¡± said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who attended the test. ¡°Although the engines did not fire for the full duration, the team successfully worked through the countdown, ignited the engines, and gained valuable data to inform our path forward.¡±Support teams across the Stennis test complex provided high-pressure gases to the test stand, delivered all operational electrical power, supplied more than 330,000 gallons of water per minute to protect the test stand flame deflector and ensure the structural integrity of the core stage, and captured data needed to evaluate the core stage performance.¡°Seeing all four engines ignite for the first time during the core stage hot fire test was a big milestone for the Space Launch System team¡± said John Honeycutt, the SLS program manager at NASA¡¯s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ¡°We will analyze the data, and what we learned from today¡¯s test will help us plan the right path forward for verifying this new core stage is ready for flight on the Artemis I mission.¡±  The Green Run series of tests began in January 2020, when the stage was delivered from NASA¡¯s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans and installed in the B-2 test stand at Stennis. The team completed the first of the eight tests in the Green Run series before standing down in March due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. After resuming work in May, the team worked through the remaining tests in the series, while also standing down periodically as six tropical storms or hurricanes affected the Gulf Coast. Each test built upon the previous test with increasing complexity to evaluate the stages¡¯ sophisticated systems, and the hot fire test that lit up all four engines was the final test in the series.¡°Stennis has not witnessed this level of power since the testing of Saturn V stages in the 1960s,¡± said Stennis Center Director Rick Gilbrech. ¡°Stennis is the premier rocket propulsion facility that tested the Saturn V first and second stages that carried humans to the Moon during the Apollo Program, and now, this hot fire is exactly why we test like we fly and fly like we test. We will learn from today¡¯s early shutdown, identify any corrections if needed, and move forward.¡±In addition to analyzing the data, teams also will inspect the core stage and its four RS-25 engines before determining the next steps. Under the Artemis program, NASA is working to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon in 2024.

NASA to Air Departure of Upgraded SpaceX Cargo Dragon from Space Station,,"Editor's Note: This advisory was updated on Jan. 11 to reflect the new targeted departure date and the correct weight of returning science and cargo. The SpaceX Dragon that arrived to the International Space Station on the company¡¯s 21st resupply services mission for NASA is scheduled to depart on Tuesday, Jan. 12, loaded with 4,400 pounds of scientific experiments and other cargo. NASA Television and the agency¡¯s website will broadcast its departure live beginning at 8 a.m. EST.The upgraded Dragon spacecraft will execute the first undocking of a U.S. commercial cargo craft from the International Docking Adapter about 8:40 a.m., with NASA astronaut Victor Glover monitoring aboard the station. Dragon will fire its thrusters to move a safe distance from the station¡¯s space-facing port of the Harmony module, then initiate a deorbit burn to begin its re-entry sequence into Earth¡¯s atmosphere. Dragon is expected to make its parachute-assisted splashdown around  8:14 p.m. Wednesday, Jan. 13 ¨C the first return of a cargo resupply spacecraft in the Atlantic Ocean. The deorbit burn and splashdown will not air on NASA TV.Splashing down off the coast of Florida enables quick transportation of the science aboard the capsule to the agency¡¯s Kennedy Space Center¡¯s Space Station Processing Facility, and back into the hands of the researchers. This shorter transportation timeframe allows researchers to collect data with minimal loss of microgravity effects. For splashdowns in the Pacific Ocean, quick-return science cargo is processed at SpaceX¡¯s facility in McGregor, Texas, and delivered to NASA¡¯s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Dragon launched Dec. 6 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Launch Complex 39A at NASA¡¯s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, arriving at the station just over 24 hours later and achieving the first autonomous docking of a U.S. commercial cargo resupply spacecraft. Previous arriving cargo Dragon spacecraft were captured and attached to the space station by astronauts operating the station¡¯s robotic Canadarm2. The spacecraft delivered more than 6,400 pounds of hardware, research investigations and crew supplies.The upgraded cargo Dragon capsule used for this mission contains double the powered locker availability of previous capsules, allowing for a significant increase in the research that can be carried back to Earth.Some of the scientific investigations Dragon will return to Earth include:Cardinal HeartMicrogravity causes changes in the workload and shape of the human heart, and it is still unknown whether these changes could become permanent if a person lived more than a year in space. Cardinal Heart studies how changes in gravity affect cardiovascular cells at the cellular and tissue level using 3D-engineered heart tissues, a type of tissue chip. Results could provide new understanding of heart problems on Earth, help identify new treatments, and support development of screening measures to predict cardiovascular risk prior to spaceflight.Space OrganogenesisThis investigation from JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) demonstrates the growth of 3D organ buds from human stem cells to analyze changes in gene expression. Cell cultures on Earth need supportive materials or forces to achieve 3D growth, but in microgravity, cell cultures can expand into three dimensions without those devices. Results from this investigation could demonstrate advantages of using microgravity for cutting-edge developments in regenerative medicine and may contribute to the establishment of technologies needed to create artificial organs.Sextant NavigationThe sextant used in the Sextant Navigation experiment will be returning to Earth. Sextants have a small telescope-like optical sight to take precise angle measurements between pairs of stars from land or sea, enabling navigation without computer assistance. Sailors have navigated via sextants for centuries, and NASA¡¯s Gemini missions conducted the first sextant sightings from a spacecraft. This investigation tested specific techniques for using a sextant for emergency navigation on spacecraft such as NASA¡¯s Orion, which will carry humans on deep-space missions.Rodent Research-23This experiment studies the function of arteries, veins, and lymphatic structures in the eye and changes in the retina of mice before and after spaceflight. The aim is to clarify whether these changes impair visual function. At least 40 percent of astronauts experience vision impairment known as Spaceflight-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS) on long-duration spaceflights, which could adversely affect mission success.Thermal Amine ScrubberThis technology demonstration tested a method to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from air aboard the International Space Station, using actively heated and cooled amine beds. Controlling CO2 levels on the station reduces the likelihood of crew members experiencing symptoms of CO2 buildup, which include fatigue, headache, breathing difficulties, strained eyes, and itchy skin.Bacterial Adhesion and CorrosionBacteria and other microorganisms have been shown to grow as biofilm communities in microgravity. This experiment identifies the bacterial genes used during biofilm growth, examines whether these biofilms can corrode stainless steel, and evaluates the effectiveness of a silver-based disinfectant. This investigation could provide insight into better ways to control and remove resistant biofilms, contributing to the success of future long-duration spaceflights.",,Sean Potter,5-Jan-21,

NASA Conducts Test of SLS Rocket Core Stage for Artemis I Moon Mission,,"This release was updated on Jan. 21 to correct the amount of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen loaded from 733,000 pounds to 733,000 gallons.NASA conducted a hot fire Saturday of the core stage for the agency¡¯s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will launch the Artemis I mission to the Moon. The hot fire is the final test of the Green Run series.The test plan called for the rocket¡¯s four RS-25 engines to fire for a little more than eight minutes ¨C the same amount of time it will take to send the rocket to space following launch. The team successfully completed the countdown and ignited the engines, but the engines shut down a little more than one minute into the hot fire. Teams are assessing the data to determine what caused the early shutdown, and will determine a path forward.For the test, the 212-foot core stage generated 1.6 million pounds of thrust, while anchored in the B-2 Test Stand at NASA¡¯s Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The hot fire test included loading 733,000 gallons of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen ¨C mirroring the launch countdown procedure ¨C and igniting the engines.""Saturday¡¯s test was an important step forward to ensure that the core stage of the SLS rocket is ready for the Artemis I mission, and to carry crew on future missions,¡± said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who attended the test. ¡°Although the engines did not fire for the full duration, the team successfully worked through the countdown, ignited the engines, and gained valuable data to inform our path forward.¡±Support teams across the Stennis test complex provided high-pressure gases to the test stand, delivered all operational electrical power, supplied more than 330,000 gallons of water per minute to protect the test stand flame deflector and ensure the structural integrity of the core stage, and captured data needed to evaluate the core stage performance.¡°Seeing all four engines ignite for the first time during the core stage hot fire test was a big milestone for the Space Launch System team¡± said John Honeycutt, the SLS program manager at NASA¡¯s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. ¡°We will analyze the data, and what we learned from today¡¯s test will help us plan the right path forward for verifying this new core stage is ready for flight on the Artemis I mission.¡±  The Green Run series of tests began in January 2020, when the stage was delivered from NASA¡¯s Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans and installed in the B-2 test stand at Stennis. The team completed the first of the eight tests in the Green Run series before standing down in March due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. After resuming work in May, the team worked through the remaining tests in the series, while also standing down periodically as six tropical storms or hurricanes affected the Gulf Coast. Each test built upon the previous test with increasing complexity to evaluate the stages¡¯ sophisticated systems, and the hot fire test that lit up all four engines was the final test in the series.¡°Stennis has not witnessed this level of power since the testing of Saturn V stages in the 1960s,¡± said Stennis Center Director Rick Gilbrech. ¡°Stennis is the premier rocket propulsion facility that tested the Saturn V first and second stages that carried humans to the Moon during the Apollo Program, and now, this hot fire is exactly why we test like we fly and fly like we test. We will learn from today¡¯s early shutdown, identify any corrections if needed, and move forward.¡±In addition to analyzing the data, teams also will inspect the core stage and its four RS-25 engines before determining the next steps. Under the Artemis program, NASA is working to land the first woman and the next man on the Moon in 2024. SLS and the Orion spacecraft that will carry astronauts to space, along with the human landing system and the Gateway in orbit around the Moon, are NASA¡¯s backbone for deep space exploration.",,Karen Northon,17-Jan-21,
ENAV AND LEONARDO: FIRST SATELLITE NAVIGATION PROCEDURES FOR HELICOPTERS IN APULIA - ITALY,,"ENAV and Leonardo have tested and validated the PBN (Performance Based Navigation) procedure for the Foggia ¨C Tremiti S. Domino Island route in the Apulia region (Southern Italy). This was carried out with an AW169 helicopter operated by Alidaunia, a company providing transport services to and from the Tremiti Islands, as well as emergency medical service missions which support the relevant local community.PBN procedures, carried out through advanced satellite navigation and aircraft avionics, significantly contribute to air space optimisation delivering greater flight operation safety thanks to greater navigation, approach and landing precision and accuracy, a key enabler particularly in certain weather conditions. PBN is combined or replaces the more traditional land-based radio navigation systems. Moreover, PBN procedures ensure a reduction in polluting emissions and noise through dedicated routes and lower fuel consumption. Passenger transport, emergency medical service and rescue, disaster relief operations, surveillance and fire-fighting are among the main applications that can benefit from this technology, in all-weather conditions, day and night. Its adoption and implementation significantly enhance flight safety, environment protection, public service flexibility, responsiveness and effectiveness, and air transport efficiency.The Foggia - Tremiti S. Domino Island route is the first in a network that is being developed locally to support the helicopter operations of the regional heliport network called Rete Eliportuale Puglia. The successfully validated procedures, using a latest generation Leonardo AW169 helicopter, are the result of a collaboration between Alidaunia and GSA (European Global Navigation Satellite Systems Agency) in the framework of the PHAR project (PBN for Hems in the Apulia Region). The procedures will be characterised by high precision linked to the use of special navigation requirements that will allow safe flight even at low altitude, reducing polluting emissions and noise, integrating helicopter and aircraft operations, with an optimized use of airspace.ENAV, the Italian air navigation service provider, has been at the forefront of PBN procedures design for both fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft for years. Leonardo, a leading company in the field of aerospace, defence and security producing latest generation helicopters equipped with state-of-the-art avionics and advanced satellite navigation capabilities, such as the AW169, is one of the few manufacturers in the world today able to codify and produce PBN navigation databases.Alidaunia, always at the forefront in the development and implementation of new technologies, draws important operational benefits in the development of PBN routes ensuring significant advantages in terms of H24 operation and in marginal weather conditions. The demonstration activity in Apulia is the first one carried out since the signing of the Letter of Intent between ENAV and Leonardo announced in October 2020, aimed at offering helicopter operators, in Italy and abroad, products and services in the advanced instrument navigation field, whilst also contributing to modernise the relevant infrastructures. These capabilities, provided through the collaboration between two major players in the aeronautical field, now make possible the development and use of procedures in accordance with the modern requirements of the Performance Based Navigation to support the different phases of flights, increasing safety and operational effectiveness. ENAVENAV is the Italian air navigation service provider, ensuring safety and reliability 24/7 for the 2 million flights we handle yearly from the control towers of 45 airports and 4 Area Control Centres (ACC).

Leonardo¡¯s drink-can-sized decoy launched from GA-ASI MQ-9,,"Leonardo and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc. (GA-ASI) are working together to bring the world-class protection offered by Leonardo¡¯s BriteCloud expendable active decoy to operators of the MQ-9 remotely-piloted aircraft system (RPAS). The joint activity is addressing the growing market need to protect the high-value unmanned aircraft from modern, radar-guided threats as they carry out their missions.Progress has already been made, with a number of BriteCloud rounds successfully launched from an MQ-9 in an aircraft survivability ¡®carriage and release¡¯ trial, designed to ensure that the decoy can be dispensed safely from the platform¡¯s new Self-Protect Pod. Discussions are underway concerning further tests with live rounds to demonstrate that BriteCloud can effectively protect the MQ-9 against the most advanced radio frequency (RF) threats.BriteCloud is a next-generation decoy, protecting aircraft from the latest radar-guided threats. The world¡¯s first, and currently only, such product proven to work effectively, BriteCloud packs sophisticated jamming technology into a package the size of a drinks can, allowing it to be fired from an aircraft in the same manner as a flare. Designed and manufactured in the UK, it was first adopted for service by the Royal Air Force following an extensive testing campaign. As a unique capability, it is now being evaluated by the US Armed Forces under the US Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) programme.BriteCloud is available in different variants for a range of aircraft types. BriteCloud 218 (2x1x8 inch ¡®brick¡¯ round) is the version compatible with the MQ-9¡¯s dispensing system and is also suitable for US-manufactured combat jets such as the F-15 and F-16. Meanwhile, the BriteCloud 55 variant is suitable for 55mm round-format dispensers on aircraft such as the Eurofighter Typhoon, Saab Gripen E and Tornado GR4. A third variant, 55-T, is currently under development for transport aircraft and helicopters.BriteCloud employs Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) jamming technology, considered the ¡®gold standard¡¯ of protection against radar-guided surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles. This technology allows the BriteCloud round to sense and process incoming radar signals and, in response, develop and transmit a highly-convincing electronic ¡®ghost¡¯ signal, fooling threat radars into following the decoy rather than the aircraft.","The two companies are working together to make Leonardo¡¯s BriteCloud 218 decoy available as an off-the-shelf protection option for MQ-9 operators

"First live launch of Leonardo¡¯s BriteCloud 218 decoy from Airbus target drone is a success, say German Armed Forces",,"A recent trial, which saw the German Armed Forces launching a Leonardo BriteCloud 218 decoy from an Airbus RPATS test platform, to evaluate its potential in protecting flying weapon systems from radar-guided missiles, has been heralded as a success. The trial, which was conducted with support from Airbus, Leonardo and the German analysis and testing firm IABG, saw live BriteCloud 218 rounds ejected from the RPATS during flight, allowing the aircraft to successfully evade missiles equipped with Semi-Active Radar (SAR) seeker technology. BriteCloud is a flare-sized electronic device that protects aircraft from the most modern radar-guided missiles. Launched from a standard countermeasure dispenser, it transmits powerful radio emissions that simulate the missile¡¯s expected target, drawing the threat towards BriteCloud and away from the aircraft. BriteCloud is a world first, with Leonardo the only company to have successfully miniaturised such sophisticated jamming technology into a flare-sized package.The German trial marked the first time BriteCloud has been launched from an RPATS platform. With the trend towards remotely-piloted air systems becoming increasingly valuable assets, attention is turning to protecting them from attack. BriteCloud, which does not require integration, is a cost-effective way to equip such assets with latest-generation jamming capabilities. The decoy is dramatically more effective than traditional chaff countermeasures (radar-reflecting foil), with its on-board computer deploying the latest electronic warfare techniques to protect from modern threats. The BriteCloud 218-variant rounds used during the trial pack this technology into a standard-sized rectangular countermeasure casing measuring two by one by eight inches. This means it is compatible with a range of common dispensers such as the AN/ALE-47, making it possible to economically boost the defences of older F-series jets such as the F-15 and F-16, as well as smaller RPAS platforms. BriteCloud 218 is also currently undergoing the United States Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) programme, led by the US Air National Guard (ANG), which could lead to the decoy entering service with the United States Air Force (USAF) Air Combat Command and other US services. Meanwhile, Leonardo¡¯s original BriteCloud 55 decoy (which is slightly larger and compatible with round 55mm flare dispensers such as those on the Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen), has already gone into active service with the UK¡¯s Royal Air Force. ","The trial proved the ability of Leonardo¡¯s flare-sized electronic device to outwit missiles equipped with Semi-Active Radar (SAR) seeker technology

Leonardo carries out Italy¡¯s first demonstration of a drone with electrically-powered propulsion transporting heavy goods,,"Leonardo continues to experiment in the field of advanced air mobility as it aims to accelerate the introduction of drones into civilian skies and develop innovative drone-based services for Italy and beyond. In a recent collaboration with the Municipality of Turin and D-Flight (an ENAV group company, part owned by Leonardo and Telespazio), Leonardo conducted a series of test flights in which a drone weighing 130kg and powered by an electric propulsion system carried loads of up to 25kg. The demo, which was authorised by ENAC (the Italian Civil Aviation Authority) and took place in the city of Turin, is the next step towards a new model of air transport logistics for medium-range routes, defined as those up to 50km.The project, called ¡°Sumeri: Si Salpa!¡± is the first in Italy and amongst the first in the world in which a remotely-piloted system with these characteristics has flown in an urban environment. It is part of a series of experiments that will lead towards a future in which drones carrying hundreds of kilos of goods will be flown up to 50km by operators using a Beyond Visual Line of Site (BVLOS) control system.Laurent Sissmann, SVP Unmanned Systems at Leonardo, said ¡°This initiative is an expression of Leonardo¡¯s vision to make cities more functional, sustainable and ecologically-friendly through the application of new technologies in the fields of unmanned aircraft and logistics, applications which can also be used in times of emergency, such as those we¡¯ve seen in recent months. Artificial intelligence and automation, combined with Leonardo¡¯s system-level expertise in aeronautics, are enabling us to bring forward exciting new types of air operations in complete safety. We send our warm thanks to the Municipality of Turin, which is taking a leading role in this domain. I would also like to express gratitude to ENAC for their support, which enabled us to deliver this innovative technology trial in full compliance with the relevant safety and security regulations. Last but not least, we are very pleased to see the further development and growth of D-Flight, which contributed its air traffic management platform expertise to the demonstration.¡±The trial incorporated three factors that will be essential in the development of innovative logistics services for urban environments: the high load capacity of the drone, a high level of automation and advanced capabilities for dealing with air traffic management. The benefits to citizens of such services will include faster deliveries, lower costs and, most importantly, reduced pollution due to the drones¡¯ electric propulsion systems.Alessio Quaranta, General Manager of ENAC, said ¡°The experience we have gained from the Sumeri project has improved our ability to implement innovative risk methods that are provided by drone operation regulations. The ability to transport goods via drone in urban areas is an important part of the development of urban and advanced air mobility in Italy. The Sumeri project is part of a national initiative to develop innovative mobility throughout Italy, which ENAC has been working on alongside the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry for Innovation and Digitization and with the active support of major national stakeholders such as Leonardo. It is a model we hope to be able to export across Europe.¡±Marco Pironti, Councillor for Innovation of the city of Turin, said ¡°Urban air mobility is at the forefront of our mandate to innovate. It is one of the most challenging ¡®smart city¡¯ technologies to develop, but very much an area in which we are keen to push the boundaries through urban experimentation. One of the most interesting use cases for urban air mobility is to allow for the transport of goods from distribution centres to the end customer (the ¡®last mile¡¯) via a variety of modes of transportation, which will have a positive impact for our city, our citizens and our environment. I¡¯m very happy to see the Sumeri project, an international collaboration between our Turin City Labs ecosystem and air mobility project leader Leonardo, is already off to a successful start.The demonstration is being facilitated by an air traffic management software platform developed by D-Flight, which is also providing QR code registration and release services for the experiment. D-Flight is also taking the opportunity to trial a new mobile app that can facilitate mission planning and in-mission tasks. The use of such systems is highlighting the company¡¯s efficient, innovative and practical response to future European regulation on ¡®U-space¡¯, airspace specifically designated for remotely-piloted aircraft. D-Flight offers one of the first operational European software platforms for U-space, allowing traditional aircraft and drones to co-exist in the same airspace.

Leonardo demonstrates helicopter-UAV teaming in the UK with its AW159 Wildcat,,"On 17th September, Leonardo successfully demonstrated unique integrated capabilities between a manned aircraft and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This took place in the UK during Manned-Unmanned Teaming (MUMT) trials between a Leonardo AW159 Wildcat helicopter and a semi-autonomous UAV from Callen-Lenz Associates.In this instance, MUMT is when a helicopter crew controls a UAV from the helicopter like it was an onboard sensor being controlled from the cockpit. By integrating control of the UAV into the Wildcat Mission System, Leonardo was able to minimise the pilots¡¯ workload allowing them to focus more on the mission whilst simultaneously controlling the UAV - this is the first time such an integrated capability has been demonstrated in the UK on a military aircraft. A ¡®Gateway Processor¡¯ supplied by Callen-Lenz Associates was used to interface with its semi-autonomous UAV.The Leonardo solution allows the Wildcat crew to control both the flight path and payload of the UAV (a capability known as Level of Interoperability (LOI) 4) using an efficient and effective task based Human Machine Interface (HMI), rather than the more operator intensive approaches employed on other systems.Combining the strengths of manned and unmanned platforms, MUMT has the potential to play a transformative role by increasing the situational awareness, tempo, lethality, survivability and combat mass of aviation forces, significantly reducing crew workload allowing pilots to focus on the mission at hand.Teaming of manned aircraft with unmanned air systems (Manned Unmanned Teaming MUMT) enhances air support capability in both the Land and Maritime environments. It also enables extended and complex operations to be conducted with a mix of platforms and systems.The demonstration was part of the British Army¡¯s MUMT themed Army Warfighting Experiment (AWE) 19, and was planned and executed by Dstl and took place on Salisbury Plain in September.These trials build on simulation based development conducted under the Dstl funded AMS DE-RISC programme. This successful demonstration is now expected to inform the MUMT capability roadmap for both the UK MoD and Leonardo.Nick Whitney, Managing Director of Leonardo Helicopters (UK), said: ¡°The success of this manned-unmanned trial highlights that Leonardo and the UK MoD are investing together in the future of UK rotorcraft engineering and it demonstrates further the value of a long-term partnering approach in terms of capability development.¡±Bryan Finlay, Technical Partner at Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), stated: ¡°Leonardo and Callen-Lenz have delivered a fantastic demonstration of the integration of a UAV control station into the mission management system of the Wildcat helicopter. The clever design of the human machine interface means that cockpit workload is well managed and the demonstration has successfully de-risked that technology. This is a key step towards realising an effective operational MUMT capability.¡±Maj Benjamin Thomas, Military Adviser Platform Systems Division at Dstl, commented: ¡°The development of the Wildcat integrated MUMT solution has been impressive, culminating in the successful demonstration of the capability on AWE 19 in a series of representative military vignettes. MUMT has undoubtedly the potential to be a game-changing capability for aviation operating in the Land environment, increasing both situational awareness and survivability.¡±The continued development and integration of cutting-edge solutions across all domains of remotely-piloted and autonomous/semi-autonomous systems and technologies, including MUM-T, is a key element of Leonardo¡¯s BeTomorrow2030 Strategic Plan.

NOISE POLLUTION AND SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF UAM,,"Autonomous systems are transforming business and the economy, and their impact on the future will grow with increased integration into our daily lives. Recent advancements in urban air mobility (UAM) ¨C autonomous systems that transport cargo and passengers at low altitudes in urban and suburban areas ¨C are moving us toward a safer and more efficient transportation future. However, the momentum of this evolving industry also brings challenges posed by increased urban noise.AUVSI recently hosted an XPONENTIAL 2021 preview webinar on Noise Pollution and Social Acceptance to discuss how the UAM industry can analyze and mitigate noise challenges. Michael McNair, Vice President of Aerospace, SAE Industry Technologies Consortia, spoke about urban noise ecosystem concerns that will impact acceptance of UAM. Onur Bilgen, Assistant Professor, Rutgers University, addressed UAM technology concerns by sharing information about his team¡¯s work on a low-noise propulsion system. Noise perception is contextually dependent. As Michael McNair explained, public perception of sound goes far beyond a simple decibel measurement. Urban sounds range from accepted ambient sounds, to workable understood sounds, to unwanted extraneous sounds ¨C but the way people perceive and categorize sounds along this range is not fixed. Because perception of noise is impacted by culture, emotion, and stimuli from other senses, perception of sound varies as these factors change over time and between places. Adding to this complexity is the challenge of identifying shifting values ¨C sounds that are considered tolerable in today¡¯s urban landscapes may not be tomorrow and sounds that are not tolerated today may be an expected part of daily life in the cities of the future.  Noise management solutions vary by need.With noise already a part of urban landscapes, the UAM industry must distinguish between acceptable noises and those that must be limited, and then determine a workable way to do so. The first option is to reduce noise at the source by altering the number of rotors, rotor design, or rotor speed. Large UAM systems like air taxis involve complex rotors that produce more structure-born sound than smaller drone systems. Current commercial market solutions that control vibration or pitch do not always sufficiently reduce sound for operations in certain areas and come with technological disadvantages. Dr. Bilgen explained how his team at Rutgers is working to reduce the level of sound emitted from rotors using piezocomposite blades. Piezoelectric materials change shape when electricity is applied, thereby offering solutions for thrust vectoring, acoustic sound, and vibration control. Systems that incorporate this technology could see increased bandwidth, more compact packaging, reduced fabrication and maintenance costs, increased functionality, and even reduced power consumption. The second option is to abate noise in unwanted areas by managing UAM routes, arrival and departure times, and aircraft distancing. While conventional commercial flight is already restricted by noise abatement operations in place at airports, UAM brings its own challenges with increased air density, lower flight altitudes, and flight paths that are closer to people and buildings. FAA is working to identify UAM needs and is expected to update flight standards in the coming years. The third option is to accommodate the local community¡¯s expectations and tolerance level. UAM operations could be restricted by curfews, limits on the types of operations allowed, or quotas that decrease the total number of aircraft in operation. Finally, noise can be reduced in specific regions through land use planning. Urban areas can zone airspace as high-density regions near multimodal transit hubs or noise-sensitive regions away from these services. The UAM industry must collaborate toward assured autonomy. With so many noise management options to choose from, it is clear that solutions will vary between urban areas depending on noise perception and overall acceptance of UAM systems. As UAM technology advances, so must discussions on the future of UAM integration in our daily lives and within a multimodal transit system. By collaborating toward consensus-driven standards, industry stakeholders can adopt a holistic approach that addresses noise concerns and ushers UAM toward a future of assured autonomy. XPONENTIAL 2021 offers attendees an opportunity to hear more about this topic from thought leaders, technology experts, and policymakers. Register now for the event¡¯s virtual educational programming in May to continue this discussion on noise pollution and social acceptance. ",,AUVSI NEWS,6-Apr-21,

ASSESSING THE OUTLOOK FOR PILOT DEMAND,,"As we approach the end of 2020, I¡¯m sure a collective sigh of relief will ring out. The year has not been kind to our health, personal freedoms and, for most people, professional opportunities. So I know I¡¯m not alone in being grateful for the approaching end of the year and start of 2021.The start of 2021 will be met with ongoing restrictions, but the New Year provides a useful milestone to look forward and assess the outlook. For the first time since the start of the pandemic, forecasts and reports about the aviation industry¡¯s recovery are aligning around a more positive picture in the short to mid-term.IATA has been predicting a return to 2019 levels by 2023 and with the recent positive news about the efficacy and arrival of vaccines, this looks to be realistic. Other commentators are predicting an even quicker recovery. It¡¯s too early to assess how the vaccine roll out will support that recovery but there is no doubt that the recovery is underway, and we should see the effects of this from Q2 2021 onwards.IATA forecasts there will be passenger and cargo demand for an additional 9,500 aircraft to fly in 2023 compared to 2021 requiring another 105,000 pilots to be trained in that period.  More immediately, the challenge of distributing the vaccine to the nations of the world is a poignant reminder of the importance of the industry we support.New and existing pilots need continuous development so that when demand does return, they are able to resume their careers with the airlines. To achieve this, L3Harris has launched the ¡®Current and Airline Ready Programme¡¯.  Through the programme, cadets who complete their training will be able to maintain the validity of their licence/rating and continue the development of their professional competencies for up to two years or until they are offered an airline job. It will position them to quickly gain employment when the recovery takes hold and support airlines to more rapidly increase capacity.There is much to provide confidence for the commercial airline industry when looking ahead to the end of 2021 and beyond.

WHY ARE AIRLINES SELECTING FLIGHT RECORDERS WITH INCREASED CAPACITY LIKE THE SRVIVR25? RECORDER SERIES?,,"1. FLIGHTS ARE MUCH LONGER THAN TWO HOURS¡°Majority of flight durations are longer than 2 hours and up to 12 hours - Critical information may be overwritten,¡± stated in the NTSB Safety Recommendation. Many times pilot observations carry across several flights. Having this data available for analysis will help improve safety, training and flight efficiency. ¡°In many air accident and incident investigations, Cockpit Voice Recorder data for the critical phases of flight are not available. This illustrates the necessity to increase, sometimes significantly (15 to 25 hours), the duration of CVR recordings,¡± cited ICAO international. 2. MORE DATA. MORE EFFICIENCIESThe L3Harris SRVIVR25 series provides:>25 hour minimum audio recording>25 hour minimum data link recording>140 hours flight data recording This is the largest amount of data ever available for flight safety, training and maintenance technicians and SRVIVR25 provides a secure, reliable foundation for capturing it. This data enables operators to identify pilot, policies and equipment strategic actions to quickly reduce costs, increase safety as well as apply evidence-based strategic training.  As we all know, correct analysis harnesses the data intelligently to drive measurable results. Now airlines have a robust tool to augment optimization.3. EASY DATA RETRIEVALAircraft equipment is not like smart TVs, it is not possible to stream the data to a mobile phone. As a result, a key focus of the recorder¡¯s development team was to enable operators to efficiently, and rapidly download the large amounts of data the new recorders capture. The embedded Ethernet ports enable a technician to simply plug-in and select the download options using the Recorder Device Interface tablet. This capability reduces maintenance time, does not require additional training nor the removal of the recorder from the aircraft, providing efficiency while saving money.4. THEY¡¯RE RETROFIT READYGiven the vast amount of data retrieval capabilities from the new recorders, some airlines are choosing to upgrade a majority of their fleet with these new devices. The SRVIVR25 series is a direct replacement for devices using the ARINC 747 and 757 based recorders. This enables operators to economically upgrade the cockpit voice and flight data, including the L3Harris FA2100 recorders, on existing aircraft with minimal flight interruption.5. MIXED FLEET COMPATIBILITYThe SRVIVR25 is line-fit on Airbus A320/A320/A330/A350 and A380 platforms as well as being selectable on the B737Max, B737 and B777. This, combined with the retrofit capability, allows airlines who prefer fleet commonality to upgrade their recording capture across their fleet easily and economically.","DEFENSE

"INNOVATIVE EO/IR SENSOR TECHNOLOGY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, OTHER CUSTOMERS",,"In just over a decade since its debut, the L3Harris WESCAM MX?-10 electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) system has changed and expanded the way our airborne law enforcement and other customers use the technology across air, land and maritime domains.Prior to the introduction of the WESCAM MX?-10, the Airborne Law Enforcement (ALE) market relied on a single supplier who offered simple gimbal technology ¨C a 2-axis turret without a passive isolator and with an external inertial measurement unit (IMU).The WESCAM MX-10 innovated that ALE market by adapting L3Harris¡¯ core, field-proven technology from larger, more complex products. This smaller, capable and affordable commercial sensor system incorporates concepts from the larger WESCAM MX-15 and -20 products, including a 4-axis turret with an internal passive isolator and an optical bench-mounted IMU. Adaptable and versatile, the MX-10 delivers industry-leading operational effectiveness and reliability.Innovative EO/IR Sensor Technology for Law Enforcement, Other Customers Big Benefits Across Air, Land and Maritime Domains The ALE market was eager to use augmented reality (AR) moving systems to overlay street names and other geographical information dynamically onto live video. AR systems became the moving map of choice for ALE operators. Those systems require close registration between the map and the video, which in turn, requires accurate and stable geo-pointing performance from the sensor. The WESCAM MX-10 uniquely delivers the geo-pointing performance required by AR moving maps in its size class.The system provides the best target detection, recognition, and identification (DRI) range performance in its class, as well as the most accurate and stable target geo-location performance. This is a function of the cameras themselves, as well as the stabilization performance of the gimbal.Price competitive in the demanding ALE market space, the WESCAM MX-10 gained a loyal following given performance, reliability and support benefits customers experienced over time.  From patrol to search and rescue, surveillance to fire assist and anti-poaching missions, the benefits and versatility of the system supports the important work performed by the operators in making the world a safer place for people and wildlife alike. See more in the Best of WESCAM MX-10 video below.¡°L3Harris products have helped me in burglaries and robberies, day and night foot pursuits, weapons locations, stolen vehicle confirmation, and added protection for units on approach,¡± said Deputy Sheriff/Pilot Doug Brimmer of the San Bernardino County Sheriff¡¯s Department. ¡°When there is a scheduled protest, we can use the camera system, including the additional zoomed-in lens, from a further vantage point. We can then use the downlink system to broadcast our video feed to a fixed or handheld waypoint. In terms of search and rescue, we locate hikers in valleys, mountains and in the desert. We have located a plane crash at night thanks to IR picking up heat from the engine.¡±The WESCAM MX-10 is prevalent throughout the ALE market space. Further, L3Harris continues to see increased demand for system variants on domestic and international front line military platforms in air, maritime and land domains.L3Harris leverages and adapts core technology to multi-domain environments such as inverted variants for ground and maritime applications, which continue to meet size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements.L3Harris leverages and adapts core technology to multi-domain environments such as inverted variants for ground and maritime applications, which continue to meet size, weight and power (SWaP) requirements.

Survey indicates summer lift-off for UK flyers,,"A survey of 2,100 people across the UK suggests there is a strong desire among UK flyers to return to domestic and international travel as soon as restrictions are eased by the Government ¨C an easing planned for 17 May. The survey, which took place on the weekend following the Prime Minister issuing the Government¡¯s roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions, builds on the spike of new bookings made by the British public since 22nd February, and could indicate a resurgence for the UK travel industry.2,014 people were surveyed online for the study, by Yonder Data Solutions, on 26-28 February 2021. The survey was weighted to be nationally representative of the UK, according to the company.The survey results showed a willingness to adapt to the post-Covid landscape, with three quarters of respondents accepting the need to supply a negative Covid test prior to travel, if required. Three quarters of those surveyed also said they would be willing to carry proof that they had been vaccinated if it meant being allowed to travel. Amongst those aged over 65 the number rises to 89%, but for 18-24 year olds it is 67% ¨C which may indicate that overall acceptance will increase once every adult in the UK receives their first vaccination by July.Commenting on the survey, Robert Sinclair, CEO of London City Airport, said: ¡°After the weakest first quarter that anyone in the industry can remember, the survey results show that the Prime Minister¡¯s roadmap has given British people hope again, and it is very pleasing to see that so many see travel as a priority as restrictions are eased.¡°It has also given our airline partners confidence to schedule services throughout the summer and I am delighted that we will be able to connect travellers to so many destinations across the UK and Europe for the most well-deserved summer holiday they will ever have.¡°The challenge now for industry and Government is to make sure that May 17th is not another false dawn and to agree travel standards with our key international partners as soon as possible, which will allow everyone to fly safely from early summer. And when this is achieved, I would anticipate another surge in bookings that will not only be a huge shot in the arm for the industry, but demonstrate that we can finally begin our recovery.¡±Looking ahead to the summer, the emerging picture from the survey points to a preference for short-haul holidays, with 55% of frequent flyers preferring Europe and the Mediterranean, compared to 22% who aspire to travel long haul.This potential trend is supported by 71% of those surveyed indicating that travel should be allowed between the UK and countries where Covid-19 is under control, opening up the possibility of travel corridors between the UK and European countries where risk is low.In preparation for the restart of international travel, the airport¡¯s home-based carrier, British Airways, has announced a route map of 24 destinations.

Agility Prime Researches Electronic Parachute Powered by Machine Learning,,"The Air Force¡¯s Agility Prime program awarded a phase I small business technology transfer (STTR) research contract to Jump Aero and Caltech to create an electronic parachute powered by machine learning that would allow the pilot to recalibrate the flight controller in midair in the event of damage, the company announced on April 7.¡°The electronic parachute is the name for the concept of implementing an adaptive/machine-learned control routine that would be impractical to certify for the traditional controller for use only in an emergency recovery mode ¡ª something that would be switched on by the pilot if there is reason to believe that the baseline flight controller is not properly controlling the aircraft (if, for example, the aircraft has been damaged in midair),¡± Carl Dietrich, founder and president of Jump Aero Incorporated, told Avionics International.This technology was previously difficult to certify because of the need for deterministic proof of safety within these complex systems. The research was sparked when the Federal Aviation Administration certified an autonomous landing function for use in emergency situations which created a path for the possible certification of electronic parachute technology, according to Jump Aero.The machine-learned neural network can be trained with non-linear behaviors that occur in an aircraft in the presence of substantial failures such those generated by a bird strike, Dietrich said. Once trained with these simulated failures, the controller could select the appropriate control laws.¡°The neural network would learn new operating limits and effector gain mapping in the presence of these simulated failures,¡± Dietrich said. ¡°The adaptive aspect of the controller would in effect select the appropriate pre-learned control laws that the DNN discovered through the training of the simulated failures.   The goal is to optimally map the original command structure of the baseline controller onto the new controller with the fundamental limitations of the new plant model ¡ª so the aircraft response would be as close as possible to what the pilot expects ¡ª thereby improving the probability of a safe landing.¡±This technology is still in early-stage work, Dietrich said, however, Caltech has created similar adaptive controllers which could help in the development of the electronic parachute.¡°This particular research could lead to the first application of an adaptive/ML controller to a piloted aircraft in the form of a recovery function (or 'electronic parachute') if it is carried forward through Phase III,¡± Dietrich said.The electronic parachute could be trailed on Jump Aero¡¯s electronic vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, JAI eVTOL, which is still within the preliminary design stage, Dietrich said. Jump Aero was launched in January 2020 as a solution for first responders.¡°We are starting to test subsystems for the demonstrator and we are in the preliminary design stage of the full-scale aircraft,¡± Dietrich. ¡°If we are awarded a Phase II STTR contract, we would expect to demonstrate this electronic parachute technology on a subscale demonstration aircraft where we can simulate failures and (hopefully) successful recovery at low cost/risk.¡±","Agility Prime, Air Force, Caltech, electronic parachute, Jump Aero",Kelsey Reichmann ,8-Apr-21,

NASA Prepares for Next Step in Mars Ingenuity Helicopter Flight Demonstration,,"NASA¡¯s Ingenuity Mars helicopter has survived as a spacecraft and now its team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is working on its transition into its aircraft duties that could lead it to accomplish the first flight on Mars. Ingenuity is a small 4-pound helicopter with 4-foot long carbon fiber blades powered by six lithium-ion batteries. It is currently still attached to the belly of the Perseverance Rover that landed in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18. ¡°This is, in effect, an aircraft that also happens to be a spacecraft,¡± J. Bob Balaram, Ingenuity chief engineer at JPL, said during a press conference remotely hosted by NASA on March 23. ¡°It has survived launch. It has survived the journey through space with vacuum and radiation. It has survived the entry and descent and landing on the surface on the bottom of the Perseverance rover and it has survived all of the challenges and design issues that are necessary for a spacecraft. But most of all I think of Ingenuity also as an experimental aircraft.¡± On Sunday NASA released a photo taken by Perseverance's robotic arm showing the debris shield that once covered Ingenuity on the ground. The debris shield, a protective covering on the bottom of NASA¡¯s Perseverance rover, was released on March 21, 2021, the 30th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. (NASA)¡°The coolest thing is you can see Ingenuity there all tucked in below the rover doing okay, everything is all in place, and she's ready to get to the surface of Mars,¡± Farah Alibay, Perseverance integration lead for Ingenuity at JPL, said. Now, Perseverance is in the process of driving Ingenuity to its airfield. Ingenuity¡¯s team at JPL began scouting an airfield within several hours of Perseverance's landing, H?vard Grip, Ingenuity chief pilot at JPL, said. They needed an area that was flat with few obstacles to make it safe for take-off and landing. They also needed an area within the larger flight zone that was flat but also had texture for the helicopter¡¯s cameras and sensors to navigate with. This image shows where NASA¡¯s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter team will attempt its test flights. Helicopter engineers added the locations for the rover landing site, the airfield (the area where the helicopter will take off and return), and the flight zone (the area within which it will fly) on an image taken by the High Resolution Imaging Experiment (HiRISE) camera aboard NASA¡¯s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. (NASA)¡°We began to look for an airfield and the surrounding flight zone first using satellite imagery and then, as it became available, images taken by the rover itself after it landed, and we began to realize that we might just have a really great airfield, right in front of our noses,¡± Grip said. ¡°We've really scoured this area we looked at every little rock and pebble within that airfield and measured it, before we finally were comfortable saying, Yes, this is, this is going to be our home base for the helicopter.¡± Once Perseverance reaches the airfield there will be a 10-day sequence of critical deployments ending with Ingenuity being placed on the surface and Perseverance driving away. The location where NASA¡¯s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover will observe the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter¡¯s attempt at powered controlled flight at Mars is called ¡°Van Zyl Overlook,¡± after Jakob van Zyl. Van Zyl was the team¡¯s longtime colleague, mentor, and leader at NASA¡¯s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. He passed away unexpectedly in August 2020, about a month after the launch of Perseverance. (NASA)¡°We are at a milestone right now where we are on the surface,¡± Balaram. ¡°We have successfully exposed ourselves with the atmosphere to the atmosphere of Mars. We are right now in the process of having the rover driver us to our location, which will be our airfield. There will be a long 10-day sequence of careful critical deployments, and then there will be the deposition of the helicopter on the surface.¡± These critical deployments involve turning the aircraft from its current horizontal position to a vertical position before it is placed on the ground, Alibay said. ¡°That's a very prescribed and meticulous process where we separate,¡± Alibay said. ¡°There's a number of launch slots and attachments that we separate one by one. We're going to be imaging each time making sure that the helicopter is in the expected position before dropping it on the ground.¡± With Ingenuity on the ground, Perseverance will drive away, however, this must happen within 25 hours so that sunlight can reach Ingenuity¡¯s solar panels to charge its batteries. This image shows the flight zone of NASA¡¯s Ingenuity Helicopter from the perspective of NASA¡¯s Mars 2020 Perseverance rover. The flight zone is the area within which the helicopter will attempt to fly. (NASA)¡°What's most stressful, is that once the helicopter is separated, we actually have to drive away from it within 25 hours,¡± Alibay said. ¡°...the helicopter needs photons. It needs sun on its solar panels to charge its batteries, and it can only survive one Martian night without that. So that's gonna be a very stressful period but what I look forward to the most is after we do that drive we're going to get that first shot of Ingenuity, on the surface of Mars on her own there and I just cannot wait to get that first picture I think it's going to be a really great moment for the entire team.¡± Ingenuity will then be fully autonomous and wait for JPL to send it commands, Balaram said. It will take a week for the team to test out sensors, server mechanisms, and motors. ¡°We will go through a number of days of commissioning, approximately a week, where we test out sensors, we test out server mechanisms, we test the motors to make sure they spin right, and we'll be very methodical and even driven as this engineering experiment unfolds,¡± Balaram said. ¡°Then we will be at a point where we will undertake our first flight.¡± Grip said the first flight will include a takeoff, climb to an altitude of three meters, a 30-second hover, a turn while hovering, and then landing the aircraft. ¡°First of all, the first flight is special,¡± Grip said. ¡°It's by far the most important flight that we plan to do, it'll be the first powered flight by an aircraft another planet, and we've, in fact met most of our goals for this project, just by getting to the point where we are right now, and will declare complete mission success.¡± Ingenuity will have received its flight plan hours before the flight from JPL. To follow this plan the aircraft will use images taken during the flight to navigate. ¡°It has to work very hard during the flight itself in order to make that happen,¡± Grip said. ¡°In particular, it takes images of the ground below it at a rate of 30 images per second, and analyzes those in order to track the features on the ground, to see how it is moving across the ground. And it combines that with other sensor measurements in order to make tiny adjustments to the controls 500 times per second, to stay exactly on the trajectory that we prescribed for it, and to fight off disturbances that tries to take it away from that trajectory like winds and gusts.¡± If the first flight is successful, there is an opportunity for a second flight. This flight will be planned once data from the first flight is analyzed, Balaram said. The second flight will also have to occur within the 31 Earth days allotted to this experiment. The first flight on Mars will also include history from the first flight on Earth. Ingenuity contains a small piece of fabric from the Wright Brother's spruce wood and fabric system. ¡°We are very proud to honor that experimental aircraft from long ago by carrying a small piece of fabric on Ingenuity,¡± Balaram said. ¡°...This fabric is from the original aircraft that flew at Kitty Hawk.¡± ","Ingenuity, Mars, NASA, Perseverance",Kelsey Reichmann ," March 24, 2021",
GAO Finds Increased Delays and Costs for F-35¡¯s Block 4 Modernization,,"The Department of Defense (DoD) needs an updated modernization schedule and improved data on software development before the F-35 can transition from development to full production leaving the program with more timeline delays and costs, according to a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released on March 18. The F-35 program is currently working on a modernization effort, known as Block 4, where the DoD is delivering capabilities to the warfighter by incrementally developing, testing, and delivering small groups of capabilities every six months, according to the report. This process referred to as C2D2 is based on the Agile software development process. However, the GAO says Block 4¡¯s remaining development schedule is not attainable. An updated timeline for F-35 operational test schedules through 2021. (GAO)The DoD has been working on the Block 4 modernization for three years and continues to expand its timeline and budget. ¡°For example, in 2018, DOD reported that Block 4 development would cost $10.6 billion for fiscal years 2018 through 2024,¡± the report states. ¡°As of September 2020, DOD reported to Congress that all Block 4 costs are expected to exceed $14 billion, spanning fiscal years 2013 through 2027.¡± GAO's team found the timeline estimations that were given were based on estimates formulated at the start of the effort and not according to the contractor¡¯s demonstrated performance. ¡°This decision to change how costs are reported stems from DoD efforts to respond to our recommendation that it improve transparency into the total costs associated with Block 4 development,¡± the report states. ¡°Specifically, in May 2020, we found that DoD¡¯s Block 4 reports to Congress, required by Section 224 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017, did not fully represent the total estimated costs of Block 4 development. DOD focused its reporting of Block 4 costs on the future year defense program and excluded previously incurred costs and any costs expected to be incurred after a 7- year period.¡± The report found delays in the development of the F-35 Joint Simulation Environment, which runs the mission systems software and other software models, resulted in the program¡¯s inability to complete 64 planned tests in 2020. These problems were identified in August 2020 and there is no current timeframe for a fix to the problems found. The simulator delays, which have been further postponed full production from March of this year, are related to high overall open deficiencies, production delays and quality issues, efforts to address Turkey¡¯s removal from the supply chain, and aircraft not meeting reliability and maintainability goals, according to the report.  Despite these problems, the program was able to complete four open-air tests at Point Mugu Sea Range, two of three missile tests, and operational cybersecurity testing, according to the report. Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3), a suite of software and hardware technologies that provide updated processing capability, display units, and increased memory to the aircraft, is on track to be deployed into lot 15 aircraft in 2023, according to the report. The report also found that the program¡¯s Block 4 software development is not following leading practices. The report said Lockheed Martin does not have access to automated tools to capture real-time performance data to make its collected software development metrics helpful. The program also needs performance targets for software metrics, the report found. ¡°While we recognize the challenges with transitioning to Agile development, after three years of effort the F-35 program continues to have issues with effectively implementing the C2D2 approach to develop and deliver Block 4 capabilities,¡± the report states. ¡°The airframe contractor continues to deliver capabilities late, and the remaining schedule contains significant risk and is not achievable based on the pace of past performance. While the program office is committed to delivering capabilities more quickly to the warfighter, the program has not delivered on its initial iterative plan. Without an achievable schedule informed by historical performance, the program is likely to continue falling short of its expectations, and the warfighter will have to wait longer for the promised capabilities.¡±Doug Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, told Avionics International that many of the problems faced by the program such as the new issues addressed in this report are the cause of complexity and growing pains. ¡°It's really, in many ways, the pathfinder for incredibly sophisticated sensor shooter type aircraft and by that I mean, the aircraft has onboard the sensors to gather immense amounts of data wherever it flies, process it onboard, and link to other aircraft to execute its mission and all of the requirements were created in the 90s. The initial kind of baseline was laid out in the 2000s,¡± Birkey said. ¡°And so that was very advanced back then, and there's a learning curve that comes along with it.¡± Birkey said that while the progress of the program hasn¡¯t always been ideal the aircraft is still ultimately important to U.S. defense. ¡°The bottom line takeaway on all this is that the country needs the aircraft,¡± Birkey said. ¡°I mean, the capabilities it brings to the equation, which is really stealth, electronic warfare, and high degree situational awareness and the sensors and processing capability, those attributes are what you need to stay alive in the current environment, and on the fighter side it is the only thing we have in production, that does that.¡± ","Block 4, C2D2, F-35, GAO",Kelsey Reichmann,20-Mar-21,

Northrop¡¯s Integrated Missile Warning System Approved by Army,,"Northrop Grumman¡¯s integrated missile warning system, Common Infrared Countermeasure (CIRCM), has been declared ready for full-rate production and operations by the Army, the company announced. Northrop completed a six-month initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&E) activity before the classification was given from the Army. ¡°Through our partnership with the U.S. Army and our suppliers, we have already delivered over 100 production systems,¡± Bob Gough, vice president, navigation, targeting and survivability at  Northrop Grumman, said in a press statement. ¡°The successful completion of IOT&E confirms CIRCM¡¯s readiness for full-rate production.¡±The CIRCM system will be used on rotary-wing, tilt-rotor, and small fixed-wing aircraft like the UH-60 Black Hawk, CH-47 Chinook, and the AH-64 Apache, Gough said. ¡°CIRCM protects these platforms so they can conduct air assaults, air movements, armed escort, reconnaissance, and security operations,¡± Gough said. ¡°In addition, CIRCM allows rotary-wing aircraft to land and take off from just about anywhere which is essential to the role of medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) teams.¡±  The CIRCM system works autonomously and can protect against man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), Gough said. ¡°Prior to takeoff, the aircrew turns CIRCM on and sets it in a mode to allow laser fire,¡± Gough said. ¡°After this point, CIRCM works autonomously with the missile warning system to quickly defeat missile threats. When CIRCM does acquire and jam a missile, it notifies the aircrew through a message on the glass cockpit and an audio signal, or through a dedicated control panel, depending upon the aircraft installation.¡± Gough said the CIRCM is cued by the missile warning system and then automatically searches and tracks the missile. ¡°CIRCM tracks these fast moving, highly agile missiles with exact precision and then turns on a narrow beam, infrared laser to jam the threat,¡± Gough said. ¡°The laser beam confuses the missile and causes it to quickly steer off course, protecting the aircraft. After missile defeat, CIRCM quickly frees up jamming resources to engage the next missile threat. The whole process from detection to defeat can happen in a few seconds.¡± The system uses an open systems architecture and can work with a variety of missile warning systems, Gough said. It also works with other survivability equipment like flare dispensers. ¡°One of the primary components that enables CIRCM is the missile warning system,¡± Gough said. ¡°The missile warning system detects incoming threat missiles and sends a directional cue to CIRCM. From the start, CIRCM was designed around modular, open systems architecture (MOSA) principles so that it could work with a wide variety of missile warning systems. CIRCM has already been integrated and flight-tested with three different missile warning systems.¡±   ","Army, CIRCM, Northrop Grumman",Kelsey Reichmann ,18-Mar-21,

AiRanger Unmanned Aircraft Gets Sagetech¡¯s Detect and Avoid System,,"Sagetech Avionics and American Aerospace ISR (AA ISR) are partnering to integrate Sagetech¡¯s Detect and Avoid (DAA) system on AA ISR¡¯s AiRanger unmanned aircraft system (UAS), according to a March 10 press release from the company. The prototype will begin testing by the end of 2021 with a certifiable prototype ready in Q1 of 2022, according to the release. ¡°Through the commercialization of our DAA capability, partnerships like our work with AA ISR on the NASA SIO help inform the appropriate physical configuration, such as interfacing with airborne sensors like radar, and ensuring the performance of the system meets the needs of the AiRanger platform as well as the intent of NASA¡¯s integration efforts,¡± Tom Furey, CEO of Sagetech Avionics, told Avionics International via email. ¡°Once the system is complete, it will be compatible with most aircraft platforms without special modification requirements.¡± Furey said Sagetech¡¯s DAA system which at its core is an Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) will be certifiable by the Federal Aviation Administration to TSO-c211. ¡°As members of various RTCA and ASTM committees, we help both inform the standards-making bodies of technological capabilities, and design our products to meet the emerging standards,¡± Furey said. ¡°Other systems identifying themselves as Detect and Avoid solutions are really sensors, which will provide input into a certifiable, ACAS-based solution.¡± The DAA system uses a transponder, interrogator, an ACAS-based DAA computer, software package, and other essential components, according to the release. ¡°ACAS takes cooperative traffic input from passive or active surveillance sensors, which are part of our solution and ensure compatibility with manned aircraft in the NAS [national airspace],¡± Furey said. ¡°Other input comes from non-cooperative sensors such as radar, EO/IR, or acoustic sensors, which are third-party sensors.  The ACAS/DAA system then fuses these sensor inputs, and provides avoidance maneuvers based on sophisticated algorithms developed by MIT Lincoln Labs and Johns Hopkins APL and approved by the FAA.¡±The addition of Sagetech¡¯s DAA system on AA ISR UAS will get the AiRanger closer to receiving type certification from the FAA. ¡°Type certifications require proving the safety of the entire aircraft solution to the FAA,¡± Furey said. ¡°Using components that can be TSO¡¯d (FAA component level certification) simplifies the certification process by eliminating the need to prove the efficacy of individual subsystems.

HyPoint CEO Talks New Hydrogen Fuel Cell Operable Prototype for Electric Aircraft,,"HyPoint has unveiled the first operable prototype version of its turbo air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell system, as the Menlo Park, California-based green energy startup prepares to support validation and testing of its system for a variety of aircraft types and powertrain configurations.Testing has shown that HyPoint¡¯s turbo air-cooled hydrogen fuel cell system will be able to achieve up to 2,000 watts per kilogram of specific power. Dr. Alex Ivanenko, founder and CEO of HyPoint, told Avionics International that their technology has drawn interest from a wide range of aircraft developers from electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) jet makers to other startups developing hydrogen powertrains for turboprop aircraft.Ivanenko said the length of an electric aircraft flight the full-scale version of their fuel cell system can support will depend on a number of different factors.""It depends on configurations, we're looking at a range from two hours to six hours, and we can provide different configurations. Flight time is really a question of hydrogen storage. What kind of hydrogen storage would you like to use? If it¡¯s a gaseous form or liquid form, for example, you'll be able to support a longer or shorter flight,"" Ivanenko said.Among the testing that has already been done by HyPoint on the prototype, they have demonstrated the ability to generate up to 1,500 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density. Thermal management in the fuel cell system is achieved by using bipolar plates and corrosion-resistant coating.A technical white paper published by HyPoint explaining the design of their turbo air-cooled system says that the idea behind their approach is to circulate high-pressure air through a fuel cell stack, or a bundle of fuel cells, and to recirculate the exhaust air. By re-distributing exhaust air across fuel cell stack inlets, they're able to save energy that would otherwise be spent by the system on compressing fresh air.Rendering of the full-scale version in a turboprop engine.""As long as the air contains sufficient oxygen it can be reused,"" the white paper notes.HyPoint also announced that it will begin work with the U.S. Department of Energy¡¯s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to further test and validate its hydrogen fuel cell technology. NREL¡¯s hydrogen and fuel cell research and development focuses on developing, integrating, and demonstrating hydrogen production and delivery, hydrogen storage, and fuel cell technologies for transportation, stationary, and portable applications.""We generate electricity from hydrogen,"" Ivanenko said. ""Our fuel cell system uses a chemical reaction to transform the chemical energy of hydrogen into electricity.""In December 2020, HyPoint was named a winner of NASA¡¯s iTech Initiative, in which inventive technologies were ranked based on criteria that included technical viability, likely impact on future space exploration, benefits to humanity, and commercialization potential. The startup also claims that its high-temperature (HTPEM) fuel cell system is ""three times lighter"" than comparable low-temperature (LTPEM) fuel cell systems.One partner that HyPoint is working with, ZeroAvia, completed a hydrogen-electric aircraft flight in September 2020 and went on to raise $21.4 million from Amazon, Shell, and a Bill Gates-backed fund.¡°The reality is that hydrogen fuel cells are the technological driver behind e-aircraft and we are working closely with the team at HyPoint to test their systems for potential integration into future ZeroAvia aircraft,"" Val Miftakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia said in a March 2 press release.Ivanenko said that the main customers HyPoint will be targeting moving forward include aircraft designers, manufacturers, and powertrain OEMs among others.

Boeing 777s Equipped with Pratt & Whitney 4000 Engines Grounded Following UAL 328,,"Damage to two turbofan blades involved in the in-flight engine failure on United Airlines (UAL) flight 328 are among the initial discoveries in focus by a team of investigators reviewing the incident that occurred shortly after takeoff from Denver International Airport en route to Honolulu, Hawaii Saturday Feb. 19.UAL 328, a Boeing 777-200 carrying 229 passengers and 10 crew members, experienced the engine failure and in-flight fire that went viral in a video on social media posted by a relative to one of the flight¡¯s passengers. The aircraft circled back to DIA once pilots discovered the failure. None of the passengers or crew were injured, and a team including the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), United Airlines, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Independent Brotherhood of Teamsters are now investigating it.NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said that the agency¡¯s preliminary analysis of the engine shows that two of its individual fan blades were damaged. Sumwalt explained how Boeing 777-200 model¡¯s engine, Pratt & Whitney¡¯s PW4077, has 22 fan blades that join together into a hub inside of the containment ring and housed by an exterior cowling¡ªwhich fell off the aircraft along with other debris from the 777 as it returned to DIA.""Two fan blades were found fractured, one fan blade was found fractured at the root where it joins the hub and the other adjacent fan blade was found fractured about mid-span. One piece of the blade was found embedded in the engine containment ring,¡± Sumwalt said. ¡°Another small piece of the fan blade was recovered from a soccer field in Broomfield, Colorado. Regarding the fan blade that was fractured at the root, a preliminary on scene exam indicates damage consistent with metal fatigue,¡± he added.An up-close shot shows the damage to fan blades in the number 2 engine of United Airlines flight 328, a Boeing 777-200, following an engine failure incident Saturday. (NTSB)Damage was also discovered along the tips and leading edges of the remaining fan blades featured on the PW40777 model engine.The aircraft suffered damage to the area underneath the left wing where the wing joins the body accompanied by a composite fairing underneath the wing that helps improve the aircraft aerodynamic performance. Sumwalt described this as ¡°minor damage,¡± and noted that NTSB discovered other minor dings and nicks along other areas of the wing but at this time his team has not discovered any structural damage.Sumwalt also does not believe at this stage of the investigation that the engine fire which was caught on video could be categorized as an ¡°un-contained engine failure.¡±""We, by our strictest definition do not consider this to be an un-contained engine failure, because the containment ring contained the parts as they were flying out. From a practical point of view to the flying public it really doesn't matter whether or not we technically call it that or not,¡± Sumwalt said.Both the cockpit voice and flight data recorders have been flown to Washington D.C. where NTSB will be reviewing data recovered from each to help gain a better understanding of what caused the engine failure. The piece of the fan blade that was recovered from the Broomfield soccer field is being flown via private jet to Pratt & Whitney for further review at its laboratory in collaboration with NTSB.A 777 operated by Japan Airlines (JAL) on Dec. 4 powered by the same PW4000 engine model also experienced  trouble, although Sumwalt said investigators are not yet sure if the two incidents are related. That incident and the UAL 328 engine failure lead to the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau issuing a suspension of all 777 aircraft powered by that engine type on Feb. 20.This image shows the damage to the wing and the body fairing of the United Airlines flight 328 Boeing 777-200. (NTSB)FAA Administrator Steve Dickson issued a Feb. 21 statement noting his decision to issue an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) that would require ¡°immediate or stepped-up inspection of Boeing 777 airplanes with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines.¡±¡°We reviewed all available data following yesterday¡¯s incident. Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes,¡± Dickson said.Boeing released a statement the same day recommending flight operations for all 69 in-service and the other 59 in-storage 777s powered by the 4000-112 model engines be suspended immediately.¡°Boeing supports the decision yesterday by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, and the FAA¡¯s action today to suspend operations of 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines,¡± Boeing said in the UAL 328 statement. ¡°We are working with these regulators as they take actions while these planes are on the ground and further inspections are conducted by Pratt & Whitney.¡±In a series of tweets, United Airlines explained its decision to remove all 24 of its 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from its schedule.¡°We are voluntarily & temporarily removing 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000 series engines from our schedule,¡± United said. ¡°We will continue to work closely with regulators to determine any additional steps and expect only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.¡±","Boeing 777-200, engines, FAA, NTSB, Pratt & Whitney 4000, UAL 328, United Airlines",Woodrow Bellamy III ,23-Feb-21,

The avionics overhaul program was first publicly announced by Airbus, Honeywell, and UPS during a May 2017 press conference.Replacing the previous analogue A300 technology will give UPS pilots large new high definition displays, a new vertical situation display, the RDR 4000 weather radar system, and a satellite-based augmentation system-capable GPS that can fly LPV and RNP AR approaches, routes and landings.""The prior A300-600 had Honeywell¡¯s Flight Management Computer (FMC),"" Allen Fenske, senior business director at Honeywell Aerospace, told Avionics International. ""It was the limitations of this 30-year-old system that precipitated the original discussions between UPS and Honeywell regarding the upgrade.  The FMC navigation databases are loaded via floppy disks, which takes 45 minutes and due to limited storage space is limited to a regional set of routes.""Fenske, who is responsible for managing avionics supplied to all Airbus aircraft models by Honeywell, said that the key to replacing the use of floppy disks as a storage medium for UPS is their Aircraft Data Gateway (AD300) technology. ""Now these databases are installed wirelessly via the Honeywell Aircraft Data Gateway ADG300 system and completes in two minutes,"" he said. ""Furthermore, the navigation database now includes all the worldwide routes and does not require changing databases based upon the region of operation.""Upgrading software on the A300s has also become easier with Primus Epic, the latest version of which now hosts cockpit functionality such as primary flight display applications or central maintenance computer functions, on multiple processor cards. Whereas each of these separate functions needed to be individually physically modified to upgrade the aircraft's software in the past, each function is now updated through the ADG-300¡¯s wireless interface.The cockpit of the first upgraded A300 to be operated by UPS. (UPS Airlines)A300 operating manuals are also now hosted on the new data gateway, where they can be wirelessly downloaded to the iPads used by UPS pilots. There are also plans to further upgrade the capabilities of the ADG-300 that can be used by UPS, which still needs to clear regulatory approvals, according to Fenske.""The ADG-300, (along with the Honeywell GoDirect Router) enables the ability to ¡°print-to-file¡± flight plans and other documents (in .pdf and .rpt formats).  The information flows from the CMC, thru the ADG-300 to the [electronic flight bag] EFB.  This functionality is not certified yet with UPS, it is planned for mid-2022,"" Fenske said.Primus Epic¡¯s new central maintenance computer gives the A300 a fault history database capable of storing up to 16 flight legs per day and a maximum storage capacity of 6 megabytes. That can accommodate for data generated by more than six months of typical flying with an A300 before its data needs to be offloaded to a ground storage system, according to Fenske.During a Feb. 8 Airbus-UPS Zoom press call, Ed Walton, director of engineering for UPS, told reporters that they're currently in the process of finalizing agreements with two aircraft modification providers tasked with completing the upgrade for the remaining A300s that need it. UPS expects to have the entire A300 fleet upgraded by late next year and Walton believes the avionics refresh could extend the service life through the late 2030s.""We have no concerns at all about the airframes being able to go to 2035 and beyond,"" Walton said.UPS received its first upgraded A300 during a delivery ceremony at the Mobile, Alabama Airbus manufacturing facility. (UPS Airlines)UPS first started taking delivery of the A300s from Airbus between 2000 and 2006. Since then, Walton said, the growth in the number of unique new departure and arrival sequences at airports in the U.S. had become a challenge for the 200-kilobyte storage capacity size of the original flight management computer's navigation database.¡°That worked ok for the first decade,¡± Walton said. ¡°Even though we only fly the airplane in North America, we were pretty much having to be very stingy with the navigation database that we put into the airplane and had to eliminate a lot of airports.""Walton expects upgrades for the remaining A300s to begin in May.","

New Waveform Technology Advances BLOS Connectivity for Helicopters,,"Viasat completed successful demonstrations of a new Ka-band satellite technology that will allow through the blades beyond line of sight (BLOS) communications on a U.S. Army UH-60M rotary-wing helicopter, the company announced Feb. 8. ¡°I think the fundamental aspect of this is today rotary-wing platforms, aren't connected the way fixed-wing platforms are, and what we've seen over the last three to five to even 10 years where we've been able to connect these airborne platforms, they've been able to perform their missions better,¡± Joe Johnson, business area director for rotary broadband services for Viasat Government Services, told Avionics International. ¡°A lot of times, CONOPS are based on what they have available to them today. So if you can get high definition video onto your platform, if you can get true real-time situational awareness onto your platform, how much better can the outcome of your missions be. And that's what we're trying to do.¡± Satellite communications on helicopters are challenging because of their rotary-wing design which interferes with communications every time the blades turn, Johnson said. Viasat developed a waveform that corrects this problem and operates with the same accuracy as without the blade interference. ¡°Helicopter rotor blades go around and for satellite communications, you have to look above because satellites are up in space. So, therefore, your antenna is looking through the rotor blades as they're turning so they break up the signal, every time a blade passes. You need to do something special so that your communications goes through without errors...So, essentially we developed a waveform that corrects for those periodic errors that would be created every time a blade passes through the signal that's going to the satellite.¡± The BLOS Ka-band satellite communications (SATCOM) service allows Army Battle Command Systems to send and receive bandwidth-intensive, full-motion high-definition video, conduct high-quality, real-time video teleconferencing, and exchange information on the WinTak application for precision targeting. The ability to have enhanced communications on these platforms can change how they are used in the field, Johnson said. One example is telemedicine for MEDEVAC where medics on helicopters could be able to communicate in real-time with doctors no on the scene. ¡°Now we have proven we can transform rotary-wing platform communications and enable game-changing connectivity needed to make timely decisions, shorten the kill chain, and reduce fratricide,¡± Ken Peterman, president of government systems at Viasat, said in a press statement. ¡°U.S. Army commanders can now receive and disseminate their intent to subordinate units, on the move, as well as receive timely intelligence with HD video feeds.¡± The demonstrations for this new waveform were done on a UH-60M, however, the technology is not agnostic to a specific platform, Johnson said. The hardware platform used in this demonstration has previously been used on a Marine Corps MV-22 with a different waveform.","Army, BLOS, Ka-band, UH-60M, ViaSat",Kelsey Reichmann,12-Feb-21,

Boeing Advanced Vertical Lift Chief Engineer Talks Next Generation Rotorcraft Capabilities,,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will be focusing on cost, timeline, sustainment, interoperability, and regulatory approvals when developing the requirements for its Next Generation Rotorcraft Capabilities (NGRC). The shift in focus was influenced by collaboration with industry through the NATO Industry Advisory Group (NIAG).The NIAG is a high-level consultative body of senior industrialists from NATO allied and partner nations who advises NATO on key issues within the industrial and technological base.¡°What I think is unique about NIAG is that this is an opportunity for industry to get in the same room and collaborate on the future,¡± Dan Newman, senior technical fellow and chief engineer for Phantom Works Advanced Vertical Lift at Boeing, said during the Royal Aeronautical Society¡¯s Next Generation Rotorcraft Conference on Jan. 20. ¡°At least in the U.S., when the military service does an integration, they talk to each of the industry representatives and then do the integration about what the future ought to be. But they are limited because they are talking to them individually and with proprietary interests at stake there is a challenge sharing any company's information with others.¡±The NGRC will replace an aging fleet of rotorcraft set to retire in the next 10 to 20 years.NIAG started completing study groups on NGRC capabilities in 2017 and has completed three looking at NGR capabilities, integrated sustainability, and innovated military aviation acquisition.The NIAG Study Group SG-219 focused on a concept of operations for equipment for NGRC. This group included 33 companies from 14 different countries. It was out of this group which the NIAG decided to focus on reducing life cycle costs, improving safety, and enhancing capabilities, interoperability, and sustainability, Newman said.¡°We were going to consider the issues common to all platforms because we were looking at replacing the entire fleet of 1,000 aircraft, perhaps up to 2,000, and we couldn't focus on any one mission,¡± Newman said. ¡°So, what did we focus on? We focused on cost and schedule. We focused on operability. We focused on sustainment. And we focused on regulatory approval, and that was important because of the regulatory issues.¡±To achieve those goals, the NIAG suggested the NGR having a modular design with multiple levels of capability so different nations could procure the capabilities they required, Newman said. They also suggested rotorcraft be designed with condition-based operations (CBO) for dynamic planning purposes.¡°So not just a modular aircraft, but a modular design and development a modular acquisition process¡­this modularity allows you to change the avionics and the mission equipment every five years, and not have to wait until a 20-year lifecycle upgrade,¡± Newman said.Newman said they also focused on capabilities being qualified and certified from day one so NATO would have acquisition and operational freedoms.NIAG is suggesting the NATO NGRC move toward unmanned maintenance solutions to increased maintainability, Newman said. Reducing manned solutions can also reduce program costs and risks.¡°We've been moving toward unmanning the maintenance battalion, as opposed to just unmanned in the aircraft,¡± Newman said. ¡°So, this unmanned needs to be extended expanded beyond takeoff through landing that needs to be include landing through takeoff.¡±Newman said NATO is also working on putting out requirements for NGRC that will include capabilities like speed, range, payload, and endurance while also taking into account the capabilities the NIAG is suggesting as well.¡°The goal was to move from speeches and briefings like this one to requirements documents because if it doesn't get into the requirements document, it will not be part of the system,¡± Newman said. ¡®Again, if it doesn't get into the requirements, no one will offer it. And so, speeches and articles are good, but the requirements are the pull and the draw.¡±","NATO, NGRC, NIAG, Rotorcraft",Kelsey Reichmann,21-Jan-21,
Agility Prime to Study the Use of Radar Developed for Cars in eVTOLs,,"The U.S. Air Force awarded a contract to study a radar sensing solution, the SPEKTRA radar, used by the automotive industry to see if it can be modified for electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) operations in its Agility Prime program, the manufacturer of the radar, Metawave Corporation, announced in a Jan. 6 press release.Agility Prime is the U.S. Air Force's effort, along with numerous other federal agencies, to support booming commercial investment into eVTOLs. The SPEKTRA radar provides radar capabilities with accuracy out to 330 meters and is used in adaptive cruise control, lane change assist, and automated emergency braking in automobiles, according to the release.The SPEKTRA radar was developed by Metawave with the help of Rhea Space Activity (RSA) who suggested the radar as a good fit for the Agility Prime program while it was in the process of becoming commercially operational, according to the release.""Rapid technological innovation in the U.S. driverless car sector is also demonstrating remarkable compatibility with the high-performance requirements of many Department of Defense missions,"" Shawn Usman, astrophysicist and Founder of RSA said in a press statement. ""SPEKTRA in particular is versatile enough to support unmanned VTOL operations as well as fixed-wing flight.

"U.S., Europe Civil Aircraft Parts Tariff Battle Escalates",,"New tariffs on European Union (EU) aircraft manufacturing parts from the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) that were announced last month are set to become effective on Jan. 12. The tariffs are just the latest escalation in the tit-for-tat tariff battle between U.S. and European regulatory officials over large civil aircraft subsidies involving aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing.The new tariffs from the U.S. are in response to November tariffs from the EU and will affect EU fuselages and fuselage sections, wings and wing assemblies, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers. Airbus condemned the new tariffs.¡°USTR¡¯s expansion of tariffs to include components for aircraft manufactured in the U.S. ¨C by American workers ¨C is counterproductive in every way,¡± a representative for Airbus said in an emailed statement to Avionics International. ¡°Airbus regrets that USTR has decided to escalate this dispute by taking a step that also hurts U.S. manufacturing, U.S. workers, and U.S. consumers. This will not contribute to a climate of trust to create a negotiated solution.¡±The dispute began in 2019 as a result of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Large Civil Aircraft litigation which involved EU subsides equaling $7.5 billion annually, according to the USTR. The U.S. determined they were denied rights under the WTO Agreement and placed additional duties on products from certain EU member states in Oct. 2019.The initial tariffs were then increased again by the U.S. in March and June 2020. The EU responded in Nov. 2020 imposing additional duties on U.S. large civil aircraft and other goods equaling a trade value of $4 billion.On Dec. 30, USTR published its response to the action taken by the EU in November, levying additional tariffs to aircraft parts manufactured in France and Germany.¡°The EU has represented that its retaliatory action mirrors the action taken by the United States in this investigation, but that is not accurate,¡± the notice from the USTR said. ¡°Specifically, the EU¡¯s action does not mirror the U.S. action because the methodology used by the EU to exercise its $4 billion authorization relies on a benchmark reference period affected by the economic downturn caused by the COVID pandemic. Under this methodology, the EU was able to cover a greater volume of imports than if, like the United States, it had used data from a period when trade was not affected by the pandemic.¡±The USTR said their actions were not escalatory because the adjusted product coverage was less than the full amount of what would have been justified using the EU¡¯s chosen time period.However, Airbus disagreed and said in their statement that the new tariffs were unwarranted.¡°Airbus trusts that Europe will respond appropriately to defend its interests and the interests of all European companies and sectors, including Airbus, targeted by these unwarranted and counterproductive tariffs,¡± Airbus said in an emailed statement.","Airbus, Boeing, European Union, Large Civil Aircraft legislation, tariffs, WTO",Kelsey Reichmann," January 5, 2021",
Fifth Generation Flight Test Demonstrates Military IoT with XQ-58A and gatewayONE Platform,,"The Air Force completed a flight test that demonstrated the ability of two fifth-generation aircraft and an unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) to communicate in their secure native languages without the need for legacy tactical data connections, according to a Dec. 9 U.S. Air Force press release.

US Air Force proves it can transport a ¡®flying car¡¯ on a C-130. Now for the fun part.,,"U.S. airmen from the 79th Rescue Squadron and the 571st Mobility Support Advisory Squadron push a Lift Aircraft eVTOL platform onto a C-130J Super Hercules from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., at the Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport in Ohio on March 23, 2021. (Wesley Farnsworth/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force will begin testing in May whether it can use one of the ¡°flying cars¡± under development for the commercial market for military missions, including rescuing troops, delivering cargo and conducting security checks over an airfield.But first the service had to answer a simpler question: Could one of these electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) aircraft fit into a military cargo plane and safely be transported?The Air Force attempted to prove that during a demonstration held March 23-24, when the 355th Wing from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona successfully used an HC-130J Combat King II to move Lift Aircraft¡¯s Hexa platform from Springfield-Beckley Municipal Airport in Ohio to Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas.The demo was part of the service¡¯s Agility Prime effort, through which the Air Force hopes to accelerate the development of eVTOL technologies and ensure the U.S. military retains access to them.¡°We¡¯re trying to take acquisition and do it differently,¡± said James Bieryla, the division chief responsible for Agility Prime at the service¡¯s AFWERX innovation cell.¡°Instead of putting a very rigid set of requirements on a company, we¡¯re almost doing the opposite. We¡¯re saying: ¡®You know what, why don¡¯t you show us what you can do?¡¯ We say that to perhaps a dozen companies. ¡­ We help usher them through and accelerate them,¡± he said. ¡°And on the back end, hopefully what happens is we end up with 12 or more commercially viable, successful companies, many of whom will have military utility in lots of different areas.¡±The Air Force kicked off Agility Prime in February 2020 and since then has identified six companies as potential partners, according to Air Force Magazine: Phenix Solutions, Joby Aviation, Elroy Air, Moog, Beta Technologies and Lift Aircraft. In December, Joby¡¯s S4 aircraft was the first eVTOL design to receive airworthiness approval from the service.The end goal is to transition eVTOL technologies into a program of record by 2023, Bieryla said.¡°That is a very aggressive goal,¡± he noted. ¡°This demonstration here in May is going to be great for us to actually get a firsthand look right from operators into the technology.¡±Handling HexaLast week¡¯s demonstration was accomplished with little fanfare and no significant challenges, officials from the Air Force and Lift Aircraft told Defense News on March 26.Matt Chasen, Lift Aircraft CEO, pilots the eVTOL Hexa over Camp Mabry, Texas, on Aug. 20, 2020. (Staff. Sgt. Sean Kornegay/Air National Guard)Matt Chasen, Lift Aircraft CEO, pilots the eVTOL Hexa over Camp Mabry, Texas, on Aug. 20, 2020. (Staff. Sgt. Sean Kornegay/Air National Guard)The Hexa aircraft is comprised of an egg-shaped fuselage positioned on four perimeter floats, which allow it to land on water. On top sits a web of 18 electric motors arranged in a hexagonal pattern similar to that of honeycomb.To package Hexa for transit, Lift Aircraft separated the motors and some additional hardware, and folded down the beams that connect the motors to the aircraft¡¯s fuselage, said Jace McCown, the firm¡¯s flight development engineer and chief pilot.Once the Hexa was compressed and safely stored with all of its support equipment, Air Force personnel tested out how to load it onto the C-130, eventually choosing to use the aircraft¡¯s ramp system to push it into the cargo bay, said Tech Sgt. Joseph Wruck, who helped support the load tests as part of the 571st Mobility Support Advisory Squadron.The process of loading the Hexa and support equipment took about 45 minutes, but that timeline could probably be condensed into 15 minutes, Wruck said. And while only one Hexa aircraft was transported during the demonstration, Wruck estimated that a C-130H could carry up to four Hexa platforms, with newer C-130J models potentially able to transport five or six at a time.Finally, the HC-130J took off, flying the Hexa stored inside its cargo bay from Ohio to Texas.Rescuing RandyIn May, the Air Force will repeat the process as part of Exercise Bushwhacker, when the 355th Wing simulates rescue and attack missions in austere environments.VTOL platforms with quiet electric engines and simple sustainment footprints could become key to the Air Force as it figures out how to operate away from large airfields, a concept known as agile combat employment, or ACE.Should the U.S. go to war against Russia or China, the service predicts its main operating bases in Europe or the Asia-Pacific region could be temporarily or permanently knocked out by enemy fire. In response, the Air Force hopes to shift to a more disaggregated style of fighting, where discrete packages of aircraft are temporarily deployed to smaller airfields across the globe that may not have large runways or established amenities.Electric VTOL aircraft capable of landing without a runway could be used to ferry troops and supplies needed to stand up operations, while also providing a platform for crisis response.During Exercise Bushwhacker, airmen will practice transporting, unloading and reassembling the Hexa ¡ª a process that should take about two to three hours, according to McCown.Airmen load a trailer with pieces of a Lift Aircraft eVTOL aircraft at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, Texas, on March 24, 2021. airmen from the 355th Wing are evaluating how eVTOL capabilities may be integrated into Davis-Monthan Air Force Base¡¯s rescue and attack missions.

(Senior Airman Jacob T. Stephens/U.S. Air Force)From there, Hexa will be put through its paces in a number of scenarios, such as delivering supplies or rescuing a stranded troop on the ground, said Maj. Brennan Gallagher, 563rd Rescue Group¡¯s chief of weapons and tactics and the lead planner for 355th Wing¡¯s Agility Prime integration.¡°If someone has a single engine failure outside the wire and then needs to get picked up, instead of risking a convoy going out, we could send one of these Lift Hexas out there,¡± he said. ¡°Hexa would fly to those coordinates, land, pick up someone. In this case, we¡¯re looking to use a crash dummy, which we call Rescue Randy.¡±Right now, Hexa¡¯s abilities are limited and geared toward the commercial recreation market. The aircraft has room for one person and can fly for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the payload. A person can learn to fly Hexa quickly because many of the flight systems are automated, but Lift plans to develop a fully automated version, McCown said.In the future, the platform could potentially serve as an armed overwatch aircraft to protect ground troops, Gallagher said.However, there are still missions that the aircraft could be suited for in its current configuration. For instance, while Hexa can¡¯t carry as much weight as required to satisfy certain logistics missions, it could transfer smaller cargo or serve as a vehicle that allows security forces to assess the status of an airfield, said Lt. Col. Shane Hughes, commander of the 621st Contingency Response Support Squadron.¡°It can zip around the airfield really quick with our security forces specialists; they can do a quick assessment and then that saves them a significant amount of time,¡± he said.McCown added that Lift is open to incorporating military users¡¯ feedback into future iterations of the aircraft.¡°There¡¯s a lot of potential with this airframe, and we¡¯re currently working through AFWERX to kind of explore the next level of what is possible with this,¡± he said. ¡°We¡¯re currently executing flight tests out in Ohio under a [Small Business Innovation Research Phase II contract], and we are exploring the next steps with the Air Force right now as far as what kind of support [is needed] to get us to reach some of those longer-term goals that the operators have.¡±By being involved in the development of eVTOL platforms at an early stage, the Air Force hopes to steer the evolution of the technology into a form that it can use.¡°We certainly understand that this is not the final configuration right now,¡± Bieryla said. ¡°We¡¯re working forward. We¡¯re going to keep developing, we¡¯re going to keep coming up with improvements. But ¡­ if we can get early operator involvement in this technology, it helps everybody.¡±",,Valerie Insinna ,2021/3/31,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/03/31/us-air-force-proves-it-can-transport-a-flying-car-on-a-c-130-now-for-the-fun-part/
Lebanon¡¯s Air Force launches public aircraft bids as part of fleet reorg,,"An American-made Sikorsky S-61N helicopter comes in for landing upon delivery to Lebanon on June 2, 2009. The helos were bought for firefighting purposes. (Joseph Barrak/AFP via Getty Images)BEIRUT ¡ª Lebanon is selling five Hawker Hunter fighter jets and three Sikorsky-made S-61 helicopters, the Ministry of National Defense announced, calling for interested parties to bid on the used aircraft.A source with knowledge of the sales process told Defense News on condition of anonymity that three companies have shown interest in the Hawker Hunter jets in particular: British firm Hawker Hunter Aviation as well as U.S.-based companies Airborne Tactical Advantage Company (a subsidiary of Textron Systems) and Lortie Aviation.The Lebanese Air Force¡¯s Hawker Hunters have been nonoperational since 2010. The country is keeping two of them to be preserved in a local museum.Companies tend to purchase old aircraft to refurbish them for use as enemy fighters in training.The commander of the Air Force, Brig. Gen. Ziad Haikal, told Defense News that the sale is part of the service¡¯s effort to reallocate its assets and restructure its fleets to maximize the utility of available resources.¡°The Hawker Hunter aircraft and Sikorsky helicopters have been nonoperational for many years, in the absence of financial resources to maintain them. This public auction will be the first step to restructure the training fleet and fire-fighting capabilities,¡± he said.He added that the Air Force has developed a future five-year plan aimed at ensuring the maintenance of equipment, preserving existing capabilities and gradually enhancing its inventory.¡°The reinforcement plan depends on doubling the number of light attack A-29 Super Tucano aircraft from six to 12, and [acquiring] MD530F helicopters ¡ª six of which are expected to be received by the end of 2021 ¡ª in addition to Scan Eagle drones, in such a way that each squadron includes at least 12 aircraft or helicopters of the same type,¡± Haikal said.Lebanon operates six A-29 Super Tucano planes that were delivered to the Air Force as a part of a U.S. military aid program. The Lebanese Air Force receives about 30-40 percent of the $50-60 million in annual aid.Regarding the five-year plan, Haikal said he wants to have ¡°the air capabilities that allow [for] protecting the Lebanese airspace from any aggression or violations, [which] remains one of the strategic objectives of the Army and the Air Force. Achieving this objective requires, securing the infrastructure for the available airports, securing a suitable radar and air defense network, in addition to achieving modern air interception aircraft.¡±Lebanon lacks the three primary pillars to effectively secure its airspace; a radar network, missile defense systems and fighter jets are a future aspiration, but the economic crisis pervading the country has served as a roadblock.The Air Force chief said the existing fleet of UH-1H Huey II helicopters will be used to put out fires instead of the Sikorsky helos.¡°An alternative to the Hunters, for close-air support missions, are the Super Tucano aircraft, [which] outperform the Hunter jet by being equipped with advanced weapon systems and laser-guided weapons. As for the classification of the Hunter as a jet plane, there is no current alternative for this class in the Air Force,¡± he said.He added that the service is eyeing a contract with American firm Air Tractor for an aircraft similar to the AT-802 that can support the county¡¯s firefighting capabilities as well as for spare parts and pilot and technician training. The money made from selling the S-61 helos would go toward that purchase, he explained. He also said the Air Force will seek initial entry training aircraft after selling the Hawker Hunters.A decree issued by the Council of Ministers of Lebanon states that the returns are to be allocated for the Air Force to procure new aircraft. Such a statement can¡¯t be annulled except by another government decree.The Lebanese Air Force previously showed interest in the Pakistani Super Mushshak trainers, but it never received a response from Pakistani authorities. Haikal said the Air Force might now buy additional Cessna or Cirrus trainers.Asked if U.S. military aid to Lebanon might help the Lebanese Air Force restructure its fleet, Haikal said: ¡°The U.S. aid program depends mainly on plans by the Lebanese Army Command. All these plans are updated and regularized annually or when needed. So far, no American aid has been allocated to complete the set plan after implementing the bidding process. It is possible, if necessary, [that the aid could] support the plan in the future.¡±",,Agnes Helou ,2021/3/29,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/03/29/want-to-buy-fighter-jets-and-helos-lebanon-is-accepting-bids/
A new bill would defund new ICBMs to pay for coronavirus vaccine research,,"An Air Force Global Strike Command unarmed Minuteman III ICBM launches during an operation test on Feb. 23, 2021, at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. (Brittany E. N. Murphy/U.S. Space Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Two lawmakers want to stop development of new intercontinental ballistic missiles and use the associated funding for coronavirus prevention, introducing legislation on March 26 that would curtail the Air Force¡¯s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program.The Investing in Cures Before Missiles Act, offered by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., could signify a second attempt by progressive lawmakers to use the GBSD program as a billpayer to fund pandemic relief and preparedness efforts.If enacted, the ICBM Act would prohibit the U.S. government for using fiscal 2022 spending on the GBSD program and the National Nuclear Security Administration¡¯s W87-1 warhead modification program.Instead, $1 billion of unobligated funds from the GBSD program would be transferred to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for research on a universal coronavirus vaccine that would protect against future pandemics. Unobligated funds from the W87-1 modification program would go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for infectious disease research.The bill would also commission an independent study by the National Academy of Sciences to explore how to extend the life of the Minuteman III missiles until 2050.¡°The United States should invest in a vaccine of mass prevention before another new land-based weapon of mass destruction,¡± Markey said. ¡°The ICBM Act makes clear that we can begin to phase out the Cold War nuclear posture that risks accidental nuclear war while still deterring adversaries and assuring allies, and redirect those savings to the clear and present dangers presented by coronaviruses and other emerging and infectious diseases.¡±GBSD is currently under development by Northrop Grumman, which won a $13.3 billion award in September to build a replacement for the LGM-30G Minuteman III. Acquisition costs are projected to amount to anywhere from about $93 billion to $96 billion.In a statement, Khanna argued that extending the life of the Minuteman III is more fiscally responsible than moving forward with a new ICBM program. ¡°With all of the global challenges we face, the last thing we should be doing is giving billions to defense contractors to build missiles we don¡¯t need to keep as a strong nuclear deterrence,¡± Khanna said.However, U.S. Strategic Command and Air Force officials have repeatedly stated that the GBSD program is the only cost-effective way forward for modernizing the intercontinental ballistic missile leg of the nuclear triad.¡°You cannot life-extend Minuteman III,¡± STRATCOM head Adm. Charles Richard said in January. ¡°It is getting past the point of [where] it¡¯s not cost-effective to life-extend Minuteman III. You¡¯re quickly getting to the point [where] you can¡¯t do it at all.¡±The proposed legislation has amassed some early support in the House and Senate. Co-sponsors include Sens. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; as well as Reps. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore.; Steve Cohen, D-Tenn.; Jesus Garcia, D-Ill.; Raul M.

The measure was backed by committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., but he was unable to secure enough support from Democrats for it to pass through committee, failing in a 44-12 vote last July.Earlier this month, Markey and Khanna sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging the White House to roll back the development and deployment of two Trump-era nuclear weapons: the low-yield submarine-launched W76-2 warhead, which was first demonstrated in 2019, and the sea-launched cruise missile proposed as part of the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review.",,Valerie Insinna ,2021/3/26,https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nuclear-arsenal/2021/03/26/a-new-bill-would-defund-new-icbms-to-pay-for-coronavirus-vaccine-research/

Czech Air Force orders missile warning systems for its Mi-17 helos,,"The Czech Republic has ordered the Missile Approach Confirmation Sensor. (Courtesy of Bird Aerosystems)JERUSALEM ¡ª Israel¡¯s Bird Aerosystems will provide the Czech Air Force with missile warning technology for its Mi-17 helicopters, the company announced March 22.The deal for Missile Approach Confirmation Sensors, or MACS, is not the first time Bird Aerosystems has equipped Mi-17 helos. It previously supplied airborne missile protection systems to the United Nations¡¯ Mi-17 fleet operating in Africa.¡°We appreciate the confidence placed in our AMPS solution by the Czech Air Force, who decided to purchase additional systems for its Mi-17 fleet,¡± said Ronen Factor, co-chief executive officer and founder at Bird Aerosystems.Under the contract, of which the value was not disclosed, Bird Aerosystems will provide additional AMPS missile verification systems with the MACS. The contract builds on a different deal announced in September 2020 for the company to upgrade the AMPS previously provided to the Czech Air Force and prepare it for future installation of the MACS.The MACS is a semi-active confirmation radar that reduces the false alarm rate of the overall missile warning system. ¡°Queued by a suspected threat, MACS points towards it and performs a Doppler-based interrogation to confirm the existence of a valid threat,¡± the company said. ¡°Doing so, MACS provides the most effective filtering of all known natural and human-made types of false alarms typically detected by electro-optical sensors, and ensures that only real missiles will be declared by the system and reacted upon.¡±Bird Aerosystems says its AMPS provides protection for military and civilian aircraft against surface-to-air missiles, including those from man-portable air-defense systems; laser beam rider threats; and radar-guided missiles. ¡°The AMPS system automatically detects, verifies, and foil missile attacks through the effective use of countermeasure decoys (Flares and Chaff) that jam the missile¡¯s IR seeker and protect the aircraft,¡± the company said in a statement.The latest deal is part of the Czech Republic¡¯s transport helicopter modernization effort. Local reports last year said that Bird Aerosystems won a contract to upgrade AMPS for seven helicopters, which the company said it completed earlier this year.

"F-35 program moves too slowly in deploying software, says government watchdog",,"The F-35 program's plan to get new software packages fielded every six months isn't working as designed. (Master Sgt. Patrick OReilly/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The F-35 program aims to use agile software development practices to ensure the Joint Strike Fighter can quickly receive fresh code to meet emerging threats, but production of new software is still lagging behind schedule, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a March 18 report.In 2018, the F-35 Joint Program Office announced a plan to begin releasing small increments of software code every six months ¡ª a model it called Continuous Capability Development and Delivery.Under C2D2, each software drop should be comprised of four increments of code. This is meant to allow F-35 prime contractor Lockheed Martin to develop software during the first phase, and then test it for defects, fix them and test again before pushing the software it to operational jets.However, the recent software releases have been comprised of more than four increments to allow the company to tackle bugs that were repeatedly discovered during the coding process, the GAO found.¡°For example, software delivered in June 2020 included 10 increments ¡ª six more than originally planned,¡± the GAO stated in its report. ¡°Lockheed Martin representatives said that two of these increments were added to increase functionality and mature capabilities to avoid delays in the next software drop. However, according to contractor representatives, four of the added increments were to address software defects.¡±Another software drop, which was originally scheduled for October 2020, included eight increments in total, with four modules added to address bugs, Lockheed representatives told the GAO. That release has been delayed until April 2021.There are several reasons why software releases are falling behind schedule. For one, Lockheed does not always develop code for all required capabilities during the first increment, as originally planned. The company said this is because of ¡°late contract awards preventing them from conducting new work, supply chain issues, and recent workforce capacity issues stemming from COVID-19 restrictions,¡± the report stated.Lockheed also had trouble identifying software deficiencies before new code was released to operational F-35s, with one analysis by a third party finding that 23 percent of all defects (656 bugs total) were discovered after delivery from December 2017 to September 2020.The program risks further disruption to its schedule as the F-35 moves through the Block 4 modernization effort, which began in 2018 to add new hardware and software to the aircraft. According to a review by the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, future software drops planned for 2023 through 2025 ¡°are more complex¡± than current releases, while the overall schedule is ¡°high risk,¡± the report stated.¡°Program officials stated that the program is currently reviewing the feasibility of its schedule and DOT&E officials told us that the program office is considering establishing longer time frames for each software drop, such as extending them to 1 year. Simply adding time to the development cycle, however, may not fully address the program¡¯s challenges,¡± the GAO said, using an acronym for the office of the director of operational test and evaluation.¡°Without a software development schedule that reflects how much work can be accomplished in each increment based on historical performance, the program office will continue to experience Block 4 development delays, and capabilities will continue to be postponed into later software drops,¡± the watchdog added.In the end, those delays could lead to cost increases and capabilities becoming outdated before they ever reach the flight line.The GAO ultimately recommended that the F-35 program office implement tools to automate the collection of data related to the software development process, making it easier for the program to identify whether Lockheed is meeting performance targets.Lt. Gen. Eric Fick, who leads the government¡¯s F-35 Joint Program Office, said that the Pentagon concurs with the GAO¡¯s recommendations and is working to improve the aircraft¡¯s software factory.¡°The ability to stay ahead of our adversaries in the high-end fight is inextricably linked to our ability to deliver high-quality software to the F-35 air system at speed. Today, software quality is missing the mark which is driving increased cost and delays,¡± he said in a statement.Lockheed has also taken steps to review F-35 software development, launching an independent review team in fall 2020 to lead a programwide assessment of the aircraft¡¯s software capabilities. ¡°This team, comprised of representatives from the JPO, Lockheed Martin, U.S. Government and industry, has made significant progress in identifying and addressing opportunities that provide quality products on time and on budget for the F-35 customer,¡± the company stated.The GAO¡¯s report echoed earlier concerns by the Pentagon¡¯s independent weapons tester, who in 2020 questioned whether the program office would be able to put out new software releases on schedule.¡°The current Continuous Capability Development and Delivery (C2D2) process has not been able to keep pace with adding new increments of capability as planned,¡± Robert Behler, the Pentagon¡¯s director of operational test and evaluation, wrote then. ¡°Software changes, intended to introduce new capabilities or fix deficiencies, often introduced stability problems and adversely affected other functionality.¡±Simulation difficultiesAs the F-35 grapples with software development challenges, it is also facing continued difficulties integrating the F-35 with the Joint Simulation Environment, or JSE ¡ª a key simulation technology that allows F-35 pilots to face off against complex and highly advanced threats that would be impossible to replicate in live training events.The F-35 must complete 64 scenarios in the JSE in order to wrap up operational testing and move forward to a full-rate production decision.

(Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images)WASHINGTON ¡ª A new defense spending plan from the British Ministry of Defence contains mixed news for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, as London pivots its gaze to its future homegrown fighter design.The document, released Monday, stated that the U.K. plans to ¡°grow the [F-35] Force, increasing the fleet size beyond the 48 aircraft that we have already ordered.¡± However, the document said nothing about previously announced plans to buy 138 of the F-35B models.On one hand, that¡¯s a positive sign for the fighter jet¡¯s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin: The pledge to procure more jets comes in the wake of discussions about whether the program could be capped at 48. On the other, it is far from Britain¡¯s original pledge to buy 138 of the short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing combat jets to equip the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The F-35Bs are principally scheduled to equip two new, 65,000-ton aircraft carriers.Who are the winners and losers in Britain¡¯s new defense review?Who are the winners and losers in Britain¡¯s new defense review?A new defense, security and foreign policy review calls for cuts to the British Army¡¯s end strength and aging hardware as well as the creation of new military structures and the acquisition of high-tech capabilities.By: Andrew ChuterTalking to Washington-based reporters on Monday, James Heappey, armed forces minister, did nothing to firm up the projected buy when asked directly about the 138 figure.¡°We¡¯ve committed to 48, we¡¯ll buy 48,¡± Heappey said. ¡°We¡¯ve invested heavily in our own Future Combat Air System, which we¡¯re developing with a number of other partner nations. I think that there¡¯s a discussion on going over what the exact shape of the fast Air Force looks like in the future. But the 48 that were signed up for, the check¡¯s in the post.¡±While Air Marshal Richard Knighton, the deputy chief of the Defense Staff for capability, said in December that Britain knows it must ¡°increase the number of F-35Bs to support the [Royal Navy] carrier through to its out-of-service date,¡± he expected to see ¡°a definitive judgement around the total future fleet in the 2025 time frame.¡±Justin Bronk, an air warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute in England, said the government¡¯s ¡°stated position, without details on future order plans, is probably politically unsustainable unless concrete assurances have been made to, and believed by, U.S. counterparts in private,¡± particularly for the U.S. Marine Corps, which is the other major user of the F-35B model.¡°The U.K.¡¯s operational requirements across the whole joint force for credible [suppression of enemy air defenses], penetrating [intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance], and strike capabilities cannot be met with 48 aircraft, especially given the latter will be heavily committed to supporting global carrier deployments,¡± Bronk added. ¡°However, the lack of detail suggests funding for future orders has not yet been identified, as the government has decided to put national industrial sustainment ¡ª Tempest ¡ª ahead of operational needs in the combat air arena for the foreseeable future.¡±The idea that the F-35 may see a cut due to the Future Combat Air System program, dubbed Tempest, is not a surprise. When the model for Tempest was unveiled at the 2018 Farnborough Airshow, one of the biggest questions was how the government could afford it while also maintaining its F-35 buy.Awash in technology hook-ups, Team Tempest longs for steady partnersAwash in technology hook-ups, Team Tempest longs for steady partners¡°The U.K. is keen to see more international partners join us,"" says Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. ""There is room for a broad range of other partnerships.¡±By: Andrew ChuterAccording to the review, Britain has allocated ?2 billion in development funding for Tempest over the next four years ¡ª a notable sum at a time the French-German-Spanish alliance to build a competing European fighter seems to be wobbling.But the latest review emphasized Tempest not only as a future fighting capability but as a vital part of the defense-industrial base, saying the program ¡°has already created over 1,800 new STEM jobs in over 300 companies nationwide, sustaining and supporting over 18,000 existing highly skilled jobs in the sector, as well as tens of thousands more in the wider supply chains across the UK.¡±The report specifically called out Tempest as providing employment opportunities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.For a decade, it¡¯s appeared unrealistic that Britain could afford 138 F-35 jets, according to Bronk. ¡°But the level of ambition and emphasis being signaled on Tempest probably means that the highest plausible U.K. purchase is now somewhere in the region of 60-72 jets,¡± he said.Still, the F-35 remains fundamental for Britain¡¯s plans, even if the 138 figure appears further away than anticipated. Heappey noted that the use of the plane among the American, Italian and Australian navies, among others, gives a common operating picture with which to work.¡°There is going to be a community of F-35 nations that we would be mad to ignore,¡± he said.",,Aaron Mehta ,2021/3/22,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/03/23/new-british-plan-looks-to-boost-f-35-numbers-but-is-it-still-aiming-for-138/
"Taiwan to deploy upgraded F-16 jets, says air chief",,"Taiwan currently has 66 new F-16Vs on order with the United States.

US Air Force¡¯s T-38 trainer could soon dogfight with augmented reality adversaries,,"A Red Six pilot flies the Berkut 540 while using the Airborne Tactical Augmented Reality System, which shows simulated imagery of adversaries during live flights. (Red 6)WASHINGTON ¡ª In the future, when U.S. Air Force fighter pilots face off in aerial combat training missions, they could be dogfighting the video game version of Chinese and Russian warplanes at a fraction of the cost of using real jets like the F-22 Raptor.At least that¡¯s the pitch the California-based company known as Red 6 is making to the service.For the past three years, Red 6 has been working with the Air Force to mature its Airborne Tactical Augmented Reality System, or ATARS, which allows pilots flying real fighters to see projections of other aircraft through their helmet visor.Now the company is on the brink of finalizing a Small Business Innovation Research Phase III contract with the Air Force that will allow it to integrate its technology with a Northrop T-38 Talon ¡ª the supersonic jet trainer used to train fighter pilots, according to its founder and CEO, Dan Robinson.¡°We¡¯re working in partnership with the test community at Holloman Air Force Base to do that, and then we¡¯re going to be working hand in hand with them to evolve that and make sure that it¡¯s ruggedized,¡± he told Defense News in a March 17 interview.The company is also using internal funding to network multiple ATARS together so that more than one aircraft can train as a group against a larger set of adversaries. The hope is to demonstrate that capability for the Navy and Air Force sometime this year, Robinson said.Unlike virtual reality, where everything the user sees through a headset is simulated, augmented reality superimposes simulated images over the real world.The ATARS system comprises a custom augmented reality headset designed to be worn with a standard HGU-55 helmet used by F-15 and F-16 pilots. It also includes hardware and software responsible for tracking the pilot¡¯s head in space and displaying information, all driven by a game engine.¡°It¡¯s minimally intrusive. It¡¯s designed to be platform agnostic,¡± Robinson said. ¡°It will incorporate into any aircraft, and there will be slight adjustments to determine antenna positioning and things like that.¡±If Red 6 proves that its technology works, it could solve one of the Air Force¡¯s longstanding requirements: the need for cost-effective ¡°red air¡± training that gives fighter pilots experience in close-quarters aerial combat.In 2019, the Air Force awarded a contract to seven companies that provide red air training services: Air USA, Airborne Tactical Advantage Company, Blue Air Training, Coastal Defense, Draken International, Tactical Air Support and Top Aces.These companies typically buy up used third-generation subsonic fighters and hire retired military pilots to pose as aggressors in training missions. However, to train against more advanced threats, the Air Force has to use its own aircraft as aggressors.Currently, there is no way for the Air Force to virtually represent an adversary once a threat gets within visual range, or about 10 nautical miles.Using tools like threat emitters that replicate the radiofrequencies emitted by missiles, artillery and other aircraft is sufficient to train pilots beyond visual ranges, Robinson said earlier this week at an event held by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. But with augmented reality, the Air Force would be able to virtually project ¡ª for example ¡ª a combat-representative Russian Su-57 that the pilot must dogfight.¡°So far, augmented reality hasn¡¯t worked outdoors or in dynamic environments,¡± Robinson said. ¡°It does now.¡±The path forwardAlthough there is no current program of record for the solution Red 6 could provide to the military, the company has some notable former Air Force leaders on its side.In February, Red 6 appointed Mike Holmes, the former four-star general who led Air Combat Command, as chairman of its board. The company added former acquisition executive Will Roper to its advisory board earlier this month.Red 6 has received buy-in from sources such as the Air Force¡¯s AFWERX innovation hub ¡ª having been awarded Small Business Innovation Research Phase I and II contracts ¡ª and received an investment of undisclosed value from Lockheed Martin¡¯s venture capital arm in June 2020.During the SBIRS Phase III contract, Robinson plans to work with the Air Force on solidifying a business model for providing the technology as well as finalizing the cost. But to get that money, lawmakers will need proof that the technology works, said Robert ¡°Otis¡± Winkler, a professional staff member for the Senate Armed Services Committee.¡°Moving it into a training environment where you¡¯re actually projecting images that aren¡¯t necessarily there is something that we¡¯re going to have to prove to folks as far as latency, as far as the ability to make a difference in training,¡± he said during the Mitchell Institute event.However, advancements like the F-35 helmet-mounted display ¡ª which overlays imagery from the jet¡¯s sensors into a singular picture projected onto the helmet ¡ª supports the idea that pilots can wear highly sophisticated optical systems while conducting normal flight operations.¡°I think when people actually experience this, it becomes hard to argue,¡± he said. ¡°I mean, if you look at what are our kids are doing when it comes to augmented reality, in the video games that they are playing, that¡¯s kind of the expectation when folks show up in the military. And I think most of them are disappointed.¡±As the company figures out how to link multiple ATARS systems together across large distances, it will need to overcome the challenge of latency, Robinson said.A solution to that problem is something that companies like Red 6 might be able to learn from large, global, multiplayer games such as Fortnite, which uses techniques such as pose estimation and predictive analysis to ensure all users are sharing the same experience, said Robinson.¡°On multiplayer games ¡­ the movements are much more nuanced and rapid ¡ª so for example, a soldier crouching behind a desk,¡± he said. ¡°What we¡¯re talking about is fighter combat, where ... the realities of the physical limitations of the airplane are a little more predictive.¡±",,Valerie Insinna ,2021/3/19,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/03/19/the-air-forces-t-38-trainer-could-dogfight-with-augmented-reality-adversaries-soon/
Estimated development costs for the F-35¡äs modernization program increased by $1.9B in a year,,"An F-35 from the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, lands at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England, on April 19, 2017. (Staff Sgt. Emerson Nu?ez/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The estimated development costs for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter¡¯s ongoing modernization program grew by $1.9 billion since 2019, and the effort is expected to extend though 2027, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a new March 18 report.Over the course of the F-35¡äs Block 4 modernization program, which officially began in 2018, the Pentagon will upgrade the Lockheed Martin-produced jet¡¯s hardware and software, adding new weapons capabilities and computing systems.But due to challenges in developing and testing some of those new technologies, as well as continued schedule delays, the U.S. Defense Department¡¯s most recent estimate in 2020 shows that Block 4 development is now projected to reach $14.4 billion, the GAO said.Meanwhile, the modernization effort ¡ª which was initially expected to wrap up in 2026 ¡ª is now scheduled to conclude one year later, though the GAO noted that the schedule is based on ¡°estimates formulated at the start of the Block 4 effort¡± and not Lockheed¡¯s demonstrated performance. Therefore, it is possible ¡°the scheduled 2027 completion date is not achievable,¡± the watchdog stated.The GAO listed a number of reasons for the $1.9 billion in cost growth. A cost increase for flight tests resulted in an additional $705 million charge; overhead and administrative costs ballooned by $471 million; and the cost of a new training lab added $336 million. A package of computing system upgrades, known as Technology Refresh 3, experienced a $296 million cost increase.The news of the cost increases comes weeks after Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown acknowledged the service is conducting a tactical aircraft study to explore whether it should buy fewer F-35s. Currently, the U.S. Air Force is the F-35¡äs largest customer, with 1,763 F-35As included in the service¡¯s program of record.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., indicated his own frustration with F-35 program costs during a March 5 event where he said the nation should ¡°stop throwing money down that particular rathole.¡±In a statement, F-35 program executive Lt. Gen. Eric Fick said the government continues to make progress on Block 4. ¡°Program risks still exist, but are well understood and actively managed,¡± he said.The Pentagon previously issued a seven-year cost estimate for the Block 4 effort, claiming in 2018 that the program would cost $10.6 billion from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2024. The department did not provide data on fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026, when the program was originally slated to end.The new $14.4 billion cost estimate covers all years associated with the program, including Block 4-related costs dating back as far as FY13. ¡°However, over half of the increase since we reported last year ¡ª $1.9 billion ¡ª is net cost growth within various aspects of the Block 4 development program¡± and cannot be attributed to prior years¡¯ costs or planned expenses during fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2026, the GAO said.",,Valerie Insinna ,2021/3/18,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/03/18/development-costs-for-the-f-35s-modernization-program-increased-by-19b-in-a-year/
"F-35 in the crosshairs: Despite criticism, America needs the fighter jet",,"F-35A fighter jets from the 34th Fighter Squadron at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, land at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England. (Tech. Sgt. Matthew Plew/U.S. Air Force)The F-35 is in the middle of a public relations storm.With the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Adam Smith, referring to the program as a ¡°rathole¡± and news reports attacking the aircraft, the public is left to wonder about America¡¯s newest fighter. However, reality dictates a far different conclusion: The F-35 is an operational success.While the program has challenges that must be rapidly addressed, war-fighting realities demand we stay the course. Air superiority ¡ª a fighter¡¯s primary mission ¡ª is an imperative required for any successful military effort. Ships at sea, forces on the ground, space control stations and rear echelon bases will stand little chance if subject to enemy aerial attack.The U.S. has held an advantage in this regard for so long that many now take it for granted. Attacks leveled against the F-35 in recent weeks speaks to this hubris. Critics seem to want it both ways: wanting the benefits of air power while seeking to undermine necessary mission investment.Adversaries like China and Russia have long sought to challenge America¡¯s ability to project power through the air. They saw the decisive advantage yielded by U.S. air power in Operation Desert Storm and beyond. In response, they developed highly capable air defenses in the form of advanced surface-to-air missiles, next-generation fighter jets, and sophisticated sensor networks tied to command-and-control facilities.America¡¯s air power arsenal is woefully ill-equipped to face these new realities: 80 percent of the Air Force fighter inventory is comprised of aircraft designed in the 1960s and 1970s, primarily built in the 1980s and flown hard for decades. This is literally Ronald Reagan¡¯s Air Force, and that¡¯s a problem.The ability for airmen to launch into harm¡¯s way in a 30-year-old aircraft, attain mission results and get home safely is eroding precipitously. A mere 20 percent of the fighters in the inventory are built with the modern attributes of stealth, situational awareness and electronic warfare systems necessary to succeed in the modern era. The F-35 is the only U.S. fighter in production with these attributes.The critics of the F-35 do not overtly deny the challenges, but their answers to the issues invariably focus on the promise of tomorrow¡¯s solutions. Paper programs are tempting facades: They cost little in the near term, they can be anything to anyone, and they have yet to encounter the invariable technological challenges, budget growth and schedule slips that beset any modern military acquisition program.However, if the focus is always on ¡°program next,¡± the nation will never realize meaningful capabilities and capacity. Leaders will commit billions of dollars to research and development, testing, and early production, but squander these investments amid the calls for program cancellation at the very time meaningful production should accelerate. This is exactly why today¡¯s Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been since the service¡¯s founding.Whether discussing the decision to truncate B-2 production at 21 airframes, not the 132 required; the F-22 line canceled with just 187 of the 381 aircraft needed; or C-17 production halted despite a never-ending need for the type, among numerous other examples, leaders in the Department of Defense and Congress have grown far too comfortable pursuing a destructive modernization pathway that yields too little at a tremendous expense.The reality is that the perfect acquisition program never existed. Now legendary aircraft like the B-52, C-17, F-15 and F-16 were pilloried in their early years. Headlines of the time reveal scathing assaults. Yet today, these aircraft are viewed in a wholly different light. The reason for this transformation is simple: commitment. Leaders recognized that successful programs are a journey, not immediate miracles.Frankly speaking, the F-35 is doing well in this vein.The Air Force¡¯s version of the aircraft now costs less than new-build versions of older types, like the F-15EX. A 2019 report by the Government Accountability Office cited the mission-capable rate of combat-coded F-35s at 80 percent. More recently, then-Under Secretary for Acquisition and Sustainment Ellen Lord said in January 2021 that the military¡¯s F-35 mission-capable rate sits at 69 percent; however, that number included noncombat-coded aircraft. But those who fly the F-35 still rave about its performance.Many areas of the F-35 program that need improvement, like availability of spare parts, are tied to past attempts to squeeze budgets by underbuying components, not the actual design of the items themselves. Figures like the cost to fly the aircraft on an hourly basis do need to come down, but such assessments fail to recognize that a handful of F-35s can accomplish what would otherwise take more than a dozen older aircraft to accomplish, thus providing enterprise savings and better combat value at lower risk. Critics normally miss these points in their rush to attack the program as pure evil.In many ways, the attack on the F-35 is not about the aircraft. America faces tremendous fiscal challenges in the wake of COVID-19. The F-35 is one of the larger defense procurement efforts in play. Those who seek to cut defense are going after targets of opportunity absent prudent consideration regarding national security requirements.Operational realities demand the F-35¡äs capabilities in quantity. Modern alternatives would not be available until the 2030s, would run into similar teething challenges and would end up costing more. Ronald Reagan¡¯s Air Force is simply worn out, and new aircraft are needed today. Bottom line: America needs the F-35.Douglas Birkey is the executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.

Airbus tells French lawmakers there¡¯s no ¡®Plan B¡¯ for FCAS,,"Airbus and Dassault are still struggling with a way forward for the embattled sixth-generation fighter program. (Benoit Tessier/AFP/Getty Images)COLOGNE, Germany ¡ª Airbus executives said they see no viable ¡°Plan B¡± for the embattled Future Combat Air System, as Eric Trappier, the CEO of fellow prime contractor Dassault, suggested earlier this month.Antoine Bouvier, the head of Airbus strategy, mergers and public affairs, and Dirk Hoke, CEO of the aerospace giant¡¯s defense division, testified before the French Senate¡¯s foreign affairs committee on March 17 in an effort calm tensions boiling in the trinational program, known as FCAS (or SCAF in French).Airbus and Dassault are the two main contractors for the program, with work shares to be equally divided between partner nations France, Germany and Spain. The participants had envisioned kicking off the next project stage, dubbed Phase 1B, by this summer. But new disagreements over governance procedures and the sharing of industry secrets have put the program¡¯s future in question.The two Airbus executives sought to pin the program¡¯s success to the broader vision of a more independent Europe. Failure would mean the Americans can swoop in and sell their F-35 aircraft to a continent in need of its own advanced warplane industry, Bouvier argued.¡°There is is no ¡®Plan B,¡¯ ¡± he said, referring to the suggestion that Dassault¡¯s CEO made before the same committee a week prior.The Dassault boss lamented that the division of labor following Spain¡¯s inclusion would make his job as the main risk taker on the program¡¯s central element, the Next-Generation Fighter, near impossible. In addition, Airbus was on track to become too dominant a player, given that the company also has roots in Spain and Germany, he argued.Bouvier sought to dispel the idea of Dassault getting outplayed, noting that Airbus teaming arrangements include other French industry heavyweights such as Thales and MBDA. Airbus is firmly entrenched in the business of French defense, he said, suggesting the company should not be viewed as leaning too German when it comes to FCAS.The bias on both sides goes something like this, according to Bouvier: Some Germans think the French want to build a French airplane with German money, while some French think the Germans want to steal trade secrets and build a weapon of their own.The ¡°invective and polemic¡± surrounding the program ¡ª French business newspaper La Tribune had recently trashed Germany¡¯s FCAS motives in a series of articles ¡ª was beginning to ¡°pollute¡± the debate, Bouvier warned.Speaking in French during the in-person committee meeting in Paris, Hoke said Airbus made a new offer for Dassault to retain four of six strategic work packages. In addition, negotiations were ongoing about contract language for Phase 1B to preserve companies¡® unique know-how in critical domains.¡°That is easier said than done,¡± Hoke said.A speedily inked deal is critical so Germany¡¯s parliament has time to study and approve it before the summer recess in late June, Hoke said. Timing and the political context in Germany is the reason why Airbus has largely kept quiet about the FCAS kerfuffle, he added, as there is no telling how the issue would fare if dragged into Germany¡¯s election season.",,Sebastian Sprenger?,2021/3/17,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/03/17/airbus-execs-tell-french-lawmakers-they-have-no-plan-b-for-fcas/

Tim Ray, the head of Air Force Global Strike Command, told reporters last month.

(Tech. Sgt.

As a result, the Air Force will have fewer opportunities to test off-the-shelf tech it wants to mature to more seamlessly connect its sensors and shooters, Preston Dunlap said.¡°This year, we were attempting to do three evaluation events or onramps,¡± Dunlap told reporters during a roundtable. The Air Force held its first ABMS demo of the calendar year ¡ª the fourth such event since 2019 ¡ª from Feb. 22 to 25.¡°No. 5 will be coming up this summer. No. 6, though, we had to cut.

Much of the specific gear, and the role it played operationally, was classified. Allied and partner nations also played a role in the demonstration for the first time, Dunlap said.In addition, the service tested several emerging artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to help automate target recognition, he said.",,"Valerie Insinna

Here¡¯s how much one future TF-X fighter jet will cost Turkey,,"A crowd of people gather around a full-scale model of Turkish Aerospace Industries' TF-X at the Paris Air Show on June 17, 2019. (Valerie Insinna/Staff)ANKARA, Turkey ¡ª A Ukrainian engine will power Turkey¡¯s new Atak II-class T929 helicopter, the head of Turkish Aerospace Industries announced Monday in a TV interview, during which he also identified the price of the future TF-X fighter jet as $100 million per unit.Temel Kotil said the 11-ton T929, a heavier version of the T129, will be powered by a twin turboshaft 2,500-horsepower engine made in Ukraine. He did not give any further details on the engine, but said the T929 will make its maiden flight in 2023.The T929 is Turkey¡¯s second homemade helicopter gunship after the T129, which TAI produces under license from the Italian-British company AgustaWestland. It¡¯s expected to be able to carry a 1,500-kilogram payload, and perform combat, reconnaissance, surveillance, close-air support and escort missions. TAI plans to equip it with target-tracking and imaging systems, electronic warfare technology, navigation systems, communication systems, and weapons.The CEO also said the TF-X, Turkey¡¯s first indigenous fighter jet in the making, will make its maiden flight in 2025, with plans for the aircraft to enter the Turkish Air Force¡¯s inventory in 2029. He added that the TF-X will come at a cost of $100 million per unit.TAI will produce two TF-X aircraft per month, hoping to generate $2.4 billion in annual revenue from its fighter jet program. At present, Kotil said, 1,000 of TAI¡¯s 4,000 engineers are working on the TF-X program.",,Burak Ege Bekdil ,2021/3/16,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/techwatch/2021/03/16/heres-how-much-one-future-tf-x-fighter-jet-will-cost-turkey/
First Air Force takes on new role supporting US Space Command,,"A 138th Fighter Wing Viper out of Tulsa Air National Guard Base, Okla., provides NORAD and First Air Force with temporary flight restriction zone enforcement during the Nov. 15, 2020, SpaceX launch. (Master Sgt. C.T. Michael/Air Guard)The Air Force has tapped Florida-based First Air Force as the new air component to U.S. Space Command, providing air support to the military¡¯s daily space operations.It¡¯s the latest step as part of the Pentagon¡¯s sweeping slate of space reforms that have breathed new life into SPACECOM and revamped how the military wields satellites and radars.First Air Force, headquartered at Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., will command and control the USAF assets that assist SPACECOM on everyday missions, with a particular focus on domestic airspace. That stems from the organization¡¯s longtime work with U.S. Northern Command and NORAD to protect the continental U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico from attack.¡°First Air Force was the natural choice to serve as Air Force component to U.S. Space Command,¡± Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles ¡°CQ¡± Brown said in a March 11 release. ¡°In this new role, First Air Force will be better able to identify and address gaps and seams when integrating spacepower into the support of the homeland defense mission. This will also inform efforts to better fuse space operations into air operations centers around the globe.That indicates First Air Force will look at new ways to incorporate satellite communications, missile tracking and other types of space data into daily homeland defense. It plans to continue operating as Air Forces Northern even as it puts more attention on space.First Air Force could also play a part in managing Air Force C-17s, HH-60s and other rescue forces dispatched when certain astronauts are stranded at sea, such as in case of an International Space Station evacuation.¡°The U.S. Air Force is a critical contributor to the U.S. Space Command mission as evidenced by their support to human spaceflight,¡± SPACECOM boss Army Gen. James Dickinson said in the release. ¡°We welcome First Air Force to our joint team.¡±Dickinson argues his command is unique because it enables U.S. military campaigns by passing data around the world, but also needs friendly forces to protect satellite ground controls or to go after enemies that are interfering with American signals.",,"Rachel S.

Reaction Engines chases the elusive prospect of a hypersonic fighter jet,,"An artist rendering by Reaction Engines shows a potential application of the company's Sabre engine on an aircraft. (Reaction Engines)LONDON ¡ª A hypersonic propulsion company backed by Rolls-Royce, Boeing and BAE Systems has taken a step closer to developing an engine capable of powering combat jets and other aircraft at speeds of up to Mach 5 following tests of two subsystems vital to the success of the design.British-based Reaction Engines said the recently completed tests of full-scale heat exchanger and hydrogen pre-burner subsystems validated the design of what are key components required to supply heat energy and air to the core of the air-breathing engine.Reaction Engines, which also has a U.S. test operation in Denver, Colorado, has worked for decades on its Sabre synergetic, air-breathing rocket engine for aerospace applications, including for combat jets and to assist vehicles into space.In recent years the work has attracted BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, Boeing Horizon X and others to invest in the company. The British government has also ploughed millions of pounds into the company¡¯s design effort. Ministry of Defence funding has gone toward Reaction Engines¡¯ work with Rolls-Royce and BAE for the possible application of high-Mach know-how on the sixth-generation Tempest fighter project.The latest test success comes as the field of hypersonic technology becomes increasing attractive in the West, triggered in part by rapid technological advances by potential adversaries.Other Western engine companies are also investing in hypersonic propulsion. Pratt & Whitney recently confirmed it is developing a hypersonic engine it calls the Metacomet. The company designed the J58 engine that powered the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane to a record speed of about Mach 3.4 in the 1960s.Adam Dissel, the president of Reaction Engines¡¯ U.S. operation, said the effort to advance in the hypersonics sector is generating plenty of cross-Atlantic dialogue between Washington and London.¡°There is great collaboration between the U.S. and U.K., and there are lots of discussions happening as to how we collaborate on these technologies,¡± he said.The success of the trials on the heat exchanger, known as the HX3, and the pre-burner is another step in the right direction to maturing Reaction Engines¡¯ technology. The latest tests follow trials undertaken in 2019 in Denver, where the company undertook high-temperature airflow testing for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency¡¯s HTX program.The company reported at the time that its proprietary ultra-lightweight heat exchanger used in the test was exposed to hypersonic conditions approaching 1,000 degrees Celsius, or roughly 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat exchanger performed its pre-cooler function by quenching about 1,800-degree Fahrenheit temperatures in less than one-twentieth of a second, according to the company.Dissel said that together the three tests successfully demonstrate key subsystems not previously used in an aerospace environment.¡°The company is very focused on maturing the subsystems that are fundamentally new to aerospace. Pre-cooler was the big one, and now with the innovative HX3 heat exchanger and pre-burner tests, these are three key components very specific to Sabre,¡± he told Defense News on March 5. ¡°We are well past the hump in terms of validating the fundamental pieces. Putting it together as an integrated device able to go five times the speed of sound is still a big challenge, so from an overall integration standpoint we are at the beginning.Adam Dissel leads the U.S.-based subsidiary of Reaction Engines in Denver, Colo. (Reaction Engines)Adam Dissel leads the U.S.-based subsidiary of Reaction Engines in Denver, Colo. (Reaction Engines)¡°There are some additional components that are in the works, but the next real, major milestone for us is to put several of those subsystems together in what would be cooperative operation of a Sabre on the ground. In the first instance it wouldn¡¯t be a full engine generating thrust, but it would demonstrate the full behavior of the [engine] cycle to prove the validity of the concept.¡±When might we see Reaction Engines move to the next stage and conduct a Sabre engine core test? The company said last year that could happen in the next 12-18 months. Now, however, there appears less willingness to discuss dates.Answering a question about timing, Dissel said Reaction Engines continually evaluates what can be done in terms of funding and customers, including the British government. ¡°Certainly it is in the technology plan, but timing is somewhat funding-dependent.¡±In the meantime, Reaction Engines is generating revenue through its own by marketing efforts and making the individual elements of the technology it has developed available to commercial markets. The company has created an applied technologies division in the U.K. that offers thermal management and other products for the aerospace, energy, environmental and automotive sectors, among others. Dissel expects to see the company secure its first commercial contracts this year.¡°As a company we are looking at the near-, mid- and far-term revenue-generating opportunities. Our investors would like to see a return on investment, and their interests span that gamut. So as a company we are very much diversifying and looking at what can be addressed in all three of those areas,¡± he said.However, it¡¯s not just about generating returns for shareholders, he noted.¡°The revenue along the way is important, but we also see the opportunity to be maturing and gaining experience and credibility with these enabling technologies,¡± he said. ¡°Midterm you will see coming online systems where we believe Sabre-derived technology will enable faster flight.¡±That ambition potentially got a boost in 2019 when the British MoD signed a deal with Rolls-Royce, Reaction Engines and BAE to undertake high-Mach propulsion studies in parallel with early work being conducted on the Tempest sixth-generation fighter, under development by Britain and its partners Italy and Sweden.Updating the EJ200 engine, which powers the Typhoon fighter, with Reaction Engines¡¯ know-how might be another option, a senior Royal Air Force officer suggested at the time of the announcement.¡°The full Sabre engine design is at the end of the road map, offering a complete revolution in the way we access space. That doesn¡¯t come online until the mid-2030s as a fully operational system,¡± Dissel said.",,Andrew Chuter ,2021/3/15,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/03/15/reaction-engines-chases-the-elusive-prospect-of-a-hypersonic-fighter-jet/

The KC-46 tanker¡¯s most infamous problem isn¡¯t the one that impacts pilots the most,,"Capt. Wesley Cobb, 4th Airlift Squadron pilot, conducts an aerial refueling from a KC-46 from McConnell Air Force Base, Kan., on Feb. 20, 2021. (Senior Airman Mikayla Heineck/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force is on its way to ameliorating a technical glitch that has left KC-46 tanker pilots waiting to take off, sometimes for hours, as a key system starts up.The problem revolves around the Boeing-made tanker¡¯s On-Board Inert Gas Generation System, which is used to convert oxygen in the aircraft¡¯s fuel tanks to nitrogen, preventing the aircraft from exploding if the tanks are hit by lightning or enemy fire.During a walk-through of the KC-46 held last month at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, two pilots told reporters that ¡ª under current regulations ¡ª pilots are prohibited from taking off in a KC-46 until the OBIGGS is fully booted up, with a countdown timer on the aircraft¡¯s display reading ¡°zero.¡±¡°That system right now, on average, takes just over an hour and a half to complete its duties,¡± said Maj. Tim McBride, an instructor pilot with the 931st Air Refueling Wing at McConnell Air Force Base in Kansas.But it can take longer, he said, noting that maintainers had turned on the system that day at around 7 a.m., but it was still starting up hours later.¡°[The OBIGGS countdown timer] will start at 99, and it will just tick down and we can¡¯t do anything until that timer gets to zero,¡± said Capt. Michelle McMillen, a KC-46 pilot and the 22nd Operations Group executive officer. ¡°It¡¯s very cumbersome. Sometimes it will randomly reset, and we don¡¯t know why, and then we have to wait for it.¡±The problem is a category 2 deficiency, which isn¡¯t considered to have a major impact on safety or operations, said Brig. Gen. Ryan Samuelson, who leads the Air Force¡¯s KC-46 cross-functional team, which coordinates the continued development and fielding of the tanker.The issue doesn¡¯t rise to the level of notoriety seen with the KC-46¡äs category 1 problems, which include a boom that cannot refuel the A-10 Warthog and a Remote Vision System with cameras that do not provide the acuity necessary for boom operators to refuel planes in all lighting conditions without greater risk of scraping the receiver aircraft.But pilots said the OBIGGS problem can be an annoyance, and they pointed to the issue as one they would like to see fixed.¡°That system makes the [Federal Aviation Administration] very happy in the certification of [the aircraft] for safety purposes. But coming from a background where I was trained how to do scramble launching, that¡¯s kind of counterproductive to that,¡± McBride said.A short-term solution could be in place as soon as next month. The Air Force has approved a procedural change that would allow pilots to take off even if the OBIGGS timer is still counting down, a spokeswoman for Air Mobility Command said in a statement. Once the new policy is incorporated into the KC-46 flight manual, which is slated to occur in April 2021, it will go into effect.¡°The KC-46 can safely taxi/take off before the OBIGGS timer reaches zero and a procedural change will be published and released to the field to allow crews to taxi/take off prior to the OBIGGS timer reaching zero,¡± the spokeswoman said. ¡°In this case, the OBIGGS system will continue to inert during taxi, takeoff, and flight. ¡­ In a deployed scenario, operational commanders would assess threats and establish any additional guidance.¡±The Air Force is still in search of a permanent solution to the OBIGGS deficiency, which was first documented in April 2019.¡°As we fielded the aircraft, we realized that the way in which we power up the aircraft with the boom checks and all of that is causing problems in that algorithm and causing it to reset,¡± Samuelson said. ¡°Boeing is working on a fix for us.¡±The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46s over the program of record. The service already received more than 40 tankers from prime contractor Boeing.Last month, Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost, who leads Air Mobility Command, announced that the Air Force would start to make the KC-46 available to U.S. Transportation Command for certain operations ¡ª which would not include wartime missions in the Middle East or any refueling mission involving stealth aircraft.After a visit to McConnell Air Force Base, U.S. Transportation Command chief Gen. Stephen Lyons said the Air force could make the aircraft available ¡°for limited mission requirements¡± as early as June, according to a March 6 tweet by the command.",,Valerie Insinna ,2021/3/12,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/03/12/the-kc-46-tankers-most-infamous-problem-isnt-the-one-that-impacts-pilots-the-most/

A second aircraft is due to arrive at Eglin next month, and the remaining six aircraft in the first lot will fly to Eglin in fiscal year 2023 for operational testing.The Air Force placed its first order for the F-15EX in July 2020, awarding a contract for the first lot of eight jets with a value not to exceed about $1.2 billion. The entire program has a ceiling value of $23 billion. It plans to buy at least 144 F-15EXs to replace the F-15C/D fleet, which is at an average age of 37 years and starting to see structural strain. However, the contract has options that would allow the service to buy up to 200 jets.The second lot of F-15EX planes is on schedule for delivery in fiscal year 2024 to Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base in Oregon, which will also serve as the site for F-15EX training.

Raytheon wins $178 million contract to support Air Force intel-sharing system,,"Sensors aboard the MQ-9 Reaper and other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms feed into the U.S. Air Force's Distributed Common Ground System, a system of systems that the service wants to transition to an open architecture. (Photo courtesy of Chalk 2 for the 163d Attack Wing)WASHINGTON ¨D The U.S. Air Force selected Raytheon Technologies to transition the service¡¯s primary intelligence-sharing system, awarding the company $178 million.Raytheon will provide field support for the Distributed Common Ground System Enterprise, the Air Force¡¯s main system for planning, collection, processing and disseminating intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, under the March 10 contract. According to the Air Force, its DCGS draws in data from airborne sensors aboard the RQ-4 Global Hawk, Mq-1 Predator, MQ-9 Reaper and other ISR platforms all over the globe.The DCGS Enterprise is effectively a system of systems developed and procured separately over time, resulting in a variety of stovepiped, closed architecture solutions. The Air Force wants to move to an open architecture, and under this contract Raytheon will provide support for that transition.Work on the five-year contract is expected to be completed in 2026.Meanwhile, the Air Force is considering hiring a contractor to build out that open architecture, enabling the service to more readily integrate data from the intelligence community and commercial providers into DCGS.On Feb. 25, the Air Force issued a notice to identify vendors capable of managing ¡°the development and integration of new capabilities¡± for DCGS. The service is considering awarding a multiyear/multiaward indefinite delivery/indefinite quanity contract to that end, called Air Force DCGS Requirements Supports Services.Among other things, the contract would help develop a government-owned open architecture that could link Air Force systems to emerging geospatial intelligence capabilities being developed by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and commercial providers. The upgraded system would be able to more rapidly integrate new data sources, in part by setting meta data standards.In essence, the project would transform DCGS to an open architecture that can accept more data from the intelligence community and commercial providers, integrate that data, and use artificial intelligence to create multi-intelligence analysis.",,Nathan Strout,2021/3/11,https://www.c4isrnet.com/intel-geoint/2021/03/11/raytheon-wins-178-million-contract-to-support-air-force-intel-sharing-system/

(ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/Getty Images)PARIS ¨C Dassault Aviation CEO Eric Trappier, whose company leads the tri-national New Generation Fighter (NGF) destined to replace France¡¯s Rafales, Germany¡¯s Typhoons and Spain¡¯s EF-18 Hornets, has admitted that there is ¡°trouble¡± afoot with implementing the program¡¯s next stage, dubbed 1B.The phase involves getting Spain and additional suppliers on board. The mandate to include Spain¡¯s industry means that work share between Dassault and Airbus, instead of being split 50/50, is now split three ways, with Airbus holding 66 percent, as it represents Germany and Spain.¡°I¡¯ve accepted that,¡± Trappier said, ¡°but it¡¯s made sharing the work in all the packages, including the strategic ones, more complicated.¡±The fighter program is part of the Future Combat Air System effort, which envisions networked drones accompanying the manned aircraft, and a combat cloud architecture pulling all elements together.Trappier said that ¡°we still believe in this program,¡± which was an ¡°efficient¡± way for the three nations to develop a sixth-generation aircraft at a reasonable cost. However, he said any responsible chief executive ¡°tries his very best to make Plan A work, but always has a Plan B.¡±In this case it would appear that France¡¯s Plan B is to go it alone on this program. Trappier pointed out that ¡°in terms of technology, Dassault knows how to build aircraft alone. Safran knows how to make engines for combat aircraft. Thales knows about electronics, and MBDA missiles,¡± so French industry has all the know-how necessary.Speaking at a virtual press conference Friday to announce Dassault¡¯s 2020 financial results, Trappier explained that currently the partners ¡°are butting against the one-third-each share of [industrial] work packages between us, Airbus Germany and Airbus Spain.¡± He explained that in the joint work packages ¡°nobody holds responsibility.¡± He cited the flight control strategic work package as an example of an obstacle. ¡°There¡¯s no boss, but we are the prime on this program and as such are responsible to our government,¡± he said. ¡°Dassault has to have the levers to action our responsibility.¡±Addressing the issue of intellectual property he stressed that the ¡°there will be no black box¡± in the sense that ¡°all the states will have access to all the boxes.¡± But he remarked that ¡°it is the creator who remains the owner [of the intellectual property], and we have 70 years worth of experience. Nobody can force me to give away our intellectual property.¡±Regarding the prospect of a second NGF demonstrator, called for by German unions to preserve design capability, Trappier pointed out that this ¡°is not planned for and has not been requested by the states,¡± and was a ¡°problem between the states.¡± But he said that if there were to be a second demonstrator built, ¡°it would be under identical conditions as the first one.¡±Regardless of how the program proceeds, France¡¯s sixth-generation aircraft ¡°must be compatible with an aircraft-carrier, which obviously weighs on the decisions,¡± Trappier said.",,Christina Mackenzie ,2021/3/5,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/03/05/dassault-boss-trappier-floats-plan-b-considerations-for-the-troubled-fcas-warplane/

During Roper¡¯s tenue with the Air Force, the service started AFWERX, which aims to give contracts to startups and other businesses who don¡¯t typically do business with the government. In 2012, while at the Pentagon, Roper established and directed the Strategic Capabilities Office created to rapidly modify existing systems to address emerging threats.¡°Dr. Will Roper joins Volansi¡¯s board with a reputation as a transformative, forward-looking leader,¡± said Volansi CEO and co-Founder Hannan Parvizian. ¡°His deep expertise in emerging technologies and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in logistics operations will be instrumental in aiding Volansi¡¯s mission to change the future of supply chain.¡±According to Volansi, Roper ¡°will focus on the company¡¯s strategy, operations, and growth in defense markets.¡± There are several near-term opportunities for Volansi to sell its products to the U.S. military.One is an AFWERX project that Roper championed, known as Agility Prime, where the Air Force is seeking to experiment with technologies from the burgeoning commercial electronic vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) market to see whether they could be used to transport troops or conduct logistics missions.According to the Air Force, 19 companies have applied to participate in the Agility Prime air race. Although the service has not specified which firms are involved in the effort, Volansi has indicated interest in the program, having debuted a new cargo drone called the VOLY M20 during a launch event in May 2020.Volansi is already a player in developing the service¡¯s Skyborg AI-equipped drone, after being awarded a contract in December 2020. The company has also received money from the Air Force through the Small Business Innovation Research program.In a statement, Roper said that innovative commercial tech companies like Volansi are disrupting the way the Pentagon typically does business.¡°Bringing speed and agility historically absent in government procurement, many vendors have early revenue-generating opportunities in national security as a path to commercial success,¡± Roper said. ¡°Volansi is uniquely positioned in the commercial UAV market because of their focus on cargo and logistics, both huge components of modern militaries.

Australia makes another order for Boeing¡¯s Loyal Wingman drones after a successful first flight,,"Boeing's Airpower Teaming System conducts its maiden flight on March 1, 2021 over Australia. (Royal Australian Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The Royal Australian Air Force on Tuesday signed a $115 million contract to buy three more autonomous ¡°Loyal Wingman¡± drones from Boeing, raising its total order to six aircraft just days after the first system made its inaugural flight.Following a series of ground tests to validate its navigation and pilot control systems, the first Loyal Wingman ¡ª which Boeing also calls the Airpower Teaming System ¡ª took flight from Woomera Range Complex in South Australia on Feb. 27, the company announced on Monday.During the flight, the aircraft followed a preplanned route where the vehicle flew at different speeds and altitudes. The drone was monitored by a Boeing test pilot located on site.¡°Most of the interaction by the human is really in mission planning,¡± said Shane Arnott, Boeing¡¯s ATS program director. ¡°The test pilot was in the loop throughout. He gave commands at each phase, if you will ¡ªtaxi, takeoff, return ¡­ it¡¯s almost as simple as that.¡±Eventually, the Loyal Wingman will be able to fly autonomously with manned fighter jets, and may even use artificial intelligence in order to respond to new information on the battlefield. However, for this first flight, testing the drone¡¯s AI capabilities was not a major priority, Arnott said.In a statement, RAAF Air Vice-Marshal Cath Roberts, Australia¡¯s head of air force capability, called the first flight a significant step forward for the program.¡°The Loyal Wingman project is a pathfinder for the integration of autonomous systems and artificial intelligence to create smart human-machine teams,¡± she said. ¡°Through this project we are learning how to integrate these new capabilities to complement and extend air combat and other missions.¡±The Loyal Wingman air vehicle is 38 feet long and has a 24 foot wingspan, with a removable nose that can be packed with mission-specific sensors and other payloads. It can fly at a range in excess of 2,000 nautical miles.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeThe ATS is the ¡°first military combat aircraft to be designed, engineered and manufactured in Australia in more than 50 years,¡± according to Boeing. More than 35 Australian companies, including BAE Systems Australia, RUAG Australia, AME Systems and Ferra Engineering, are involved in the production of the aircraft.Boeing rolled out the first ATS system in May 2020, and has other aircraft in development. Arnott declined to discuss future tests of the system or when the six systems would be delivered to the RAAF.Soon Australia won¡¯t be the only air force operating the system.

MDA says Alaska-based missile defense radar will be operational in 2021,,"Clear Air Force Station¡¯s $347 million Long Range Discrimination Radar complex is seen June 6, 2018. (John Budnik/Army Corps of Engineers)WASHINGTON ¡ª Despite previously reported delays from the Government Accountability Office and the Missile Defense Agency, a key U.S. Air Force radar designed to detect ballistic missile threats appears to be on track to reach initial operational capability in fiscal 2021, according to an MDA announcement.The MDA provided information to the GAO in June that indicated all construction and integration activities for the Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR), based at at Clear Air Force Station, Alaska, had stopped last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The program went into ¡°caretaker status,¡± meaning just a small group stayed at the site to ensure the materials were protected from the elements.This meant the initial fielding planned for FY21 was delayed and the Air Force would not take ownership of the operational radar until FY23, according to the GAO report.The LRDR is an S-band radar that will not only be able to track incoming ballistic and hypersonic missiles but also discriminate the warhead-carrying vehicle from decoys and other nonlethal objects for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System, which is designed to protect the continental U.S. from possible intercontinental ballistic missile threats from North Korea and Iran. Lockheed Martin is LRDR¡¯s manufacturer.¡°We did have some fallback in developing and delivery of systems because it requires people to be in close, confined spaces and sitting at computer terminals working through really tough problems like the development of an algorithm,¡± MDA Director Vice Adm. Jon Hill said at the virtually held Space and Missile Defense Symposium last summer.However, MDA says that as of the last week of February, the LRDR is ¡°currently undergoing radar installation¡± at Clear and ¡°is on track for delivery and Initial Operational Capability in 2021, having completed all major production activities as well as array panel and equipment installation.¡±With Alaska reopening to travelers from the rest of the country, military construction resumed in May and radar integration resumed in July, according to MDA.¡°Despite the challenges, the Corps of Engineers in Alaska, the State of Alaska, the Missile Defense Agency and the many contractors involved in the construction of the LRDR have been working together towards achieving IOC by the end of this calendar year,¡± the statement notes.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeAccording to the GAO, the current test plan for LRDR has just one flight test scheduled in the third quarter of FY21, after two ground tests. The report does not clarify if the pandemic caused a delay in these tests, and the MDA announcement does not lay out a test schedule for the system.The GAO indicated concern about conducting two ground tests before the program¡¯s only flight test, as it ¡°increases the likelihood that the models will not be accredited when testing is complete.¡±As a result, ¡°the performance analysis and the majority of the model validation and accreditation will have to be made concurrently, just prior to the LRDR Technical Capability Declaration,¡± scheduled for the third quarter of FY21, the report stated. ¡°This increases the risk of discovering issues late in development, which could result in performance reductions or delivery delays.¡±",,Jen Judson ,2021/3/2,https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2021/03/02/mda-says-alaska-based-missile-defense-radar-will-be-operational-in-2021/
NORAD is using artificial intelligence to see the threats it used to miss,,"A small helicopter sits on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol on April 15, 2015. NORAD says its new artificial intelligence system would have detected the potential threat. (Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. military command charged with watching and protecting North American airspace is now using artificial intelligence to detect the threats that previously slipped its notice.The new capability, named Pathfinder, fuses data from military, commercial and government sensors to create a common operating picture for North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command.¡°It essentially takes and ingests ¡ª aggregates ¡ª data from multiple systems, data that would in the past have been ... left on the cutting room floor and not analyzed or assessed in a timely manner,¡± said Gen. Glen VanHerck, who commands NORAD and USNORTHCOM, during the Air Force Association¡¯s virtual Air Warfare Symposium last week. ¡°The Pathfinder program uses machine learning to help us analyze that data from multiple systems ¡ª not only military systems, but commercial systems, other government agency systems.¡±Previously that data stayed in separate systems, preventing NORAD from seeing the whole picture and allowing potential threats to slip through unnoticed. VanHerck pointed to a 2015 incident when a gyrocopter landed on the White House lawn as an example of how stovepiped systems prevented NORAD from seeing a potential threat.¡°When you go back and look at that scenario, when you look at those systems that monitor the national Capitol region individually, no single system had full awareness or saw that gyrocopter,¡± he explained.Pathfinder solves that problem by taking the data from each of those systems and fusing it into a common operating picture. In developing Pathfinder, NORAD virtually recreated the 2015 event by plugging the data from that day into its new AI-machine learning capability.¡°We took Pathfinder and applied it to the available systems, the actual data, and used Pathfinder capabilities to assess that data,¡± said VanHerck. ¡°And sure enough, there that gyrocopter was and he was easily detected by that point.¡±To prototype pathfinder, NORAD partnered with the Defense Innovation Unit, a Pentagon organization that specializes in using emerging commercial technologies for military purposes.

Historically our sectors were very manually driven ¡ª phone calls to pass data, etc. Today we fuse all that data together, and we¡¯re seeing the picture much more real-time and much more in an automatic type of digital environment.¡±Pathfinder can fuse data from more than 300 sensors to build its common operating picture, Brown noted. Beyond helping NORAD find more potential threats, Pathfinder also enables operators to move faster to assess those threats.¡°We dramatically reduced their decision time ¡ª they have about 12 minutes to make a decision if they really thought there was an attack coming in over North American airspace ¡ª and we¡¯ve cut minutes off that by giving them this common operating picture,¡± said Brown.In many ways, Pathfinder is a microcosm of the Pentagon¡¯s Joint All Domain Command and Control concept, which seeks to use AI and emerging technologies to connect every sensor to the best shooter.¡°What we¡¯ve been able to do with NORAD in this fusing of sensor data and providing a common operating picture for better decision making, if you think about it, that¡¯s the guts of what¡¯s in JADC2,¡± said Brown. ¡°That technology is going to continue to have broad applicability. And I won¡¯t be surprised at all as we work on some other projects to see other applications of that basic technology be delivered.¡±¡°I absolutely believe it can be a model for the Department of Defense,¡± said VanHerck. ¡°It lays the foundation for improved data-driven decision-making and enhanced capability.¡±Defense News Deputy Editor and Senior Pentagon Correspondent Aaron Mehta contributed to this report.",,Nathan Strout,2021/3/1,https://www.c4isrnet.com/artificial-intelligence/2021/03/01/norad-is-using-artificial-intelligence-to-see-the-threats-it-used-to-miss/

Kenneth Wilsbach, commander of Pacific Air Forces, who told reporters Feb. 24 that he is in favor of a near-term purchase of the Boeing 737-based Wedgetail to replace the aging E-3 Sentry, which is based on the older Boeing 707 and colloquially called ¡°AWACS.¡±¡°The fact is, we actually need something relatively quick because of the reliability of the E-3,¡± Wilsbach said, according to Air Force Magazine. ¡°It gets harder and harder to get airborne.¡±The Air Force currently maintains an inventory of 31 E-3s, which were produced between 1971 and 1984. The E-3 is expected to fly until 2035, but the task of maintaining the aircraft is becoming harder as parts become obsolete and more difficult to source.Because of ¡°sustainment challenges related to supply of needed parts and maintenance of the aging aircraft,¡± the Air Force¡¯s E-3 fleet did not meet its availability goals in fiscal years 2011 through 2019, the Government Accountability Office stated in a 2020 report.The U.S. Air Force has not rolled out a plan for replacing the E-3, but rumors have swirled over recent years about the service¡¯s interest in adding the Wedgetail to its budget if enough money can be found. However, there currently is no Air Force program of record for the E-7 Wedgetail.Boeing originally developed the E-7 for the Royal Australian Air Force, which introduced the plane into service in 2009.

Air Force general busts myth that enemies always try to stop rivals¡¯ communications,,"If adversaries won't always disconnect systems, what changes must the military make to adjust to adversaries inside systems? (U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Christopher Hubenthal)WASHINGTON ¡ª A top Air Force general wants to dispel the common assumption that adversaries will always try to cut or jam U.S. troops¡¯ friendly communications.Instead, they might want to leave those communications intact to use them to spread false and misleading information, for example, said Lt. Gen. Mary O¡¯Brien, Air Force deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and cyber effects operations, during the Air Force Association virtual Aerospace Warfare Symposium on Feb. 25.To prepare against potential hacking or jamming of systems that could take troops offline, the military is working to harden its communications, electronics and other digital equipment.While this resiliency is welcome, the military must not ignore other vulnerabilities, O¡¯Brien said.¡°If our adversaries are not incentivized to disconnect us for their security, would that perhaps mean they want to maintain that connection in order to inject disinformation or misinformation and take advantage of opportunities that way,¡± she said. ¡°Would they want to inject counter machine learning or counter artificial intelligence where their capabilities could corrupt ours? Could they attack our data in our algorithm integrity? What capabilities would we require then if we turn that assumption and looked at it from a different perspective?¡±The misconception that adversaries¡¯ priority is to cut communications has surfaced recently, O¡¯Brien has noticed.

As such, the Pentagon likely won¡¯t be able to rake in the $1 billion of savings that the company projected with the original offer, said Ken Merchant, the company¡¯s vice president for F-35 sustainment. Instead, Lockheed Martin worked to shrink the scope of the contract ¡°to something that the customers were comfortable with,¡± he told reporters Tuesday.¡°With the new, reduced scope, we have not completely run all the models yet.

"Despite growing pains, KC-46 tanker will begin ¡®limited operations¡¯",,"A KC-46A Pegasus arrives at McConnell Air Force Base, Kan., on Jan. 31, 2019. This is the fourth KC-46 McConnell received since the initial arrival on Jan. 25, 2019. (Airman 1st Class Alexi Myrick/U.S. Air Force)JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. ¡ª The U.S. Air Force is preparing to offer some new KC-46 tankers for operational use as early as this year, although continued technical issues will keep the aircraft from combat missions.Under the new plan, announced by Air Mobility Command chief Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost on Feb. 24, the Air Force will commit a certain number of KC-46s to execute operational missions tasked by U.S. Transportation Command, which manages how the U.S. military transports people and equipment around the globe.¡°You may be surprised to know that the KC-46 is already executing four to six missions daily in support of service and joint training missions. In fact, since last October, the KC-46 executed more than 650 missions across the globe,¡± Van Ovost told reporters during a roundtable.¡°For example, today the KC-46 may provide aerial refueling for F-16s participating in a U.S.-based training exercise,¡± she said. ¡°Under this new approach, if AMC is tasked to provide [aerial refueling] support for an operational coronet mission to move F-18s overseas or an operational B-52 mission, the KC-46 is on the table, which frees up KC-135s and KC-10s to execute other combatant command deployments that the KC-46 is presently unable to support with its existing deficiencies.¡±Air Mobility Command is still finalizing the conditions that must be met before KC-46s become available to Transportation Command. Van Ovost said that ¡°until these measures are met, the KC-46 will not be cleared to provide operational support for a particular mission set or a milestone.¡±The Air Force has yet to determine how many tankers will be presented and when, said Brig. Gen. Ryan Samuelson, who leads the Air Force¡¯s KC-46 cross-functional team, which coordinates the continued development and fielding of the tanker. However, the team hopes the new aircraft reaches limited operations later this year, he told reporters during a Feab. 23 event at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland.¡°As we looked at all of its mission sets ¡ª cargo, air refueling, aeromedical [evacuation], passenger movements ¡ª what we realized is over the last year the crews are becoming more seasoned, the system is getting more primed to support the aircraft and our confidence level is gaining that we actually have operational capacity out there that we can provide for the joint force,¡± he said.¡°Every mission set that this aircraft can take off of those older tanker fleets, that¡¯s more capacity back to the combatant commands, and it relieves that stress on our current tanker fleet,¡± he added.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe Air Force currently has 44 KC-46s of the 179 it plans to buy over the program of record. By the end of 2021, that number will be up to 60 tankers, Samuelson said.However, there are a number of missions that the KC-46 will not be permitted to perform until its critical deficiencies are resolved and the Air Force deems it fully operational, Van Ovost said. Namely, it will not be allowed to perform wartime missions in the Middle East for U.S. Central Command, nor will it be tasked for missions in U.S. European Command or U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.A KC-46 tanker refuels an A-10 during testing. (John D. Parker/Boeing)A KC-46 tanker refuels an A-10 during testing. (John D. Parker/Boeing)It will also be restricted from refueling stealth planes such as the F-35, F-22 and B-2, which all feature a low-observable coating that protects them from radar detection, Samuelson said. Air Force officials believe the KC-46 is at higher risk of damaging stealth coatings with its refueling boom because of longstanding issues with the Remote Vision System, a collection of cameras and infrared sensors used by operators to steer the tanker¡¯s boom into a fuel receptacle.Refueling the A-10 Warthog is also off the table due to the stiffness of the boom. The Air Force is financially responsible for fixing this issue, as it approved Boeing¡¯s boom design in 2016. The service awarded the company an additional $55.5 million in 2019 to design a new boom actuator to solve the problem.Van Ovost stressed that the KC-46 would only be permitted for limited operational use as long as efforts to fix remaining critical deficiencies do not slow down.¡°I remain confident that accepting the KC-46 with known deficiencies offers the fastest route to fielding a fully operational weapon system,¡± she said. ¡°That said, serious deficiencies and restrictions remain with the KC-46 weapon system, and Boeing is still responsible for installing Remote Visual System 2.0 and redesigning the boom telescope actuator.¡±Van Ovost, Samuelson and others recently briefed Transportation Command leaders about the plan to make the KC-46 available for operational missions. Van Ovost characterized the command officials as ¡°receptive¡± to the plan.They also briefed acting Air Force Secretary John Roth, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. CQ Brown and several members of Congress ¡ª all of which flew aboard KC-46s this week during orientation flights meant to showcase the performance of the tanker and its ability to refuel aircraft like the F-15 and F-16.

Israel¡¯s Defense Ministry said it is also pursuing additional F-35 fighter jets (beyond the 50 it already has agreed to buy), more helicopters, advanced munitions and other weapon systems.Israel will use the Foreign Military Financing program from the U.S. to acquire the new tankers. The multibillion-dollar deal was approved by the U.S. State Department in March 2020.Israel¡¯s fleet of converted Boeing 707s are decades old and in need of replacing. In July 2020, reports indicated Israel was seeking to speed up the possible delivery of the KC-46s. However, a budget dispute held up the decision for six months. Recent weeks saw rapid advances in the decision-making process and approvals.¡°I welcome the progress in the procurement plan, which is critical at this point in time. It is a cornerstone of the IDF¡¯s security concept,¡± said Defense Minister Benny Gantz, using an acronym for the Israel Defense Forces.Israel is heading to elections next month, and Gantz¡¯s Blue and White political party is struggling in the polls.

The Israeli government maintains that the procurement plan is based on U.S. security assistance, which ¡°is crucial to strengthening the IAF [Israeli Air Force] and for the IDF¡¯s QME [qualitative military edge] in the decades to come.¡±Israel¡¯s QME is a concept that ensures the country can defeat any credible conventional military threat from any individual state, coalition of states or nonstate actors. The QME was a topic of discussion between Gantz and then-U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in October 2020.In comments on Feb. 22, Gantz thanked the United States for supporting Israel. ¡°We will continue to work to complete the agreements that will enable the IDF to fulfill its purpose and to move forward with the missions facing us in the various arenas, near and far, at sea, in the air, on land and in cyberspace,¡± he said.According to the Israeli government, ¡°in the next phase, two additional tanker aircraft will be acquired out of a total of up to eight that will make up the future fleet.¡± The KC-46s will be fitted with Israeli systems, which is the case for a number of aircraft acquired from the U.S., such as the fifth-generation F-35.

Keep all B-1 and B-2 bombers until the new B-21 is available,,"Football fans watch U.S. Air Force strategic bombers ¡ª from left, B-52H Stratofortress, B-2 Spirit and B-1B Lancer ¡ª fly as they gather outside of the Raymond James Stadium during the Super Bowl match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 7, 2021. (Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images)It was brief and it was dark, but the flyover of three U.S. Air Force bombers in formation at Super Bowl LV signaled more to the world than just a fleeting flyby.The crisp formation of the B-1, B-2 and B-52 was another of many recent events showcasing the resurgence of Air Force bombers globally. With more frequent bomber deployments and flybys in the Indo-Pacific and Middle East regions, the Air Force is rediscovering the value of transoceanic bombers in strengthening deterrence and enforcing containment of Chinese, Russian and Iranian expansion. They are also a clear reminder to the nation of the vital importance of retaining a large force of conventional and nuclear-capable bombers.In the past six months, B-1s have flown long-duration, nonstop missions from Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas to the Middle East as a signal to Iran that American bombers are present and can attack from anywhere on short notice.At the same time, B-52s from Minot AFB in North Dakota and Barksdale AFB in Louisiana have flown both nonstop missions from these bases and missions while deployed to Guam. Bombers have maintained a near-continuous presence at Guam with continuous rotations of B-1s, B-2s and B-52s.In its defense plans last year, the Air Force anticipated cutting its bomber force by incrementally retiring all B-1s and B-2s in anticipation of entering production of the new B-21 in the mid-2020s. The Air Force should rethink those baffling plans now that bombers are playing a larger role.Defense leaders recognize bombers as essential and vital to deal with great power competition in the Pacific, and with a growing threat from Russia and Iran. Bomber presence in the Western Pacific, Eastern Europe and the Middle East also reassures our allies in those regions ¡ª notably Japan, South Korea, NATO members and Israel ¡ª that U.S. bombers provide a visible expression of extended deterrence and a forceful reminder to our adversaries against any thoughts of aggression.B-2s and B-52s also create ambiguity in the minds of our adversaries, who do not know whether the aircraft are carrying conventional or nuclear weapons.With the debt burden our nation now carries, defense budgets will come under increased scrutiny. Bombers can maintain near-continuous presence globally at a small fraction of the cost of aircraft carrier battle groups, and they can provide more firepower. A single B-2 can carry and launch 80 precision-guided weapons, each to a different target, and penetrate contested airspace. B-1s and B-52s can carry and launch long-range, stealthy cruise missiles from ranges outside the threat rings. Individually or in combination, they can provide far more massive firepower than land or sea-based systems.. The Pentagon leadership must now recognize the savings in people, operating costs and increased survivability of the bomber fleets versus aircraft carrier battle groups, and shift priorities to match this reality.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe Air Force has already begun retiring 17 more B-1s, with plans to retire all B-1s and B-2s even before the B-21s are fielded in numbers. Retiring any more B-1s and B-2s should happen only as they are replaced, one for one, by new B-21s. That means continuing to retain and modernize them for 10 more years of service.Now is the time to upgrade the enduring value of the nation¡¯s bomber force and its immense contributions to global deterrence and combat actions.

"What is a legacy system? The key is relevance, not age.",,"Rows of F-4 Phantoms and T-38 Talons line the grounds of the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, also known as the ""Boneyard,"" at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. (Tech. Sgt. Bennie J. Davis III/U.S. Air Force)Two decades into the 21st century, far too much of the U.S. military consists of systems that were designed and initially produced at the end of the last century, and in many cases back to the late Cold War. While the United States and its allies face growing threats from China and Russia, much of the U.S. military force structure has been worn out by the relentless pace of global operations over the past two decades.As one example, the size of the U.S. Air Force¡¯s combat aircraft inventory is at an all-time low, while the age of key elements of the combat aircraft fleet is at an all-time high. An urgent need exists to upgrade U.S. military capabilities, that can no longer be addressed solely by modernizing existing platforms. At the same time, the massive price tag associated with the response to COVID-19, along with the pandemic¡¯s lingering impact on the U.S. economy, threatens to blow a hole in any future stability for the defense budget.The report of the House Armed Services Committee¡¯s Future of Defense Task Force argued that ¡°Congress and the Department of Defense must identify, replace, and retire costly and ineffective legacy platforms,¡± and conduct a ¡°tough and fulsome review of legacy systems, platforms, and missions¡± patterned loosely on the base realignment and closure process, or BRAC, of the 1990s. Successfully designing and conducting a BRAC for legacy systems requires a clear definition of what constitutes a legacy system. A platform¡¯s age and related maintenance costs may appear as straightforward criteria. Systems nearing the end of their service lives cost much more to maintain, so retiring them in favor of newer systems is pragmatic. However, the services¡¯ record here is decidedly mixed and inconsistent.One example is the U.S. Air Force¡¯s efforts to cut or eliminate unmanned air systems, such as the MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk, despite their organic kill chain capabilities and mission flexibility, while repeatedly delaying programs to replace the venerable B-52 Stratofortress, which is now envisioned to remain on duty through its centenary.Here are some of the upgrades coming to the US Air Force¡¯s oldest bomberHere are some of the upgrades coming to the US Air Force¡¯s oldest bomberNew radar, new weapons, new data links. Same old plane.By: Valerie InsinnaRather than focusing solely upon age, judging whether a system earns the ¡°legacy¡± moniker must center on its contribution to great power competition and potentially great power conflict, both immediately and in the near term. A multifaceted assessment of platform¡¯s contribution should consider:How adaptable is the platform to battle networks? How well can it host alternative payloads and perform alternative missions? How well can it absorb new software and technology, and at what effort and cost? Many platforms lack the space, weight, power and cooling to be able to accept new or upgraded functions.How well connected is the platform? How readily can it communicate and share data with other systems? Systems must be able to draw information from and provide information to as many other platforms as possible.Can the platform organically complete kill chains? How many different mission threads? If not, how much can it do independently rather than relying on support from other platforms?What is the history of readiness? At what effort and cost?Is the platform the sole capability for a mission, and how important is that mission? Can the mission be covered elsewhere in the near term, including by allies? What programs are there to cover this in the future?How interoperable is the platform, both with other U.S. systems and with allies? Have U.S. allies and partners also invested in the platform? What allies/partners might be interested in purchasing these divested platforms for their own forces, or as surplus equipment?How easy or difficult would it be to replace the platform? If more is needed, how easily, how quickly and at what cost can they be obtained? How healthy is the industrial base that supports it?So what should be done with legacy systems?Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeSome could be transferred out of operational status and used for experimentation. Historically, the 1950s and 1960s were a boon for Cold War military innovation precisely because of the amount of surplus World War II equipment that was available for experimentation without affecting operational forces. Other systems could be converted to unmanned variants and used for sorties as disposable platforms. Technology efforts have already enabled this approach for years, the QF-16 effort as one example among many.Still, other systems could be retired or decommissioned and transferred to key allies and partners through the Foreign Military Sales process. Many such platforms could meet the needs of allies and partners, especially during continuous competition and for operations in their own backyards. U.S. military planners can encourage allies and partners to shoulder a greater share of competition efforts while the U.S. focuses on readiness for conflict.Congress and the Defense Department need a sophisticated approach for thinking about legacy systems, one that focuses on relevance to contemporary competition and conflict.

"US Air Force eyes budget-conscious, clean-sheet fighter jet to replace the F-16",,"An F-16 Fighting Falcon assigned to the 480th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron lands at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates. (Senior Airman Bryan Guthrie/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force could be in the market for a brand-new, advanced, fourth-generation fighter jet as it looks to replace its oldest F-16s, the service¡¯s top general said Wednesday.The Air Force has started a study that will describe its preferred mix of fighters and other tactical aircraft that will be used to help build the fiscal year 2023 budget. That result could include a brand new ¡°four-and-a half or fifth-gen minus¡± fighter with capabilities that fall somewhere in between the 1970s era F-16 and stealthy fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 joint strike fighter, said Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles ¡°CQ¡± Brown.¡°If we have the capability to do something even more capable for cheaper and faster, why not? Let¡¯s not just buy off the shelf, let¡¯s actually take a look at something else out there that we can build,¡± Brown told reporters during a Defense Writers Group roundtable.Brown¡¯s comments are the first time an Air Force official has spoken about introducing another fourth-generation aircraft into the service¡¯s fighter inventory. In January, former Air Force acquisition chief Will Roper disclosed that the service¡¯s ongoing study will also weigh whether to buy new-build F-16s from Lockheed Martin.¡°As you look at the new F-16 production line in South Carolina, that system has some wonderful upgraded capabilities that are worth thinking about as part of our capacity solution,¡± Roper told Aviation Week.But Brown said he is still yet to be convinced that the F-16 is the right option.¡°I don¡¯t know that it actually would be the F-16. Actually, I want to be able to build something new and different that¡¯s not the F-16 ¡ª that has some of those capabilities, but gets there faster and features a digital approach,¡± he said. ¡°I realize that folks have alluded that it will be a particular airplane.

Both aircraft have been designed using digital engineering practices, which have allowed the service to model the lifecycle of various designs and rapidly get full-scale demonstrators ready for flight tests.¡°And so the question is, what is the son of NGAD?¡± he said.The ongoing study will include modeling, simulation and analysis aimed at nailing down the right mix of aircraft, what capabilities they each have and how many of each type are needed in order to ensure the Air Force can be successful in future conflicts.Although the Air Force is currently conducting the study without input from outside organizations, Brown said he would like to involve the Pentagon¡¯s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, an influential organization inside the Office of the Secretary of Defense that often pushes against service budget decisions and advocates lower-cost solutions.¡°I can make a recommendation, but I don¡¯t actually have the final vote because, again, I have to work with OSD and with the Congress. But that¡¯s why the analysis to me is important and a dialogue is important,¡± he said.Investing in another fighter type could be a hard sell for the Air Force to make to Congress, particularly with several fighters already in production.The Air Force has not officially deviated from plans to buy 1,763 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing jets from Lockheed over its program of record, although internal documents from the Air Force¡¯s future warfighting cell have indicated a plan to curb orders at 1,050 jets, Aviation Week reported in December.Last year, the service placed its first order for Boeing F-15EX jets to replacing aging F-15C/Ds, and could buy more than 144 of the new planes.

Forty-five B-1s will be left in the active-duty inventory after the 17 bombers are divested.The B-1B has been flown hard in combat over the last two decades, and continued operations over the Middle East have ¡°taken a toll on the airframe¡¯s structure,¡± the Air Force said in a statement. Currently, a small portion of the B-1B fleet would require anywhere from $10 million to $30 million per plane to maintain the ¡°status quo.¡±In the FY21 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress prohibited the Air Force from reassigning any maintenance personnel currently working on the B-1, ensuring that maintainers can devote their attention to increasing the readiness of the B-1 inventory.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribe¡°Retiring aircraft with the least amount of usable life allows us to prioritize the health of the fleet and crew training,¡± Ray said. ¡°Our ability to balance these priorities will make us more capable and lethal overall.¡±The last B-1 is slated to leave service in 2036.",,Valerie Insinna,2021/2/18,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/02/18/the-bone-heads-to-the-boneyard/

The service has encountered issues with securing more of the Russian-built Il-76s airlifters for conversion into tankers or to boost its modest heavy airlift capabilities prior to the Y-20 entering service in 2016.The small number of Il-78s in PLAAF service, as well as the limited fuel offload capability of the H-6 compared to larger aircraft, means China has what could be described as a modest inflight refueling capability.This shortfall in tanker capacity is likely to ease if more Y-20Us are built, and the increase in the number of these force multiplier aircraft will enable China to extend its reach in airspace and keep its combat aircraft in the air for longer periods of time.",,Mike Yeo,2021/2/18,https://www.defensenews.com/global/asia-pacific/2021/02/18/satellite-images-suggest-chinas-new-tanker-aircraft-is-under-production/
Swedish defense leaders push Saab¡¯s Gripen offer for Finland,,"A Swedish Gripen jet lands at Rovaniemi airport during joint exercises between the Finnish and Swedish air forces over the Arctic Circle on March 25, 2019. (Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP via Getty Images)COLOGNE, Germany ¡ª Top Swedish defense officials have thrown their weight behind Saab¡¯s bid for the multibillion-dollar HX fighter competition in Finland, arguing the Gripen aircraft would enable unprecedented cooperation between the two countries in thwarting a hypothetical attack by Russia.The Finnish race is one of two big-ticket aircraft competitions in Europe ¡ª Switzerland being the other ¡ª where major vendors from both sides of the Atlantic are jockeying for position. Finland has requested final offers by the end of April from Airbus for the Eurofighter; Dassault for the Rafale; Boeing for the Super Hornet; Lockheed Martin for the F-35; and Saab for the Gripen E/F.Helsinki has budgeted roughly $12 billion for the program.Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist said the aircraft competition comes during a ¡°deteriorating security situation¡± around the Baltic Sea, which he blamed on Russian military flexing. He framed greater defense cooperation among the Scandinavian countries as a prerequisite for standing up to Moscow¡¯s ¡°aggressive moves.¡±¡°Air defense is a vital part of this,¡± Hultqvist said during an online press conference on Feb. 16.Brig. Gen. Anders Persson, the Swedish deputy chief of the Air Force, zeroed in on Sweden and Finland as potential points of incursion for Russian forces. Adversarial airplanes could enter their airspace in large numbers, benefitting from the countries¡¯ long northeast orientation, he said.In such a case, the more exposed Finnish air fleet could fall back west on bases in neighboring Sweden, a feat that would be more easily accomplished if both countries had the Gripen, Persson argued.¡°We¡¯ll be like one air force with two commanders,¡± he said.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeSaab CEO Micael Johansson dangled the prospect of enhanced industrial cooperation with Finnish companies, especially because the customer would get a role in developing new features on the Gripen.¡°This aircraft has an architecture that makes it upgradeable in a very short time,¡± he said.Johansson also praised the capabilities of another aircraft: the GlobalEye early-warning and spy plane, which Saab is offering to Finland for the country¡¯s military modernization program. The aircraft¡¯s sensors would essentially nullify stealth features of attacking aircraft, he claimed.Warplane makers have been pulling out all the stops, often with help from their respective governments, to advertise their aircraft in the Finnish and Swiss competitions. Saab¡¯s Gripen offer was eliminated from the Swiss race in 2019 because the ¡°E¡± version of the plane wasn¡¯t fully ready for the Swiss government¡¯s flight demonstration regime at the time.However, Saab is still banking on international expansion led by a sale of the Gripen to Brazil, Johansson said.Norway, the westernmost neighbor on the Scandinavian peninsula, is upgrading its Air Force with F-35s.",,Sebastian Sprenger ,2021/2/17,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/02/17/swedish-defense-leaders-push-saabs-gripen-offer-for-finland/
Special ops still bullish on new armed overwatch plane,,"A U-28A Draco assigned to the 319th Special Operations Squadron is parked on the flightline at Hurlburt Field, Florida, Aug. 12, 2020. The Draco¡¯s mission is to provide manned fixed-wing tactical airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance support to humanitarian operations, search and rescue, conventional and special operations missions worldwide. (Airman 1st Class Blake Wiles/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Air Force Special Operations Command plans to conduct flying demonstrations of multiple armed overwatch aircraft this year, paving the way for procurement to start in fiscal 2022, its top general said Tuesday.Speaking at a discussion hosted by the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, AFSOC commander Lt. Gen. James Slife said that the forthcoming demonstration could help furnish lawmakers ¡ª who opposed funding the procurement of five armed overwatch planes in FY21 ¡ª with the information they need to satisfy questions and concerns about the program.¡°I think we can do [the program] at relatively low risk based on what we¡¯ve seen from the vendors who have indicated that they intend to bring platforms to demonstrate for us in the coming months,¡± Slife said. ¡°If it is non-developmental and it meets the requirements that SOCOM has laid out to industry, then we¡¯re interested in looking at it.¡±U.S. Special Operations Command requested $101 million in fiscal year 2021 to buy the first five armed overwatch aircraft and announced plans to purchase up to 75 planes total to replace the U-28 Draco. However, Congress made major cuts to the program and included language in the defense policy bill that would prohibit SOCOM from being able to buy armed overwatch aircraft in FY21.With the funding appropriated by Congress in FY21, SOCOM will be able to conduct a demonstration of off-the-shelf aircraft, said Slife, who added that he was not concerned that Congress would repeatedly seek to keep the program from moving forward.¡°I think Congress is appropriately and prudently exercising their oversight role. I would view this as a lower risk enterprise than perhaps some charged with oversight do, but the fact that we see it differently doesn¡¯t mean that they¡¯re wrong,¡± he said.¡°Ultimately I believe SOCOM will be able to demonstrate to the Congress that this is a viable program and it¡¯s required for the future operating environment. I remain cautiously optimistic.¡±AFSOC envisions its armed overwatch platform as a reconfigurable, multi-mission aircraft that will conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions and perform close air support of ground forces. The aircraft, which will be flown only in uncontested environments such as in Africa, will be able to operate in austere conditions using a very minimal logistics footprint.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribe¡°The whole reason we¡¯re doing this is because the national defense strategy talks about the need to do cost effective [counter-violent extremist organization] operations, cost effective irregular warfare,¡± Slife said. ¡°So the operating environment where we currently operate U-28s is about the same operating environment where we would envision operating armed overwatch platforms.¡±According to Air Force Magazine, at least four vendors have indicated an interest in the program: Sierra Nevada Corp., Textron Aviation, Air Tractor, and Leidos.Slife stressed that the armed overwatch program is not a ¡°rehash¡± of the Air Force¡¯s light attack experimentation campaign. During that effort, the Air Force tested multiple off-the-shelf attack planes ¡ª including some candidates that are vying to be included in the armed overwatch program, such as Textron and Sierra Nevada ¡ª in the hopes of discerning whether a buy of about 300 planes could help the service conduct counterterrorism operations more cost effectively.The Air Force ultimately abandoned the effort in its FY21 budget due to other spending priorities.Slife said it is too early to say whether SOCOM will consider buying multiple platforms, or whether it would be amenable to leasing aircraft or other alternatives to a traditional acquisition program. However, he stressed that the special operations community would not be transitioning to a fighter type aircraft with a jet engine and an ejection seat.¡°The armed overwatch platform will be less expensive to operate [than the U-28],¡± Slife said. ¡°It will be more versatile than the U-28, and frankly, we¡¯ll have greater capacity to operate in those small disaggregated kinds of teams.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2021/2/16,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/02/16/special-ops-still-bullish-on-new-armed-overwatch-plane/
An engine shortage is the newest problem to hit the F-35 enterprise,,"Members of the 380th Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron Air Terminal Operations Center wheel an F-35A Lightning II engine out of a C-17 Globemaster III aircraft, August 26, 2020, at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates. (Tech. Sgt. Charles Taylor/U.S. Air Force)Correction 2/12/2021 at 6:23 p.m. EST: In an earlier version of the story, a defense official gave an erroneous target for power module production. The story has been revised with the correct number.WASHINGTON ¡ª The F-35 joint strike fighter program is grappling with a shortage of the jet¡¯s Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, and it could be months before the situation starts to improve, a defense official said Friday.The problem, according to the F-35 joint program office, is twofold. First, the F135 Heavy Maintenance Center at Tinker Air Force Base, Okla., has not been able to process engines through scheduled depot maintenance as quickly as projected.Second, maintainers are discovering ¡°premature distress of rotor blade coatings¡± in a ¡°small number¡± of engine power modules, creating more repair work and contributing to the backlog.A defense official who spoke to Defense News on background called the issues a ¡°serious readiness problem.¡± By 2022, roughly 5 to 6 percent of the F-35 fleet could be without engines due to scheduled depot maintenance as well as unscheduled engine removals caused by F135s in need of repair.Leaders hope that corrective actions will keep the program from exceeding that threshold, but the defense official confirmed that as many as 20 percent of F-35s could be impacted by the engine shortage if those fixes do not work and no further action is taken.In January, Ellen Lord ¡ª then the Pentagon¡¯s top acquisition official ¡ª told reporters that the engine problems were one of the main maintenance issues found to degrade F-35 mission capable rates, which sat at 69 percent last month.As a result of the engine problems, the Air Force has cut eight performances from the F-35 demonstration team¡¯s 2021 schedule so as not to add onto the existing maintenance backlog, Bloomberg reported on Feb. 10.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeAccording to the F-35 program office, the Defense Department first noticed signs of the engine shortage issue in early 2020. At the end of the summer, the department received an update that made clear that the F135 depot would not be able to process 60 engine power modules a year, as was previously expected, the defense official said.Myriad factors contributed to the slowdown, including ¡°an increase in the work scope that they were seeing within as they tore down the engine, the unavailability of tech data, some of the engineering disposition wait time, the lack of available support equipment and ¡­depot workforce proficiency,¡± the official said.This was coupled with a ¡°higher preponderance¡± of degradation to the heat protective coating applied to the blades of the F135 power module.In order to tackle the maintenance backlog, the Air Force is adding a second shift at the F135 Heavy Maintenance Center, which should be up and running by June, the official said.The F-35 program office has already contracted with Pratt & Whitney for additional power module repair support, and its working with the contractor to obtain more training, support equipment and technical data.¡°What we want to shoot for is it turning out power modules at about 122 days. We¡¯re a little over 200 days today,¡± the official said.Pratt & Whitney, a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies, also introduced a hardware modification to engine blades in spring 2020 that is being incorporated in the production line and in engines going through sustainment, the company said in a statement.¡°We continue to work closely with the F-35 Joint Program Office, the services, and the Oklahoma City-Air Logistics Complex to increase enterprise capacity across the F135 Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul & Upgrade network,¡± the company said. ¡°P&W also recognizes the inherent challenges that the F135 program¡¯s sustainment strategy is presenting, and continues to collaborate with the JPO and services to align on solutions to meet their needs.¡±The Air Force is hosting a Feb. 17 summit at Tinker AFB where F-35 commanders will be able to discuss the program, including whether further short-term steps should be taken to ameliorate the F135 power module problem, but the defense official declined to detail what additional actions are possible.At the very least, good news is on the horizon for solving ongoing issues with F-35 canopies, a separate problem that Lord cited as another major driver of unscheduled maintenance.In 2019, the F-35 joint program office told Defense News that the problem revolves around transparency delamination, when the coatings of the canopy begin to peel from the base. When the issue occurs, the aircraft are temporarily taken out of service until its canopy is replaced.However, GKN Aerospace ¡ª which produces canopy transparencies for all F-35 variants ¡ª was struggling to produce enough canopies to meet demand, leaving dozens of aircraft on the flight line awaiting replacements.According to the defense official, there may be some relief to that problem in the near future. The program office recently added a second canopy manufacturer to the F-35¡äs supply chain: PPG Aerospace, which will begin producing F-35 canopy transparencies in May.",,Valerie Insinna,2021/2/12,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/02/12/an-engine-shortage-is-the-newest-problem-to-hit-the-f-35-enterprise/
The tiny tech lab that put AI on a spyplane has another secret project,,"A U-2 flies above the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, California, Mar. 23, 2016. (Staff Sgt. Robert M. Trujillo/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª It started as a dare.When Will Roper, then the Air Force¡¯s top acquisition official, visited Beale Air Force Base in California last fall, he issued a challenge to the U-2 Federal Laboratory, a five-person organization founded in October 2019. The team was established to create advanced technologies for the venerable Lockheed Martin U-2 spyplane, and Roper wanted to push the team further.¡°He walked into the laboratory and held his finger out and pointed directly at me,¡± recalled Maj. Ray Tierney, the U-2 pilot who founded and now leads the lab. ¡°He said, ¡®Ray, I got a challenge.¡¯ We didn¡¯t even say hello.¡±Roper, a string theorist turned reluctant government bureaucrat who was known for his disruptive style and seemingly endless references to science-fiction, wanted the team to update the U-2¡äs software during a flight. It was a feat the U.S. military had never accomplished, but to Tierney¡¯s exasperation, Roper wanted only to know how long it would take for the lab to pull off.The answer, it turns out, was two days and 22 hours.A month later, in mid-November, Roper laid out a second challenge: Create an AI copilot for the U-2, a collection of algorithms that would be able to learn and adapt in a way totally unlike the mindlessness of an autopilot that strictly follows a preplanned route.That task took a month, when an AI entity called Artu¦Ì (pronounced Artoo, as in R2-D2 of Star Wars fame) was given control of the U-2¡äs sensors and conveyed information about the location of adversary missile launchers to the human pilot during a live training flight on Dec. 15.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeNow, the U-2 Federal Laboratory is at work again on another undisclosed challenge. Tierney and Roper declined to elaborate on the task in interviews with Defense News. But Roper acknowledged, more broadly, that a future where AI copilots regularly fly with human operators was close at hand.¡°Artu¦Ì has a really good chance of making it into operations by maybe the summer of this year,¡± Roper told Defense News before his Jan. 20 departure from the service. ¡°I¡¯m working with the team on how aggressive is the Goldilocks of being aggressive enough? The goal is fairly achievable, but still requires a lot of stress and effort.¡±In order to ready Artu¦Ì for day-to-day operations, the AI entity will be tested in potentially millions of virtual training missions ¡ª including ones where it faces off against itself. The Air Force must also figure out how to certify it so that it can be used outside of a test environment, Roper said.¡°The first time we fly an AI in a real operation or real world mission ¡ª that¡¯s the next big flag to plant in the ground,¡± Roper said. ¡°And my goal before I leave is to provide the path, the technical objectives, the program approach that¡¯s necessary to get to that flag and milestone.¡±Meanwhile, the team has its own less formal, longer-term challenge: How do you prove to a giant organization like the Air Force, one that is full of bureaucracy and thorough reviews, that a small team of five people can quickly create the innovation the service needs?No regulations, no rulesDuring a Dec. 22 interview, Tierney made it clear that he had little interest in discussing what the U-2 Federal Lab is currently working on. What he wanted to promote, he said, was the concept of how federal laboratories could act as innovation pressure chambers for the military ¡ª a place where operators, scientists and acquisition personnel would have the freedom to create without being hamstrung by red tape.Gen. Mark Kelly, right, commander of Air Combat Command, and Command Chief Master Sgt.

David Wade of ACC receive a briefing from U-2 Federal Laboratory staff about the organization¡¯s stand-up and recent projects, Dec. 4, 2020, at Beale Air Force Base, Calif. (Staff Sgt. Colville McFee/U.S. Air Force)For those immersed in military technology, focusing on the promise of federal laboratories can seem like a bit of a letdown, if not outright academic, especially when compared to a discussion about the future of artificial intelligence. The U.S. government is rife with organizations ¡ª often named after tired Star Wars references that would make even the most enthusiastic fanboy cringe ¡ª created in the name of fostering innovation and rapidly developing new technologies. Many of those advances never make it over the ¡°valley of death¡± between when a technology is first designed and when it is finally mature enough to go into production.Ultimately, that¡¯s the problem the U-2 Federal Lab was created to solve.As a federally accredited laboratory, the team is empowered to create a technology, test it directly with users, mature it over time, and graduate it into the normal acquisition process at Milestone B, Tierney said. At that stage, the product is ready to be treated as a program of record going through the engineering and manufacturing development process, which directly precedes full-rate production.¡°We¡¯re basically front loading all the work so that when we hand it to the acquisition system, there¡¯s no work left to do,¡± Tierney said. The lab essentially functions as a ¡°blue ocean,¡± as an uncontested market that does not normally exist in the acquisition system, he explained. ¡°There¡¯s no regulations; there¡¯s no rules.¡±While that might sound similar to organizations the Air Force has started to harness emerging technologies, such as its Kessel Run software development factory, Tierney bristled at the comparison.¡°We¡¯re basically developing on the weapon system, and then working our way back through the lines of production, as opposed to a lot of these organizations like Kessel Run, which is developing it on servers and server environments,¡± he said.That distinction is critical when it comes to bringing modern software technologies to an aging platform like the U-2, an aircraft that took its first flight in 1955 and is so idiosyncratic that high speed muscle cars are needed to chase the spyplane and provide situational awareness as it lands.Because the team works only with the U-2, they understand the precise limitations of the weapon system, what its decades-old computers are capable of handling, and how to get the most out of the remaining space and power inside the airplane.Besides Tierney, there are only four other members of the U-2 Federal Lab: a National Guardsman with more than a decade of experience working for IBM, and three civilians with PhDs in machine learning, experimental astrophysics and applied mathematics. (The Air Force declined to provide the names of the other employees from the lab.)As the lone member of the team with experience flying the U-2, Tierney provides perspective on how the aircraft is used operationally and what types of technologies rank high on pilots¡¯ wish lists. But what most often drives the team are the projects that can make the biggest impact ¡ª not just for the U-2, but across the whole Defense Department.Making it workOne of those projects was an effort to use Kubernetes, a containerized system that allows users to automate the deployment and management of software applications, onboard a U-2. The technology was originally created by Google and is currently maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.¡°Essentially, what it does is it federates or distributes processing between a bunch of different computers. So you can take five computers in your house and basically mush them all together into one more powerful computer,¡± Tierney said.The idea generated some resistance from other members of the lab, who questioned the usefulness of deploying Kubernetes to the U-2¡äs simple computing system.¡°They said, ¡®Kubernetes is useless to us. It¡¯s a lot of extra processing overhead. We don¡¯t have enough containers. We have one processing board, [so] what are you distributing against? You got one computer,¡¯¡± Tierney said. But a successful demonstration, held in September, proved that it was possible for even a 1950s-era aircraft to run Kubernetes, opening the door for the Defense Department to think about how it could be used to give legacy platforms more computing power.Maj. ¡°Vudu¡±, a U-2 Dragon Lady pilot assigned to the 9th Reconnaissance Wing, prepares to taxi after returning from a training sortie at Beale Air Force, Calif., Dec. 15, 2020.

We didn¡¯t outsource any work, it was literally and organically done by a team of five. Could you imagine if we grew the lab by a factor of two or three or four, what that would look like?¡±The lab has also created a government-owned open software architecture for the U-2, a task that took about three months and involved no additional funding. Once completed, the team was able to integrate advanced machine learning algorithms developed by Sandia National Laboratories in less than 30 minutes.¡°That¡¯s my litmus test for open architecture,¡± Tierney said. ¡°Go to any provider that says I have open architecture, and just ask them two questions. How long is it going to take you to integrate your service? And how much is it going to cost? And if the answer isn¡¯t minutes and free, it¡¯s not quite as open as what people want.¡±The U-2 Federal Lab hopes to export the open architecture system to other military aircraft and is already in talks with several Air Force and Navy program offices on potential demonstrations.Could the Air Force create other federal laboratories to create specialized tech for other aircraft? The U-2 lab was designed from the outset to be franchisable, but Tierney acknowledged that much of the success of future organizations will rest in the composition of the team and the level of expertise of its members.¡°Can it scale? Absolutely. How does it scale is another question,¡± Tierney said. ¡°Do you have one of these for every weapon system? Do you have just a couple sprinkled throughout the government? Does it proliferate en masse? Those are all questions that I think, largely can be explored.¡±For now, it¡¯s unclear whether the Air Force will adopt this framework more widely. The accomplishments of the U-2 Federal Laboratory have been lauded by Air Force leaders such as Chief of Staff Gen. Charles ¡°CQ¡± Brown, who in December wrote on Twitter that the group ¡°continue[s] to push the seemingly impossible.¡±However, it remains to be seen whether the Biden administration will give the lab the champion it found in Roper, and continued pressure on the defense budget ¡ª and to retire older aircraft like the U-2 ¡ª could present greater adversity for the lab.But as for the other challenge, the one Tierney and Roper didn¡¯t want to discuss, Tierney offered only a wink as to what comes next:¡°What I can say is that the future is going to be an interesting one.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2021/2/11,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/02/11/the-tiny-tech-lab-that-put-ai-on-a-spyplane-has-another-secret-project/

According to an Air Force news release, the bombs were able to establish communication links with each other and detected an initial target ¡ª a GPS jammer.However, the munitions are designed with an autonomy module that allows them to respond to changes on the battlefield, and the bombs sighted two higher-priority targets, which had been determined by Air Force mission planners before the flight and programmed into the weapons¡¯ rules of engagement.Unfortunately, due to software issues, the swarm was unable to transmit guidance commands to the navigation system, and the weapons struck a fail-safe target location instead.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribe¡°We had uploaded an [operational flight plan] that couldn¡¯t accept updated flight profile information from the autonomous onboard processor. And so ultimately the initial flight profile that was in it is where it ended up,¡± Pringle explained. ¡°There was no update, and the flight never changed. But we have done the forensics on it, we¡¯ve corrected what needed to happen.¡±Despite the setbacks during the first test, the Golden Horde concept still shows promise, Pringle said.Next week, she intends to meet with Brig. Gen. Heath Collins, the Air Force¡¯s program executive for weapons, to discuss the future of the program and how to eventually turn the technology into a product that can be used operationally.¡°Gen. Collins and I have been reassessing what the overall, long-term scope is of this program and what the end deliverable will be,¡± Pringle said. ¡°A major component of that is building a digital architecture that will allow more testing of various kinds of collaborative technologies and building in some containerized solutions that could be more plug and play across weapons.

"With Biden¡¯s ¡®full support,¡¯ the Space Force is officially here to stay",,"Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David Thompson swears in the first four enlisted recruits to the Space Force at Military Entrance Processing Station-Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 20, 2020. (U.S. Defense Department)WASHINGTON ¡ª U.S. President Joe Biden will not seek to eliminate the Space Force and roll military space functions back into the Air Force, the White House confirmed Wednesday.White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters during a Feb. 3 briefing that the new service has the ¡°full support¡± of the Biden administration.¡°We¡¯re not revisiting the decision,¡± she said.The U.S. Space Force has been a notorious and controversial presence in U.S. politics since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump took on the new military branch as a pet project.Although the idea of a separate service for space originated in Congress and developed bipartisan support, Trump¡¯s involvement in its establishment ¡ª which included his campaign selling Space Force-branded merchandise and recommending that his wife, Melania Trump, design the uniforms ¡ª made it a pop culture punching bag, as exemplified by the Netflix comedy series ¡°Space Force.¡±Psaki was asked during a Tuesday press briefing whether the Biden administration would ultimately seek to abolish the new space service, which was formally signed into law in December 2019.¡°Wow, Space Force. It¡¯s the plane of today,¡± she said, referencing previous questions about the Air Force One¡¯s paint job.¡°It is an interesting question,¡± she added. ¡°I am happy to check with our Space Force point of contact. I¡¯m not sure who that is.

However, he remained displeased Psaki hadn¡¯t apologized and at her unfamiliarity with the branch and its creation by Congress, where it enjoys ¡°very bipartisan support,¡± Rogers added.¡°It¡¯s a very serious branch taking on a very serious national security threat, so her ignorance on the topic disturbed me, and then her flippant attitude disturbed me. But what more disturbed me was, today, after she had been informed that it was a serious branch of the military dealing with a serious threat, she couldn¡¯t bring herself to say: ¡®I made a mistake,¡¯ ¡± Rogers said. ¡°I was glad to see her acknowledge what I already knew, and the administration has said before ¡ª that is, they¡¯re fully supportive of the Space Force and [know] its worth.¡±Chief of Space Operations Gen. John ¡°Jay¡± Raymond told reporters during a Wednesday morning roundtable that he would ¡°welcome the opportunity¡± to speak to the Biden administration about the ongoing work of the Space Force, which includes tracking debris in space, running the nation¡¯s GPS constellation, and managing satellites that provide communications links and help identify ballistic missiles.¡°I¡¯m very proud of the guardians in the Space Force,¡± he said.¡± I see the value of this force each and every day, and I¡¯m happy to talk to anybody about the great work [it¡¯s doing].¡±For those who have been closely watching the universe of military space, the news of Biden¡¯s support for the Space Force will come as little surprise.Space experts ¡ª including Todd Harrison of the Center for Strategic and International Studies as well as Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation ¡ª told Defense News in January that the Biden administration will likely retain the Space Force.¡°At this point we have spent thousands and thousands of hours and years of effort to create this new bureaucracy in the hope that it will address these challenges,¡± Weeden said. ¡°At this point, we have no choice but to see that through.

Air Force study on future aerial refueling tanker could start in 2022,,"The Air Force's future aerial refueling tanker could be unmanned, like the Navy's MQ-25 Stingray currently under development by Boeing. (Boeing)WASHINGTON ¡ª The Air Force could begin to lay out its vision for a future aerial refueling tanker, previously known as KC-Z, as early as next year, the head of Air Mobility Command said Monday.The service intends to conduct an analysis of alternatives for an advanced aerial refueling aircraft in fiscal year 2022, AMC commander Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost said during a Defense Writers Group meeting with reporters. That study will help the Air Force determine precisely which capabilities a future tanker will need to to operate in more heavily contested battlefields against the threats posed by nations such as Russia and China.¡°We¡¯re thinking about the near peer [competition], and what we need for a near peer [competition],¡± she said.Key to that discussion is figuring out how much of the aerial refueling process can be performed without a human pilot or boom operator onboard the plane to fly it or give other aircraft gas.¡°Is going to be autonomous? Is it going to be pilot on the loop [or] pilot in the loop capability?¡± asked Van Ovost. ¡°Is it going to be small? Is it going to be large? What kind of [self protection] is it going to have? What kind of electromagnetic spectrum capabilities is it going to have to both protect itself and enhance the lethality of the Joint Force while it¡¯s out there?¡±In April, Will Roper, then the Air Force¡¯s top acquisition official, told reporters that an agreement with Boeing for a new and improved KC-46 vision system could pave the way for autonomous aerial refueling. The addition of 4K high-definition cameras, modern processors and LiDAR (light detecting and ranging) sensors would help the new system accumulate much of the data necessary for a computer to correctly calculate all the variables that need to be solved for safe aerial refueling.¡°All you have to do is take that data that tells the world inside the jet the reality of geometries between the airplane and the boom outside the jet. Once you have that, you simply need to translate it into algorithms that allow the tanker to tank itself,¡± Roper said then.The Air Force is not the only service interested in automated aerial refueling. The Navy is flight testing the MQ-25 Stingray aerial refueling drone ¡ª which, like the Air Force¡¯s new KC-46 tanker, is built by Boeing. The Navy eventually hopes to operate the MQ-25 onboard aircraft carriers, where it will be used to extend the range of fighter jets like the F-35C and F/A-18EF Super Hornet.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeVan Ovost acknowledged the Air Force is still years away from being able to hold a competition for the platform formerly known as KC-Z. After the Air Force completes its procurement of 179 KC-46s ¡ª which, if its current buy rate holds, will occur around the 2027 timeframe ¡ª the service will buy a non-developmental ¡°bridge tanker,¡± she said.That effort, which replaces the KC-Y program, will likely be a battle between Boeing and an Airbus-Lockheed Martin team, which joined forces in 2018 to market Airbus¡¯ A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport to the U.S. Air Force. Both teams are expected to offer upgraded versions of their current aerial refueling aircraft.Van Ovost did not say when that competition will begin.Along with tackling questions about its future tanker, the Air Force is also set to begin a business case analysis whether to pursue contracted aerial refueling to support U.S. military training and test activities across the contiguous United States.After holding a December 2019 industry day with interested vendors, Air Mobility Command conducted a study into the feasibility and affordability of commercial air refueling services and submitted a proposal to Air Force leadership.However, Air Force leaders want more information before making a final decision, and have asked for a comprehensive business case analysis that would finalize a requirement for all of the services¡¯ needs, Van Ovost said. The study would come up with options for various contracting models ¡ª which could include tankers that are leased to the government or contractor-owned and operated ¡ª as well as hammer out details on Federal Aviation Administration certification requirements.¡°We¡¯re working with headquarters Air Force to finalize the parameters for the study, and then likely will be contracting out that study,¡± Van Ovost said. ¡°And for expectation¡¯s sake, it does take a while. These kinds of business case analysis we have seen take 18 months, so we are going to put pen to paper and take a very close look at it.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2021/2/2,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/02/02/air-force-study-on-future-aerial-refueling-tanker-could-start-in-2022/

Companies seek end to haggling over FCAS rights with fresh offer this week,,"The full-scale jet fighter model of the Systeme de Combat Aerien Futur (SCAF), the French-German-Spanish new generation Future Combat Air System (FCAS), is presented during the 53rd International Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, on June 17, 2019. (Eric Piermont/AFP via Getty Images)COLOGNE, Germany ¨C Airbus and Dassault executives hope to finalize their offer for the next phase of the Future Combat Air System by the end of the week, putting to rest a dispute over the handling of intellectual property rights that has been simmering between partner nations Germany, France and Spain.At issue is whether countries participating in the development of mainland Europe¡¯s futuristic weapon system are free to use the technology to make adjustments of their own later on, said German Air Force Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Ingo Gerhartz.¡°It should be clear that if we¡¯re developing a European system, there can be no black boxes,¡± he said at an virtual press conference organized by German aerospace industry association BDLI. The term ¡°black box¡± refers to technology purchased as-is, with no means by customers to understand, replicate or modify it.¡°It must be possible to hand intellectual property rights from branch of industry to another so that it¡¯s possible for all partners to make their own developments in the future,¡± Gerhartz added.The tri-national FCAS program aims to replace the German Eurofighter and French Rafale fleets by 2040. As envisioned, it will consist of a next-generation manned jet and a series of drones, dubbed remote carriers, that can be tasked to work in concert on anything from reconnaissance to strike missions.Germany¡¯s Airbus and France¡¯s Dassault are the primary contractors for the program. As Europe¡¯s most ambitious weapons project ever, it is estimated to have a price tag in the hundreds of billions of euros. Spain is meant to be a full participant, with Indra as national lead, getting access to a third of the overall work share.Next up for the program is additional development work culminating in the presentation of a demonstrator aircraft and remote carriers by 2026 or 2027. Those could be simple, throw-away drones or more elaborate unmanned planes in the style of a ¡°loyal wingman¡± to the human pilot, said Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, at the same event.An agreement on intellectual property usage is needed both on the government and industry level before submitting an offer for the upcoming program stage. The idea is to find a compromise by Feb. 5, have the Berlin government submit the documentation to the Bundestag, Germany¡¯s parliament, for approval over the next few months, and get the green light to spend additional money before the summer break, Hoke said.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeWhile Airbus is used to sharing its intellectual property rights when selling to the German government, partner nations, France and Spain handle those occasions differently. ¡°I¡¯m confident that we can find a common solution,¡± Hoke said.Reinhard Brandl, a lawmaker of Bavaria¡¯s Christian Social Union who sits on the Bundestag¡¯s appropriations committee, said he shared the optimism but singled out IP rights as a continuing sticking point. ¡°We will look at the agreement very carefully,¡± he said. ¡°We don¡¯t want to see unfavorable concessions just for the sake of an agreement.¡±Brandl belongs to a faction of German lawmakers who fear that domestic companies could lose out in a cooperative program with France. That is especially the case, following that logic, because Airbus, as the German lead contractor, is partly French to begin with.The French, meanwhile, have at times become frustrated with Germany¡¯s piecemeal approval process for FCAS funding, a dynamic that could become even more pronounced if money gets tight as a result of the coronavirus crisis.Thomas Jarzombek, the point person for aerospace policy at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, said the program remains crucial for German industry, describing it as a recovery activity for companies post-COVID. ¡°It¡¯s become even more important than before,¡± he said.Brandl said he still worries about spending cuts in the future, especially during development, as the defense ministry may seek opportunities for more near-term fixes to lagging readiness rates across the force.

US Air Force has a fix for two major KC-46 problems,,"A F-16 flown by Maj Spencer Bell, 40th Flight Test Squadron test pilot, receives fuel from a KC-46 Pegasus, above, during a flutter mission at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., on Dec. 12, 2019. (Tech. Sgt. John Raven/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Two of the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker¡¯s major technical problems may be in the rearview mirror.The U.S. Air Force on Feb. 1 announced it closed one of the Boeing-made aircraft¡¯s six category 1 deficiencies ¡ª which indicate problems that impact operations or pose a safety risk ¡ª and downgraded another to the lesser category 2 status.The two issues both revolve around components for the KC-46¡äs Auxiliary Power Unit, or APU, which is manufactured by Honeywell. The first deficiency was logged after the Air Force documented APU duct clamps, which are located inside the tail of the aircraft, were becoming loose or cracking, Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost said during a roundtable with reporters.The second problem involves the APU drain mast, which Van Ovost characterized as ¡°a small metal piece that¡¯s outside of the back of the airplane¡± that was not properly welded and would come loose during flight.Ultimately, Boeing developed a new riveted duct clamp design similar to those used in the Boeing 777 fleet, the service said in a statement. After the Federal Aviation Administration certified the new part, the Air Force began retrofitting its KC-46s with the new duct clamps in October. Boeing has also started producing KC-46s with the new clamps on its line in Everett, Washington.¡°We worked with Boeing, they had an engineering fix, and they not only found the fix [and] tested it but about 70 percent of the fielded fleet have already been retrofitted, and the rest will be done very shortly,¡± Van Ovost said.The Air Force in a statement said that the issue is no longer driving aircraft downtime or additional maintenance, and Van Ovost added that she is confident the new clamps will solve the problem.Boeing has also come up with an improved version of the drain mast, which is currently going through testing.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribe¡°They are working through the retrofit option right now,¡± Van Ovost said. ¡°All of the airplanes that are flying right now and doing our testing, they all have that modification. And everything seems to be going well. So ¡­ our engineering team has authorized to take that one off the list.¡±The KC-46 has four remaining category 1 deficiencies: two involving the Remote Vision System that are expected to be resolved when a new version of the system is rolled out in 2023; a problem with the stiffness of the air refueling boom that keeps it from being able to refuel some of the planes in the service¡¯s inventory; and an issue with fuel leaks.Boeing is locked into paying for all technical problems that cause it to exceed the $4.9 billion ceiling on the firm, fixed-price contract it signed in 2011. Thus, the company is financially responsible for fixing all deficiencies except for the boom issue, which is a change in the Air Force¡¯s requirements. So far, Boeing has racked up more than $5 billion in charges.The Air Force intends to buy 179 KC-46s and has amassed 42 so far. However, because the KC-46 is unable to fly in an operational capacity due to the number of deficiencies, the Air Force has opted to slow the transition of aircrews from legacy tankers to the KC-46, and is only accepting two aircraft from Boeing per month.¡°It¡¯s not just about iron.

Is Russia¡¯s defense industry too busy to take on another fighter jet project?,,"Russian MiG-31BM fighters fly over Red Square in Moscow on May 7, 2019, during a rehearsal for a military parade. The MiG-41 is expected to replace the jets. (Alexander Nemenov/AFP via Getty Images)Correction: A previous version of this story erroneously cited an analyst¡¯s view on China¡¯s and India¡¯s interest in the MiG-41. The analyst believes it¡¯s unlikely either country would want to participate in the aircraft¡¯s development.MOSCOW ¡ª Rostec announced this week it has begun developing the MiG-41, a fifth-generation fighter jet set to replace Russia¡¯s MiG-31 jets currently in service. However, amid a number of other ongoing military aerospace projects, experts are questioning whether industry has the resources to produce the aircraft by its deadline of 2030.The MiG-31 fleet entered service in 1980 under the Soviet Armed Forces and was upgraded in 1990 to become the MiG-31BM. The MiG-41, originally developed by Rostec subsidiary United Aircraft Corporation, has long been expected to replace the aging jets. Work on the new aircraft started in 2010 with UAC¡¯s Mikoyan design bureau and Sokol aviation production plant, based in Nizhny Novgorod, about six hours¡¯ drive from Moscow.According to Russian news reports, the MiG-41 will be equipped with stealth technology, reach a speed of Mach 4-4.3, carry anti-satellite missiles, and be able to perform tasks in Arctic and near-space environments.If it enters service, the MiG-41 will be the country¡¯s second fifth-generation fighter after the Su-57, which was developed by UAC subsidiary Sukhoi Company and had its first flight test in 2010.The Su-57 crashed during a flight test in December 2019. The pilot has survived, leaving the plane on the catapult chair. Defense officials told the Vedomosti newspaper at that time that technical mishaps in the control system might have caused the accident. A governmental commission was founded to investigate the accident, but no public report was realized.That same year, the Russian military bought 76 Su-57 planes. The cost of a single Su-57 might be about 3 billion roubles (U.S. $40 million), Izvestia reported that year, citing defense sources. The plane is equipped with the AL-41F1 engine, which is also used on the Su-35 jet. However, the local Lyulka Design Bureau is currently developing a new engine for the Su-57.According to Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the primary focus of Russia¡¯s defense industry is to develop that engine. That main effort takes away much-needed resources for the new plane, he explained.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeA London-based analyst echoed Pukhov¡¯s concerns, expressing skepticism that Russia ¡°will be able to develop, manufacture and introduce into service [the jet] in anything like the purported time frame.¡±Douglas Barrie, who focuses military aerospace for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Russia¡¯s aerospace sector is already committed to numerous projects, including further developing the Su-75, upgrading the Su-34, and modernizing various bombers such as the Tu-160 Blackjack, Tu-22M Backfire and Tu-95.¡°Some would argue that the sector has already more than enough to try to manage without the additional or a project potentially as complex as a new heavy interceptor, or indeed whether there would be realistic levels of funding for a program,¡± he said.Defense News contacted the Russian Aircraft Corporation, a subsidiary of UAC involved in the MiG-41 project, but the firm declined to comment on the jet¡¯s development.For his part, Pukhov thinks the government should ditch its costly projects and instead appropriate funds to develop drones. ¡°This is the sphere where Russia is still behind,¡± he said.He added that it¡¯s unlikely either China or India will want to cooperate on the MiG-41. The latter left a joint project to develop a fifth-generation fighter aircraft based on the Su-57 in 2018.Barrie also questioned the export potential of the MiG-41, saying the number of similar jets being built elsewhere is rapidly growing.¡°Even if such an aircraft were eventually to be developed, it would ¡ª were it to meet the same role as the MiG-31BM Foxhound C ¡ª have a very limited export appeal.¡±",,Alexander Bratersky,2021/1/29,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/01/29/is-russias-defense-industry-too-busy-to-take-on-another-fighter-jet-project/
Boeing¡¯s cost overruns on KC-46 now exceed initial contract with US Air Force,,"Capt. Wade Gallup, 7th Airlift Squadron pilot, approaches a KC-46 Pegasus during refueling training over central Washington state on Jan. 30, 2019. (Airman 1st Class Sara Hoerichs/U.S. Air Force)Edited on 1/27/21 at 1:44 p.m. to provide more details on the cost overrun.WASHINGTON ¡ª With the Jan. 27 announcement of a new $275 million charge on the KC-46, Boeing has now paid as much in cost overruns for the troubled program as the U.S. Air Force invested in the tanker¡¯s development.The new charge, which the company reported as part of fourth-quarter 2020 earnings, means Boeing has now paid more than $5.0 billion out of pocket to pay for the myriad technical problems and production issues that have cropped up since the company won the program in 2011. Under the firm, fixed-price contract signed then, Boeing is responsible for paying for any costs in excess of the contract¡¯s $4.9 billion ceiling.The latest KC-46 overrun occurred ¡°primarily due to production inefficiencies including impacts of COVID-19 disruption,¡± the company said.Steve Trimble of Aviation Week put together a list of KC-46 charges by year, finding that the program documented its largest overrun in 2020 despite seeing charges decrease to only $148 million in 2019.The company previously attributed $494 million in charges to the ongoing pandemic during the first, second and third quarters of 2020.The KC-46 is a commercial-derivative plane based on the Boeing 767 airliner. Because it is manufactured on the 767 production line in Everett, Washington, before undergoing military-specific upgrades, any slowdown in commercial plane volume also makes it more expensive to produce the KC-46.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeBoeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun said in October he believed the KC-46 had moved past the technical problems that plagued the program over the past few years, and the tanker would prove to be an asset for the company after the pandemic had run its course.¡°The tanker has been a drag on us for three or four years in every way you can think of with respect to investors,¡± he said at the time. ¡°But we are continuing to clear the hurdle with our customers with respect to its performance in their fleet and their need for that tanker.¡°That whole relationship, I believe, will begin to transition next year, and opposed to being a drag on our franchise ¡ª which it¡¯s been ¡ª I believe it will become a strength in our franchise.¡±In an message to Boeing employees on Wednesday, Calhoun pointed to some key wins in the defense and space sector, including the first flight of the MQ-25 tanker drone with an aerial refueling store, and the demonstration of the F/A-18 Super Hornet¡¯s ski jump launch capability for the Indian Navy.Over the past month, Boeing has inked contracts with the U.S. Air Force for the sixth and seventh lots of KC-46 production, raking in $3.8 billion for an additional 27 tankers.However, during the earnings call, Calhoun noted that analysts should not count on Boeing¡¯s defense business to generate a massive amount of near-term growth in the wake of the pandemic.¡°We continue to believe that we¡¯re going to have stable growth, admittedly at the lower end of the single digits. That¡¯s the best guidance that we can talk about because we do believe there is pressure that will ultimately come down as a result of all of the COVID spending here in the United States,¡± he said.¡°But a large part of our business now is international market, and the order activity in those international markets is pushed to the right somewhat ¡ª and almost entirely because of COVID-related stuff,¡± he said. ¡°We still like our position because we have a lot of ongoing programs that the military and of course our defense [spending] bills have been kind to.¡±The Air Force plans to buy 179 KC-46 aircraft over the program of record.

"With new Air Force One planes still bare, Biden will choose between the jet¡¯s classic livery or a fresh paint scheme",,"A mockup of former President Donald Trump's preferred livery for the VC-25B was on display during a June 20, 2019 meeting between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)WASHINGTON ¡ª One of the first queries posed to President Joe Biden¡¯s new administration was whether the president would seek to undo a controversial change to the iconic Air Force One paint scheme proposed by his predecessor, Donald Trump.For now, it¡¯s a question that the White House has no intention of answering.¡°I can confirm for you here the president has not spent a moment thinking about the color scheme of Air Force One,¡± White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during a press conference Friday. Psaki was first asked about the Air Force One¡¯s paint scheme shortly after Biden¡¯s inauguration on Jan. 20.Biden¡¯s ambivalence about the redesign of Air Force One is a sharp contrast to Trump, who made himself a notoriously visible character in the saga of the Air Force¡¯s presidential aircraft recapitalization program.After his election in 2016, Trump called for the program to be canceled due to high costs. He softened after meetings with Boeing executives, and in 2018 announced that the two new VC-25Bs ¡ª designated Air Force One when carrying the president ¡ª would be painted red, white and blue instead of the iconic blue and white scheme chosen by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy in the 1960s.¡°I said, ¡®I wonder if we should use the same baby blue colors?¡¯ And we¡¯re not,¡± Trump said during a 2018 interview on CBS News. ¡°It¡¯s going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it¡¯s going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.¡±So far, the Biden administration has not directed the Air Force to explore alternative livery designs for the new Air Force One planes, nor have officials indicated a plan to revert back to the Kennedy-era paint scheme, an Air Force spokeswoman said in response to questions from Defense News.However, that¡¯s also not a decision the Biden administration will have to make in the immediate future.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeAircraft paint and interiors are included within the $3.9 billion firm, fixed-price contract that Boeing and the Air Force agreed to in July 2018, the Air Force stated. Every year, a portion of that funding is doled out to Boeing as it makes progress on the development and build of the two VC-25Bs.Boeing is still in the process of making major hardware modifications to the two Boeing 747-8 airliners that will become VC-25Bs ¡ª including adding power upgrades, a medical facility, and various other classified technologies needed to transform a commercial plane into a flying fortress.The new Air Force One planes aren¡¯t slated to be ready for operations until 2024. That gives the new administration time to determine a final paint scheme for the VC-25B and deliver its decision to Boeing, which will then begin painting the aircraft.¡°The Air Force coordinates appearance options for VC-25B external paint livery and interiors with the White House Military Office. The Air Force will not speculate on VC-25B decisions to be made by the new administration or potential costs associated with unknown future decisions,¡± a service spokeswoman said, adding that ¡°the Air Force is prepared for discussions with the new administration about the VC-25B program.¡±Another source with knowledge of the program clarified further that the paint for the plane has not been ordered, as the Air Force has not provided contractual guidance to Boeing on a final livery design.During a roundtable with reporters Jan. 19, Ellen Lord, who served as the Pentagon¡¯s top acquisition official during the Trump administration, downplayed the impact Trump had on the Air Force One replacement program.¡°The president had a lot of interest on a few programs. I don¡¯t think he influenced the programmatics,¡± Lord said. ¡°What he was interested in was the presidential aircraft. I was in the Oval for a meeting on that. But he, frankly, was focused on performance and the look of the aircraft, the color scheme and so forth.¡±The Air Force estimates that it will spend a total of $5.3 billion on the Air Force One replacement program.

Parly said, ¡°The quality of the cooperation between France and Greece is particularly visible in the Mediterranean,¡± where both countries have undertaken bilateral and multilateral exercises over the past few months. ¡°This cooperation [¡­.] is essential to ensure the security of the European continent, to ensure that the law and the freedom to circulate are respected,¡± she added.According to Greek media reports Parly was also expected to discuss the sale of Belharra frigates, made by France¡¯s Naval Group, as the export version of the FDI medium-sized frigates built for the French Navy.",,Christina Mackenzie,2021/1/25,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/01/25/greece-and-france-ink-3-billion-contract-for-rafale-fighter-jets/
British shell out seed funding for ¡®loyal wingman¡¯ combat drone,,"Computer-generated image of the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft (LANCA) concept flying alongside an F-35B. (British MOD image)LONDON ¡ª A British initiative to develop an unmanned air vehicle known as a ¡°loyal wingman¡± has received a boost with the announcement by the Ministry of Defence that a Spirit AeroSystems-led consortium is to build a full-scale test vehicle.The Belfast, Northern Ireland-based arm of Spirit and partners, including Northrop Grumman UK, have been awarded a ?30 million (U.S. $41 million) deal to lead a partnership, known as Team Mosquito, for building the demonstrator vehicle in time to start a test flight program by the end of 2023.Work maturing the Lightweight Affordable Novel Combat Aircraft, or LANCA, will run for three years until the conclusion of the flight trials, an MoD official said.Following completion of the demonstration phase, the Royal Air Force will analyze the data and use it to inform capability decisions, said the official.The unmanned vehicle is part of the air force¡¯s push to produce a low-cost machine in a fraction of the time of normal combat jets.The Spirit Mosquito team, previously known as Blackdawn and led by Callen-Lenz , secured the deal beating out proposals from partnerships led by Boeing and Blue Bear Systems.Spirit acquired the Belfast-based aerostructures operations of Canadian commercial and business jet builder Bombardier last year.Designing and building the airframe is a small but significant win for the company, which centers on building structures for the Airbus A220 airliner and other civil sector work.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeNorthrop Grumman UK, the key partner alongside Spirit in Team Mosquito, said in a statement it will be providing model-based systems engineering and agile engineering expertise.The company said it will also integrate its advanced mission management (AMM) and airborne communication node technologies to enable seamless human-machine collaboration and cooperative mission management across distributed manned and unmanned assets.The MoD said further companies in the new team will be announced later.Work on LANCA has been underway since 2015, with the MoD¡¯s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory taking the lead pursing innovative combat air technologies and concepts that offer radical reductions in cost and development time.Defense Ministry officials previously said they want to produce a drone for 10 percent of the cost and in one-fifth of the time of a combat jet.¡°If successful, Project Mosquito¡¯s findings could lead to the capability being deployed alongside RAF Typhoon and F-35 Lightning jets by the end of the decade,¡± said the MoD.The drone is now a RAF Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO)-led project under the Future Combat Air System Technology Initiative (FCAS TI).If the project is successful the Mosquito loyal wingman platform could eventually become the first unmanned platform in British service able to target and shoot down enemy aircraft.The Mosquito effort is one of several future air combat initiatives being pursued by the British, including development of swarming drones and the Tempest next-generation manned and unmanned combat jet.Air Chief Marshal Mike Wigston said the British were ¡°taking a revolutionary approach, looking at a game-changing mix of swarming drones and uncrewed fighter aircraft like Mosquito, alongside piloted fighters like Tempest, that will transform the combat battlespace in a way not seen since the advent of the jet age.¡±The loyal wingman concept is generating increasing interest with militaries across the world, with similar work underway in the United States, Australia and Europe.",,Andrew Chuter ,2021/1/25,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2021/01/25/british-shell-out-seed-funding-for-loyal-wingman-combat-drone/

(Senior Airman Keith Holcomb/U.S. Air Force)Correction: A previous version of this commentary miscalculated the number of operational F-35C squadrons with the U.S. Navy. The service has one.On Jan. 1, Congress overrode then-President Donald Trump¡¯s veto of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. Much of the news was about the vote itself, but another important story is the 93 F-35 fighter jets that were included in the bill ¡ª 14 more than the Pentagon requested in its budget.Congress recognizes that the F-35 is the cornerstone of deterrence in the great power competition that we face as a country. The 2018 National Defense Strategy acknowledged that ¡°inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security. ... Long- term strategic competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the [Defense] Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security and prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase in the future.¡±One of the top three defense objectives is ¡°deterring adversaries from aggression against our enemies.¡± The F-35 is the linchpin deterrent capability. Since the first two hours of Operation Desert Storm, we have enjoyed the luxury of maintaining air superiority, if not air supremacy. That will not be the case in any conflict with Russia or China. In fact, it would not even be the case in a conflict with Syria with the S-400 air defense capabilities.It is easy to forget: there is no guarantee we will continue to enjoy the luxury of operating in a permissive environment as we have throughout the last 20 years. We should not forget the costs we endure without it. In Vietnam 2,561 fixed-wing aircraft were lost. In the most recent conflict with contested airspace, Operation Allied Force in Kosovo in 1999, the only aircraft permitted to fly deeply into Serbia were B-2s and F-117s supported by American EA-6B Prowlers and F-16CJ suppression-of-air-defense aircraft. I remember because I flew in that conflict, and I have vivid memories of the night an F-117 was shot down by Serbian air defenses.Today, only 17 percent of the U.S. Air Force¡¯s bomber and fighter inventory consists of stealth aircraft that are capable of maneuvering freely in contested areas created by modern surface-to-air and air-to-air threats. The Navy has only one operational F-35C squadron, and the Marine Corps has five operational F-35 squadrons (four which fly the F-35B and one which flies the F-35C). The Air Force has five operational F-35A squadrons. This is but a modest deterrent capability.As Dr. Thomas Schelling noted in his seminal work, ¡°Arms and Influence,¡± ¡°the power to hurt is bargaining power. To exploit it is diplomacy, vicious diplomacy, but diplomacy.¡±Deterrence relies on the credibility of your threat. Today we do not possess the robust capability that our adversaries know would be able to impose massive damage on the first day of a conflict and then generate sorties at a rate to continue that effort. We can make our threats sincerely, but without a capability to back them up, they¡¯re not credible.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeBeyond the need for stealth aircraft to operate in a contested environment, the services are struggling to maintain the readiness of an aging fleet of aircraft. A Government Accountability Office report published in November 2020 examined 46 different types of aircraft in the inventory and found that only three met their annual mission-capable goals in the majority of years from 2011 through 2019, and 24 did not meet their annual mission-capable goals in any fiscal year.On top of these readiness challenges, we are still faced with a capacity shortfall. We have gone from an Air Force that in 1987 had 4,468 fighter aircraft and 331 bomber aircraft to one that has 1,481 fighter aircraft and 122 bomber aircraft. Part of the solution to that is the acquisition of the F-15EX, an advanced version of the F-15E. Current plans call for acquiring 144 aircraft at a cost of $87.7 million per jet. But that is an expensive Band-Aid, particularly when one must factor in that it actually sacrifices capability: The F-15EX cannot survive in an integrated, anti-access environment.The challenge is to get enough F-35 shadows on the flight lines to have an operational capability that is a credible deterrent. Congress and the new administration should consider accelerating production, even if it means doing less in other areas of military spending ¡ª yes, including counterterrorism.We must do more than pay lip service to the stated priority of restoring our competitive edge by blocking Russia and China from challenging us and our allies. In the 1980s, we stationed more than 350,000 American troops in Europe as a capable and effective deterrent. Fortunately, none of those troops saw combat.

"As 5G auction continues, Pentagon turns to safety planning",,"Two U.S. C-130J Super Hercules aircraft and a Bulgarian C-27J Spartan aircraft fly low-level formation flights in Bulgaria, Aug. 17, 2020. 5G deployment could pose an additional risk for low-level flight like this. (Tech. Sgt. Devin Nothstine/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The Defense Department will focus on preventing interference to aviation instruments rather than trying to stop the Federal Communications Commission from auctioning C-band spectrum used for 5G communication, officials tell Defense News.The Pentagon¡¯s decision comes despite industry¡¯s concerns about the functionality of a key aviation technology, which led to a Dec. 1 memo from the head of the Federal Aviation Administration and the number two at the Department of Transportation requesting the FCC pause the sale. The letter was sent after an aviation trade group found that 5G operations could cause harmful interference to radar altimeters, which are used by civil, military and commercial airplanes and helicopters to measure the distance between the aircraft and the ground.But rather than push back at the FCC, Pentagon officials believe their energies are best spent focused on studying how the deployment of 5G networks throughout U.S. metropolitan areas will impact military aircraft and putting in place a strategy to mitigate any safety concerns, said Alan Burke, the Pentagon¡¯s chair for the interagency Aviation Cyber Initiative Task Force.¡°The approach should be not on trying to slow down 5G metro deployment, but speeding up development and testing of mitigations that can serve as an interim gap until avionics manufacturers can harden their systems,¡± Burke said during a Jan. 7 interview.The military is scrambling to understand the aviation crash risk from a new 5G saleThe military is scrambling to understand the aviation crash risk from a new 5G saleMore than a dozen commercial aviation groups are warning that the sale of spectrum could lead to interference and even fatalities.By: Valerie Insinna and Aaron Mehta¡°The longer-term challenge is going to be making ¡ª not just radar altimeters ¡ª but avionics systems that are resilient to out-of-band interference, understanding what that interference is and what mitigations are required.¡±As part of the Trump administration¡¯s 5G FAST Plan, the FCC hopes to sell more than 5,000 new flexible-use overlay licenses for C-band spectrum in the 3.7¨C3.98 GHz frequency. The first phase of the auction, which ran from Dec. 8 to Jan. 15, received bids totaling $80.9 billion and has been billed as the highest-grossing auction of its kind in U.S. history.¡°The FCC confronted a host of technical, legal, practical, and political challenges in structuring this auction,¡± outgoing FCC chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. ¡°It would have been easy to delay. But we rightly pushed ahead and overcame every one of those obstacles. As a result, we significantly advanced United States leadership in 5G and have enabled America¡¯s wireless consumers to more quickly benefit from 5G services.¡±Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeBut testing has shown that 5G activities in the 3.7-3.98 portion of the band could create ¡°harmful interference¡± for radar altimeters, which operate in the neighboring 4.2-4.4 GHz portion of the band, according to an October study by RTCA, a trade organization that works with the FAA to develop safety standards.Although RTCA looked only at radar altimeters on commercial and civil aircraft, military aircraft altimeters operate on the same part of the spectrum and could be similarly vulnerable to interference, Burke said.Defense Department officials including Burke met with leaders from the FAA, Department of Homeland Security and other stakeholder agencies on Dec. 21 to discuss the issue.During the meeting, defense officials said representatives from Honeywell ¡ª a top supplier of radar altimeters and one of the companies who conducted research for the RTCA report ¡ª presented their findings and recommended that further testing be done for military radar altimeters. Honeywell declined to comment for this story.The immediate problem, Burke said, is that the Defense Department does not yet have a test range capable of evaluating how 5G telecommunications impact military-specific avionic equipment like radar altimeters.¡°We¡¯re working to establish a collaborative interagency approach,¡± Burke said. ¡°And that includes [establishing] a national 5G operational test range. If we wanted to do operational testing of our radar altimeters in a 5G C band environment, we don¡¯t have the capability to do that right now. And so that¡¯s a shortfall that we want to work to address.¡±The Pentagon sees that testing as an important bargaining chip for future discussions with the FCC, which has rejected the findings of the RTCA study as being overly stringent and not representative of operational scenarios.¡°If we want to improve on our ability to negotiate with the FCC, we have to back it up with facts ¡ª facts based on operational testing.

(NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images)The road aheadSeveral organizations are already building 5G test capabilities that could allow the Pentagon to do some level of assessment, including Hill Air Force Base in Utah, Idaho National Laboratory and the University of Utah.Defense Department leaders hope to work with officials across the government to ¡°identify what effort has the best chance of success¡± of supporting operational testing. The department would then have to divert funding to speed up the establishment of the range to and to conduct test activities, with the hope of completing an initial assessment in 12 to 18 months, Burke said.Military aviation officials have told Defense News that the operations of cargo planes and aerial refueling tankers would be the most impacted by 5G interference. Certain mobility planes are approved to make landings during ¡°instrument landing conditions,¡± or weather scenarios where there is poor visibility and a pilot has to rely on instruments like the radar altimeter instead of visual cues.But if an aircraft¡¯s altimeter is not working due to interference, that pilot would likely have to land elsewhere.Most military radar altimeters have built-in protections for high powered microwave and high intensity radiation frequencies, but right now the aviation community does not understand whether those defenses might safeguard against 5G interference, Burke said.Once the department understands the operational impact of 5G on its aircraft, it may have to take steps to address aviation safety concerns.Currently, the Pentagon is not discussing the wholesale replacement of its radar altimeters or the movement of devices to another portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, said Burke and Col. Ken Miller, who commands the Air Force Spectrum Management Office.Instead, the department is looking at options such as designating ¡°airfield operational exclusion zones¡± that block out 5G interference near airports in metropolitan areas, where interference would be the most dense and potentially harmful.Another mitigation approach is the use of filters to harden radar altimeters against interference.¡°Radar altimeters already have certain filters on them,¡± Burke said. ¡°It¡¯s unknown how effective they would be at filtering this interference. We haven¡¯t really gone too far down the technical lane here, but we do know that those kind of things are possible.¡±However, another senior government official pointed out that such measures could reduce the accuracy of the altimeter.¡°If you have a very high precision radar altimeter that¡¯s looking at a very wide bandwidth and has no filter, and you¡¯ve got to add a filter, that adds size, weight [and] power requirements and reduces performance,¡± the source said.Further out, the Defense Department will likely need to introduce new industrial standards so that future radar altimeter designs are more tolerant of interference that occurs due to devices operating on a neighboring portion of the electromagnetic spectrum ¡ª a situation that is becoming more prevalent with the rise of 5G.¡°The paradigm in general is we test the devices to make sure that they¡¯re transmitting in their assigned bands and operating in their assigned bands. What we normally haven¡¯t been testing for is what we call out-of-band interference,¡± Burke said.¡°People are going to have to adapt to that. On the spectrum highway, we want to be able to use all the lanes, and people can¡¯t be bandwidth hogs because of their device designs. They¡¯re going to have to relook at the design of devices to be more spectrum resilient.¡±",,Valerie Insinna and Aaron Mehta,2021/1/21,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/01/21/as-5g-auction-continues-pentagon-turns-to-safety-risk-mitigation-plans/

(Master Sgt. Patrick OReilly/Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The F-35 joint strike fighter is still struggling to meet its mission capable rate goals, with current figures well below the military¡¯s target, the Pentagon¡¯s outgoing acquisition chief told reporters on Jan. 19.The Lockheed Martin-made F-35¡äs mission capable rate ¡ª which describes the percentage of aircraft that can meet at least one of its assigned missions ¡ª currently sits at 69 percent, falling short of the military¡¯s longstanding 80 percent goal, said Ellen Lord, whose time as the undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment ended Jan. 20 at noon after Joe Biden was inaugurated as president.When looking at fully mission capable aircraft able to perform all of the F-35¡äs assigned missions, ¡°we¡¯re currently at 36 percent fully mission capable, and we are striving to be at 50 percent for the fleet,¡± she added.Lord attributed the low percentage of fully mission capable jets to ongoing issues with the F-35¡äs canopy and the F135 engine¡¯s power module.Although she did not elaborate, the program has grappled with a longstanding problem with ¡°transparency delamination,¡± where outer layers of the canopy begin to peel away from the base. In 2019, an F-35 joint program office spokesman told Defense News that the department was working with canopy supplier GKN Aerospace to improve the design and increase the supply of canopy transparencies.Although the F-35¡äs mission capable rate has improved in recent years, the latest figures presented by Lord show that progress be stagnating.In testimony to the House Oversight and Reform Committee in July, Lord noted that the mission capable rate for the F-35 increased from about 60 percent in January 2020 to nearly 70 percent in June of that year. Full mission capable rates improved from below 40 percent to nearly 50 percent over the same time period, she wrote.A similar jump had been documented in Lord¡¯s testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in November 2019, where she wrote that mission capable rates for combat-coded squadrons had increased from 55 percent in October 2018 to 73 percent in September 2019.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeIt¡¯s not always easy to chart the trajectory of whether the F-35¡äs readiness is improving due to a host of factors.Although Pentagon officials like Lord have, at times, provided updates about the jet¡¯s mission capable rates, it is often unclear whether the numbers cited reflect a single point in time ¡ª an especially good month where more F-35s are ready to fly, for example ¡ª or a sustained trend. Officials also sometimes talk specifically about ¡°operational¡± or ¡°combat-coded¡± squadrons, which leaves out a lot of the early model F-35s used by training and test squadrons, which are more prone to breaking down and needing repairs.Other times, the department has made mission capable rate data inaccessible to the public. In a November report on aircraft readiness, the Government Accountability Office reported that mission capable rates of all three F-35 variants had been moving upwards since fiscal 2018, but did not provide specific figures because the Defense Department designated such information as sensitive.Between fiscal years 2012 through 2019, the F-35A was able to meet mission capable rate goals in two years, the GAO reported. The F-35B hit its objective in only one year from fiscal 2013 to 2019, and the F-35C met its target two years over the same period.The GAO noted that spare parts shortages had contributed to the F-35 not being able to meet readiness objectives.¡°Specifically, the F-35 supply chain does not have enough spare parts available to keep aircraft flying enough of the time necessary to meet warfighter requirements,¡± the GAO stated. ¡°Several factors contributed to these parts shortages, including F-35 parts breaking more often than expected, and DOD¡¯s limited capability to repair parts when they break.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2021/1/20,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/01/20/the-defense-department-still-isnt-meeting-its-f-35-readiness-goals/

The forecast is 40 percent higher (or $50 billion more) than the 2017 budget submission estimations covering 2017 through 2026.CBO compared the two because 2017 was likely the last budget submission before the MDR influenced funding decisions and program plans, according to the report.The agency cautions that its estimate comes ¡°with substantial uncertainty because of uncertainty in some missile defense plans and in the future quantity and capabilities of adversaries¡¯ missile fleets, which could affect those defense plans.¡±Additionally, the MDR still left many unanswered questions requiring additional studies, some of which have not been disclosed or remain incomplete.And while the Trump administration conducted the MDR, a new administration under President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office Jan. 20, is likely to take an entirely fresh look at a missile defense strategy.To make formulating an estimate even more difficult, the FY20 budget did not contain some recommendations proposed in the MDR, so CBO estimated the costs of the recommendations even though there is not yet a budget for some elements.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe Missile Defense Review wanted to look at the possibility of increasing the number of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense batteries.

The NGI program has yet to choose two competitors to develop a new interceptor to replace what is currently in the ground (the program to redesign the kill vehicle on the current interceptor was canceled).A second GMD site with 20 interceptor silos would cost $4 billion to build and $80 million a year to operate.

MDA looked at something similar in 2004 as well.Other considerations that might alter the estimate are potentially lower costs to build and launch satellites, which could bring the estimate down by 20-30 percent, CBO found.Congress, in its FY21 spending bill last month, has already injected $1.3 billion into the Missile Defense Agency¡¯s budget, citing a disconnect between the agency¡¯s request and what it would need to meet National Defense Strategy goals.The FY21 MDA budget request for $9.13 billion is a decrease of $1.27 billion over the previous year¡¯s enacted top line.

(U.S. Army)WASHINGTON ¡ª Aerovironment, a leading supplier of unmanned aircraft systems to the U.S. military, has purchased Arcturus UAV for $405 million. Arcturus is currently competing for a $1 billion Army contract to replace the Shadow tactical unmanned aircraft system.Arcturus, which was founded in 2004 in California, specializes in Group 2 and 3 UAS, which run the gamut between drones over 20 pounds and under roughly 1,300 pounds.Army units are evaluating Arcturus¡¯ Jump 20 UAS. The drone is competing against Martin UAV and Northrop Grumman¡¯s V-Bat, Textron¡¯s Aerosonde HQ, and L3Harris Technologies¡ä FVR-90.The Jump is a multimission, medium-endurance, vertical-takeoff-and-landing system that can become airborne independent of a runway. Arcturus also makes the T-20, a multimission, medium-endurance, catapult-launched system.The Army is moving toward a final request for proposals with its Future Tactical UAS program that will replace the Shadow UAS, so the sale of Arcturus to a much larger UAV company is timely.Aerovironment did not have a path to Group 3 UAS, and bringing Arcturus into the fold fills that gap. According to those following the industry, Aerovironment has products that, when integrated into Arcturus¡¯ capabilities, could make for attractive future systems.Being acquired by a larger company like Aerovironment would also help the company become a more serious contender in the Army competition by building up its manufacturing capability to radidly produce UAS in large quantities, which the Army would require if the Jump is selected.The total purchase price of the sale is a combined $355 million in cash and $50 million in Aerovironment stock, according to a Jan. 13 news release.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeArcturus previously supplied UAS to U.S. Special Operations Command¡¯s $1.4 billion MEUAS III and IV programs, the release noted.¡°We are excited about the opportunities for value creation through our acquisition of Arcturus UAV, which will enable us to accelerate our growth strategy and expand our reach into the more valuable Group 2 and 3 UAS segments,¡± Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment president and CEO, said in the statement.¡°Group 2 and 3 UAS and services, collectively, potentially represent more than one billion dollars in annual contract value, according to an independent forecast,¡± he added. ¡°Combining our highly complementary products and technologies will enhance our portfolio, deliver top and bottom-line growth, and enable us to provide customers with a complete set of Group 1 through 3 UAS, tactical missile systems, high-altitude pseudo-satellites and unmanned ground vehicle solutions.¡±With Aerovironment, ¡°we will have greater scale, expanded resources, cutting-edge technology and superior capabilities to meet the growing global demand for our products and solutions,¡± D¡¯Milo Hallerberg, Arcturus UAV president and CEO, said in the statement. ¡°We are confident that with AeroVironment, we can accelerate our growth as part of a larger, more diverse company and look forward to working closely with the team to complete this exciting transaction.¡±The transaction is expected to be complete by the final quarter of fiscal 2021, and Arcturus will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aerovironment.",,Jen Judson ,2021/1/15,https://www.defensenews.com/land/2021/01/15/aerovironment-buys-arcturus-uav-405m-deal/

(Chris Machian/Omaha World-Herald via AP)MOSCOW ¡ª Russia said Friday it will withdraw from an international treaty allowing observation flights over military facilities following the U.S. exit from the pact.Russia¡¯s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.S. withdrawal from the Open Skies Treaty last year ¡°significantly upended the balance of interests of signatory states,¡± adding that Moscow¡¯s proposals to keep the treaty alive after the U.S. exit have been cold-shouldered by Washington¡¯s allies.The ministry said Russia is now launching the relevant procedural moves to withdraw from the pact ¡°due to the lack of progress in removing the obstacles for the treaty¡¯s functioning in the new conditions.¡± The Russian parliament, which ratified the treaty in 2001, will now have to vote to leave it.The treaty was intended to build trust between Russia and the West by allowing the accord¡¯s more than three dozen signatories to conduct reconnaissance flights over each other¡¯s territories to collect information about military forces and activities.U.S. President Donald Trump declared Washington¡¯s intention to pull out of the Open Skies Treaty in May, arguing that Russian violations made it untenable for the United States to remain a party. The U.S. completed its withdrawal from the pact in November.Russia denied breaching the treaty, which came into force in 2002. The European Union has urged the U.S. to reconsider and called on Russia to stay in the pact and lift flight restrictions, notably over its westernmost Kaliningrad region, which lies between NATO allies Lithuania and Poland.Russia has argued that the limits on flights over Kaliningrad, which hosts sizable military forces, are permissible under the treaty¡¯s terms, noting that the U.S. has imposed more sweeping restrictions on observation flights over Alaska.As a condition for staying in the pact after the U.S. pullout, Moscow sought guarantees from NATO allies that they wouldn¡¯t transfer the data collected during their observation flights over Russia to the United States, but was unsuccessful.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeLeonid Slutsky, the head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, said in televised remarks Friday that Russia could review its decision to withdraw if the U.S. decides to return to the pact, but acknowledged that the prospect looks ¡°utopian.¡±Moscow has warned that the U.S. withdrawal will erode global security by making it more difficult for governments to interpret the intentions of other nations, particularly amid Russia-West tensions after the Russian annexation of Ukraine¡¯s Crimea in 2014.The demise of the Open Skies Treaty follows the U.S. and Russian withdrawal in 2019 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.The INF Treaty, which was signed in 1987 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, banned land-based cruise and ballistic missiles with a range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,410 miles), weapons seen as particularly destabilizing because of the shorter time they take to reach targets compared with intercontinental ballistic missiles.The only U.S.-Russian arms control pact still standing is the New START nuclear agreement that expires in three weeks. Moscow and Washington have discussed the possibility of its extension, but so far have failed to overcome their differences.New START was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify complianceArms control advocates have warned that its expiration would remove any checks on U.S. and Russian nuclear forces, in a blow to global stability.",," Vladimir Isachenkov, The Associated Press",2021/1/15,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2021/01/15/russia-follows-us-to-withdraw-from-open-skies-treaty/
Indian government clears $6.5 billion deal for homemade Tejas fighter jets,,"The naval version of the Tejas light combat aircraft flies during a defense expo in Goa, India, on March 28, 2016. (B Satheesh Kumar)NEW DELHI ¡ª India on Wednesday cleared the country¡¯s largest-ever indigenous defense deal worth $6.5 billion for the purchase of 83 LCA MK1A Tejas light combat aircraft.The deal was approved by the government¡¯s apex security body, the Cabinet Committee on Security, which is chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The deal will see state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited manufacture 73 LCA MK1A Tejas fighter versions and 10 trainers versions, the Ministry of Defence said.¡°This deal will be a game-changer for self-reliance in Indian defence manufacturing.

Due on Inauguration Day: An acquisition strategy for the Air Force¡¯s next-gen battle management system,,"Tech. Sgt. John Rodiguez provides security with a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 prototype at a simulated austere base during the Advanced Battle Management System exercise on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., on Sept. 1, 2020. (Tech. Sgt. Cory D. Payne/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force¡¯s Advanced Battle Management System effort is a program like no other: a complicated and sometimes confusing web of communications, IT and artificial intelligence systems that the service plans to continuously test and develop with the goal of connecting sensors and shooters across the joint force.But over the next few weeks, Air Force leaders are aiming to finally answer looming questions about ABMS and transition it into more of a traditional defense program, all in the hopes that both Congress and the Biden administration carry it forward.In an exclusive Jan. 8 interview with Defense News, Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper said one of his main goals before President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20 is to ensure Air Force leaders sign off on an ABMS acquisition strategy. Once approved, the service can begin buying the first wave of cloud-based technologies that will allow stovepiped fighter jets to trade data during combat.¡°I believe, based on my last review with the Rapid Capabilities Office, that we¡¯ll get the [acquisition strategy] done before I timeout, and that¡¯s something I think it¡¯s important for me to hand off,¡± he said. ¡°I owe [the next administration] a program that is baselined with a schedule, a master test plan, everything that a normal program would have so that they can evaluate it like every other program has been handled.¡±The Air Force plans to gradually buy pieces of the ABMS system after experimenting with off-the-shelf and developmental products in ¡°on-ramp¡± demonstrations held several times throughout the year. The first release will comprise a suite of technologies allowing fighter jets and other tactical aircraft to share data with each other in combat, even when those planes use low-probability-of-intercept waveforms ¡ª like the F-35¡äs Multifunctional Advanced Data Link and the F-22¡äs Intra-Flight Data Link ¡ª that are incompatible with Link 16 and other data links commonly used by the military.The first technologies to be procured will include interim versions of CloudONE, a secure cloud; PlatformONE, a cloud-based software development environment; EdgeONE, an expeditionary cloud; GatewayONE, a data translator; and other products, Roper said.Aerial refueling tankers will play a critical role in the concept, hosting a podded payload that will make it a ¡°flying cellphone tower and data processor¡± capable of relaying communications data among aircraft, he said. The tanker would be positioned just outside an adversary¡¯s anti-access/area denial bubble ¡ª within line of sight of the fighter but far enough from most surface-to-air threats ¡ª and would be able to receive and transmit data through stealthy data links even when adversaries are jamming the Air Force¡¯s communications systems, Roper said.¡°If for whatever reason there¡¯s a new threat that popped up and a fighter was not in line of sight of a tanker ¡ª just like a fighter has to think, ¡®All right, do I need to go back and get more gas before I take on this new mission?¡¯ ¡ª the fighter could decide to fly back to within line of sight of the tanker [to get more data],¡± he said. ¡°And line of sight is a long way away; it¡¯s not like you¡¯re close to the tanker, you¡¯re just close enough to get that directional beam onto the airplane to which you¡¯re talking.¡±Know all the coolest acronymsSign up for the C4ISRNET newsletter about future battlefield technologies.Enter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeAir Mobility Command will choose which tanker will first get the ABMS pod, but the command is veering toward its newest refueling aircraft, the Boeing KC-46A.¡°There is a lot of potential on the wings currently where the aerial refueling pods go to put a data relay pod so that the tanker doesn¡¯t just act as a fuel tanker [but] it acts as a data tanker as well,¡± Roper said. ¡°And the KC-46 has some wonderful capabilities that it brings that the other mobility platforms don¡¯t ¡ª good radar warning, connectivity with the broader force that other tankers don¡¯t have.¡±Then the question will be: How many pods does Air Mobility Command want to buy?The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, which was tapped in November to lead procurement efforts for ABMS, will carry development of the pods and other new ABMS capabilities through low-rate production. The first technologies could be acquired as early as this year, Roper said in November.Once full-rate production is approved, the RCO will transition procurement authority over to other Air Force entities.For the tanker pods, the Air Force¡¯s program executive office for mobility and training will eventually purchase pods for the service¡¯s aerial refueling planes the same way it buys other tanker upgrades.An AT&T civilian contractor monitors the status interface of a An AT&T civilian contractor monitors the status interface of a ""Cell on Wings"" drone to provide 5G connectivity to participants of the Advanced Battle Management Systems Onramp 2 at White Sands Missile Range, N.M., on Aug. 27, 2020. (Staff Sgt. Charlye Alonso/U.S. Air Force)Roper said the ABMS on-ramps played a critical role in maturing many of the technologies that could roll into the first product release, proving that those items could plug into legacy platforms and connect with other products being tested.¡°It¡¯s just time for the program to move into its next phase. And I think once it does, that ABMS will become very boring from an acquisition strategy standpoint. It will seem very normal, although the capability demonstrations will continue to be very often.¡±Not ¡®Future Combat Systems, Part Two¡¯Despite having the support of Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles ¡°CQ¡± Brown and Chief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond, the ABMS program has not found solid footing with Congress and oversight organizations.Last spring, the Government Accountability Office said of the program that the service¡¯s lack of an acquisition strategy could result in schedule and cost delays.¡°The Air Force has not established a plan or business case for ABMS that identifies its requirements, a plan to attain mature technologies when needed, a cost estimate, and an affordability analysis. ¡­ To date, the Air Force has not identified a development schedule for ABMS, and it has not formally documented requirements,¡± the GAO stated in an April report.Congress cut spending for the program almost in half for fiscal 2021, citing unjustified program growth. In the end, it opted to fund about $159 million of the Air Force¡¯s $302 million request.Asked about what that means for the program, Roper expressed confidence that Air Force support for ABMS would continue, but he acknowledged the program still must answer outstanding questions from Congress.¡°We¡¯re during a transition phase ¡ª between one administration to the next ¡ª which creates uncertainty,¡± he said. ¡°I think it¡¯s also a gut check for the Air Force. Are we really going to stick with this nontraditional program across an administration change? It¡¯s a good time to change your mind if you want to. Chief Brown and Chief Raymond have been strong advocates in every public engagement they¡¯ve made that this is something the Air Force and Space Force have to do. So I¡¯m very confident that the Air Force and Space Force will stick with this as one of their highest priorities.¡±Although Congress still has questions about the program, Roper said he has seen improvement in how lawmakers view the program. Lawmakers are no longer concerned that ABMS could become a ¡°Future Combat Systems, Part Two,¡± he said, referencing a disastrous Army program in the mid-2000s for a family of systems that would include a high-speed network and a collection of new manned and unmanned vehicles.Instead, Congress wants answers about what technologies the Air Force will buy in the ABMS program, and the schedule for development, test and procurement ¡ª all questions that the acquisition strategy will answer, Roper said.¡°I think Congress has given us a lot of latitude to get started, and I think they¡¯re wanting to see: OK, are we really going to stick with it?¡± he said. ¡°And as long as they¡¯ll let the funding grow in our next budget submission, then I think we¡¯ll be able to keep the program on track.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2021/1/12,https://www.c4isrnet.com/smr/transition/2021/01/12/due-on-inauguration-day-an-acquisition-strategy-for-the-air-forces-next-gen-battle-management-system/
US Air Force chief of staff: How to prepare the service for tomorrow¡¯s fight,,"Two years ago, the Department of Defense implemented a new National Defense Strategy that recognized we live in a world that includes an ¡°increasingly complex global security environment, characterized by overt challenges to the free and open international order and the re-emergence of long-term, strategic competition between nations.¡± While the United States and our allies have been largely focused on counterinsurgency warfare since Sept. 11, our rivals have developed new technologies and capabilities seeking to challenge our advantage. Therefore, it is paramount we change and do so quickly, as the consequences of failure and success are both profound. Shortly after taking my current position, I published ¡°Accelerate Change or Lose¡± to articulate why I believe change is required.While many acknowledge the growing threat and need for change in our Air Force to be ready for tomorrow¡¯s fight, the pressing question is: How?To that end, I issued four action orders to focus and direct our energy, and harness the talent, creativity and resilience of our airmen to accelerate the change we need in a purposeful direction. Here¡¯s what we¡¯re doing right now, with much more to come this year, within the four action orders: airmen, bureaucracy, competition and design implementation.Airmen: It is critical we recruit, train and retain airmen who are capable of dealing with the ambiguity and complexity associated with a high-end fight. Therefore, we¡¯re looking at ways to continue attracting and training airmen to become confident in decision-making at the lowest levels of command. Equally important is taking care of our airmen to provide a quality of service and a quality of life where all can reach their full potential.To do so, we¡¯re revisiting our talent management, evaluation and promotion systems. We have already implemented new development categories to ensure deserving officers from all career fields are competitive for promotion, and we have started expanding our talent management programs to some of our enlisted career fields. We have also created a diversity and inclusion council that is engaged and already implementing impactful changes to set the foundation for sustainable change that will become an enduring part of our Air Force.The new US Air Force chief has a reputation of only asking for what he needs.

This clarity ¡ª when reinforced with disciplined execution ¡ª is designed to build upon our innovative culture, enhancing efficiencies, speeding up the decision cycle and driving change faster at all levels in our Air Force.Similarly, we are close to completing a massive undertaking that has revisited all Air Force instructions to streamline guidance, and we have gone to great lengths to slash and eliminate needless working groups at the headquarters level.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeCompetition: In my time as commander of Pacific Air Forces, I gained a deeper understanding of China¡¯s military capabilities and ambitions. Airmen must be taught and have an appreciation of the Chinese and Russian mindsets, military cultures and decision-making processes. Instilling a level of cultural and technical understanding of our rivals, to include how they are modernizing and planning to fight in the future, will help airmen discern which problems are most urgent and help us bridge our current force structure to the force we must rapidly develop to compete, deter and win.Design implementation: We must determine the capabilities and technologies that will make us competitive in the future. This entails clearing a path to implement the future Air Force design by removing capabilities and programs that are outdated or unaffordable. The Air Force must clearly articulate our future force design so that it is understood by our key stakeholders, including Congress, our industry partners and the public. We¡¯ve already amended our force-planning models to identify options that can free up money that will be necessary to rapidly assimilate new technologies, from artificial intelligence, to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control, to next-generation fighters and bombers. To implement these changes, we will collaborate with Congress and industry as we all work together to make tough choices important to our national security.From its inception over 70 years ago, the Air Force has excelled in the conduct of its five enduring core missions: air superiority; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; rapid global mobility; global strike; and command and control. We have an obligation to maintain the standard of excellence our nation has come to expect, regardless of the environment.Given the scope of the challenge with great power competitors such as China, we must make tough decisions to maintain a technologically superior force ¡ª one that is agile, resilient, and can operate at superior speed and tempo in the face of a complex fight.Change is critical and speed is paramount. Innovative problem-solving is deeply woven into the Air Force ethos. From the rapid development of the jet age and breaking the speed of the sound barrier in the 1940s, to the development of the sophisticated intercontinental ballistic missile inventory in the 1950s, to the design of air superiority platforms designed in the 1960s and 1970s, we have a history of rising to the occasion. While the need to change and develop is always pressing, not in recent history have the stakes been this high. The Air Force must accelerate, must change and must prepare for the future because the status quo will be insufficient, and failure is not an option.Gen.

German Air Force chief: The service is undergoing upgrades to meet future challenges,,"The German commitment to NATO is a fundamental pillar of our national stability and peace, and the Luftwaffe is at the heart of our national engagement within the alliance. The challenge for NATO is not only in the reorientation toward a common defense against a peer competitor, but also to respond proportionally to adversaries testing our security across multiple domains every day. The access to - and use of air and space - are of the upmost national and alliance importance; and therefore, they must be protected from misuse by state, industrial and individual hostile actors.The multinational air power exercise Air Defender 2023 is one of the Luftwaffe¡¯s key events. I am proud to say that the impetus for this exercise came from the Luftwaffe, and it was very well received by the U.S. Air Force, by NATO¡¯s Allied Air Command, by the Pentagon and by Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe. The Luftwaffe will engage with the maximum participation for Air Defense 2023 by integrating existing exercises and offering German air bases as a way to deliver supporting functions.In line with the German Federal Republic¡¯s security assessment, the Luftwaffe has also been assigned to demonstrate deterrence capability by projecting presence over great distances. The initial deployment of fighter and tanker aircraft to Australia will begin in 2022. This significant deployment cannot be underestimated: It is not just about the Luftwaffe deploying aircraft. It is about deploying and projecting air power over thousands of miles away from home.The future of the Luftwaffe¡¯s fighter aircraft will be seen through the lens of the Defence Ministry¡¯s proposed replacement of the aging Tornado fighter-bombers with the U.S. F/A-18F Super Hornet for air-to-ground missions, and the EA-18G Growler for jamming purposes. This electronic warfare aircraft will bring a unique capability to NATO in Europe and would become a key element in the Luftwaffe¡¯s approach in addressing current and future challenges in the electromagnetic spectrum. The multi-role Eurofighter will be upgraded to the new Tranche 4 level, and in conjunction with the F/A-18F and EA-18G, it would strengthen and carry the German fighter wings into the future operating environment.Three European air forces approve performance benchmarks for next-gen fighter jetThree European air forces approve performance benchmarks for next-gen fighter jetThe criteria will be used to whittle down the number of design options as the Future Combat Air System program proceeds through the next stages of development.By: Sebastian SprengerAlongside the fast-jet modernization program, strategic air transport and air-to-air refueling capabilities are paramount to both national and alliance air power. The steady growth of the A400M fleet enables the Luftwaffe to cover strategic air transport needs for national and allied mission support, including humanitarian relief operations. As the first European air force to provide air-to-air refueling capabilities with the A400M in operations over Syria, we delivered a positive message to our allies and a demonstration of capability to any potential aggressors.Intra-theater air transport is vital to success in current and future operations; therefore, Germany and France are rapidly progressing their road map to create a joint air transport squadron equipped with C-130J Hercules by 2021.Furthermore, the helicopter force will need to modernize its aging ¡°war horse¡± ¡ª the Sikorsky CH-53G ¡ª to ensure the fleet can continue to deliver the ¡°field delivery¡± capability in time and under all conditions, from the Arctic regions to the jungle or desert.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeOver the past years, space has developed into a highly dynamic and evolving domain. The Luftwaffe will resume responsibility for both air and space to ensure unity of effort and command for the entire domain.Confronted with a contested and congested environment in which potential aggressors could deny us access to our own area of operations, the concept of ¡°Joint All-Domain Operations¡± will counter new threats and continually improve to defeat future challenges. Interoperability ¡ª with the connecting of sensors and platforms across all operational domains ¡ª will drastically increase the speed of our own decision-making cycle and therefore operational output.A significant challenge of this generated and shared data is that it needs to be handled and processed in order to make it available in a useable format in a timely manner for our own and allied forces. ¡°Combat Cloud 2040+¡± is a long-term Luftwaffe goal in this information-heavy environment. In this context, the Next-Generation Weapon System program ¡ª combining command fighter aircraft with unmanned systems (Future Combat Air System) ¡ª will be at the core of the ¡°new¡± German Air Force.

"Lebanese Air Force chief: The future of air power, and its role in fighting terrorism",,"The rapid evolution of technology has imposed radical changes to the principles of military planning, on the tactical and strategic level, within the armed forces in general, and air forces in particular, in the war against terrorism. The use of precision fires and its relevant technology has by far overthrown that of mass fires, as minimizing collateral damage and reducing civilian casualties has become a priority. We cannot neglect the expanding role of drones and the potential they provide for military operations. Furthermore, cyber capabilities and electronic warfare have quickly entered the scene of modern warfare as essential assets.Based on this, weapon experts and future planners of air capability, especially in developed countries with limited financial resources, cannot consider technology on one hand and the possible development or modification of traditional weapons for the mid to long term on the other.The majority of armed forces tend to take advantage of advanced capabilities provided by technology, thus they work on reducing the number of personnel in the battlefield and in the area of operations. Relying on technology is evident through the use of UAVs in espionage, reconnaissance, and night and day surveillance operations to locate targets, then neutralize or destroy those targets using guided missiles. These aircraft are operated by specialized crews that can provide continuous coverage if necessary. After the data and the information are collected, they are analyzed and properly classified for quick reference at the appropriate time.These aircraft ¡ª with their capabilities, operational features and low operational cost ¡ª will replace many conventional weapons, equipment and manned aircraft. The capabilities provided by remotely controlled drones are among the most important ones that must be provided in the fight against terrorist organizations and their cells. Developing these systems in terms of advantages, capabilities and even size, taking into account their protection against electronic jamming, is crucial to enhance their operational role in asymmetric warfare.But we cannot forget about hostile, airborne capabilities, as adversaries can take advantage of locally manufactured drones and can launch attacks against sensitive centers and air assets. Eventually, acquiring counter-drone solutions is a demanding necessity of armed forces, starting with passive defense up to specialized systems to disrupt and neutralize these threats.Lebanese Armed Forces must act against Hezbollah to retain America¡¯s military aidLebanese Armed Forces must act against Hezbollah to retain America¡¯s military aidLebanon's military has been unwilling to lift a finger against Hezbollah. The problem is that doing so could spark an internecine conflict. But a lack of action could cut off funding from the United States.By: Bradley BowmanSocial networking has become a very effective tool to be used in unconventional wars, especially in the field of counterterrorism. Psychological warfare launched through social media can move the public opinion and manipulate feelings. Therefore, winning the hearts and minds of people can highly amplify the effect of psychological operations in a negative or a positive manner.The importance of addressing targets without causing collateral damage and injuring civilians has become a priority. Therefore, the necessity of providing the capability of smart, guided weapons has become an operational obligation that must be planned for. The plan must also include the selection and possession of the appropriate weapon and its ammunition to carry out the required tasks (in terms of target accuracy as well as the cost of achieving, storing and maintaining ammunition, etc.) in a manner compatible with the objectives to be addressed.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeMost of the weapons to be procured are selected through evaluating technical, operational and logistical aspects before selecting one in particular or selecting a certain manufacturer. All this is done so that the new weapon is interoperable with the rest of the available weapons or systems. This method is considered ideal for weapons acquisition.However, many unforeseen issues might emerge. A profound study of the new weapon¡¯s characteristics, including additions and modifications to these characteristics and, most importantly, its compatibility with the ground and air weapon arsenal, is a must. Hence, having assets working together in harmony is more important than the single capability provided by each weapon alone, no matter the capability of the new weapon.Mastery and professionalism in combining available capabilities and weapons are the most powerful approach to producing the maximum efficiency of weapon systems of any kind.The main drawback of technology is the complications that it imposes to operations and to planning. The adversaries that we might encounter may be invisible via difficult-to-detect or unconventional weapons. Therefore, we need to impose proper countermeasures and techniques to be able to overthrow the capabilities that our enemy might possess. Looking at the multiple risks and the modes that might be used, relevant risk assessment techniques must be employed to classify risks and to orient training and planning according to risk assessment.Throughout history, the principles of war constitute the solid foundation for any military victory. The closer the planners were to these principles, the better the outcome during battle. In modern warfare, surprise is still the most standing principle of war. Furthermore, employing sophisticated weapons and techniques along with the element of surprise doubles the desired effect. A real-life application of surprise in warfare can be taken from the experience of the Lebanese Air Force.Consider the battle of Danniyeh in 2000, in which the military surprised the al-Takfir wal-Hijra organization with an air assault operation and special forces executed a blockade to eliminate the adversaries, to the battle of Nahr al-Bared in 2007 against the Fatah al-Islam organization, in which the armed forces surprised the group by dropping 250- and 400-kilogram munitions from transport helicopters. Or the Lebanese armed forces¡¯ battles against ISIS and the Nusra Front between 2013 and 2017, when Puma transport helicopters were armed with 30mm cannons, 68mm SNEB rockets, and 250- and 400-kilogram bombs, which formed an effective air capacity that was not considered by the terrorists. The key to victory in all these battles was surprise.Moreover, surprise was most effectively employed during the Dawn of the Jurds operation in 2017. Aerial use of copperhead laser-guided artillery from armed Cessna AC-208 aircraft made a huge shift in the balance of power and led to the defeat of ISIS militants occupying a wide area of Lebanon¡¯s eastern border. Eventually, the terrorist group fled the area and full control was regained by the Lebanese Army.Among the most important challenges that air force planners will encounter is the ability to keep pace with rapid technological development as well as industry¡¯s progress on weapons and equipment ¡ª especially in a complicated theater of operations, such as counterterrorism. The ability to keep pace with technological evolution requires a minimum level of technical flexibility that facilitates the integration of any change or development of systems in a smooth manner and with an acceptable cost. All this goes back to a main principle: All advances and enhancements must form a homogeneous structure that accomplishes the mission and completes the role of other naval and land systems.Brig. Gen.

Pentagon¡¯s first demo of small counter-drone tech set for spring,,"Spc. Adam Wilhelmuses the Drone Defender V2 to disable a drone during training at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, on Aug. 19, 2020. (Sgt. Sirrina Martinez/U.S. Army)WASHINGTON ¡ª The first opportunity for industry to demonstrate technology for the Pentagon¡¯s enduring counter-drone capability will take place in April, according to the two-star general in charge of the joint effort.The Defense Department is developing a counter-small unmanned aircraft system capability for use domestically, in host nations and in conflict. The Pentagon established the Army-led Joint Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, or JCO, and approved a set of requirements to help counter small drones in September 2020, which laid a path for how industry can develop technology to plug into a single command-and-control system.The department released its first joint C-sUAS strategy Jan. 7 and will come out with an implementation plan that maps out a course of action by the end of the month. The strategy was just recently released, but the JCO has worked since its inception to produce an enduring set of systems.Over the first week of April, the first common test range event with industry will be held by the Army¡¯s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office as well as the Air Force, Army Maj.

Some also raised concerns about the threat to Israel¡¯s qualitative military edge in the Middle East.However, a December attempt in the Senate to block the arms sales failed, largely along party lines.

Charles ¡°CQ¡± Brown laid out a stark warning for the service: It has to change in several significant areas, or it risks losing the next war.In an Air Force news release Dec. 10, Brown issued action orders detailing how the service must ¡°accelerate change or lose.¡±The chief first outlined his four action orders ¡ª which focus on the need to change how the Air Force creates and manages its airmen, its bureaucracy, how it approaches competition against potential major adversaries such as China, and design implementation ¡ª in an address at the Air Force Association¡¯s virtual Air Space Cyber conference in September.¡°If we don¡¯t change, if we fail to adapt, we risk losing,¡± Brown said in September. ¡°We risk losing in a great power competition, risk losing in a high-end fight, risk losing quality airmen, losing budget dollars, our credibility and aspects of our national security.¡±In the Dec. 10 release, the Air Force said the action orders have spelled out what needs to change. Next, the Air Force must decide ¡°how¡± to change ¡ª with the help of from airmen across the force, who are being asked to share their ideas.¡°My strategic approach of ¡®Accelerate Change or Lose¡¯ explains the why,¡± Brown wrote in the action orders. ¡°These action orders provide the what. It¡¯s the way we address these action orders that will provide the how.¡±¡°It is all of us ¡­ our talented airmen ¡­ that are key to cutting unnecessary bureaucracy, recognizing and understanding our competition, and thinking of creative ways we can reshape the design of our Air Force,¡± Brown continued.In a sign of the importance Brown attaches to changing the way the Air Force recruits, trains, teaches, manages and develops its airmen, his first trips as chief of staff were to see basic training at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland and Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama.Sign up for the Air Force Times Daily News RoundupDon't miss the top Air Force stories, delivered each afternoonEnter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeThe first action order calls for updating how airmen are managed, based on best practices from both the public and private sectors, to make sure the Air Force has the quality force it needs, is an attractive career choice, and uses modern IT systems to manage its talent. It also calls for incorporating diversity and inclusion efforts throughout Air Force culture, not as a ¡°standalone program.¡±It also calls for eliminating or re-prioritizing ¡°low-value activities or processes¡± that aren¡¯t critical to the success of the Air Force¡¯s mission.Brown also said the Air Force¡¯s bureaucracy needs a ¡°tune-up,¡± so the service can make decisions as quickly as needed in a modern, global environment, and not run into barriers to innovation and success.¡°Current processes are too slow, allow ¡®soft vetoes¡¯ without accountability, incentivize counterproductive inter-[major command] and inter-functional fighting, and too often deliver sub-optimized solutions for the sake of compromise and consensus,¡± Brown wrote. The current USAF structure is optimized for an obsolete strategic context and must be updated to compete, deter, and win the high-end fight.¡±The Air Force will have to restructure to better support emerging models of generating and presenting its forces, push organizations to take perspectives and make decisions that consider the entire service, and provide a sustainable workload for airmen and their families, Brown wrote. Doing that will include speeding up communication between headquarters staff, limiting layers of bureaucracy that don¡¯t add much value, eliminating redundancies, and improving collaboration and integration across different organizations.The Air Force also needs to change how it understands its potential major competitors, their ambitions and how they might fight wars in the future, Brown said.That will mean starting to teach airmen the background of potential adversaries like Russia and China, Brown said ¡ª everything from their language and culture to how they educate their troops and view strategy.¡°Chinese and Russian objectives, mindset, and ways of warfare must be second nature so we can better shape the future together,¡± Brown said.The Air Force must also be much more agile in the way it designs new aircraft and other systems, and manages its existing systems, he said. That will include making ¡°tough choices,¡± he said, to identify systems and programs that are outdated or unaffordable, and cutting them to make way for the next generation of capabilities that will keep the Air Force competitive in future fights.Brown and many other senior leaders in the Air Force discussed how to enact changes in all four areas at October¡¯s Corona meeting at the Air Force Academy on Colorado Springs, Colorado, where action plans and proposed first steps were on the agenda for consideration.",,Stephen Losey,2020/12/28,https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2020/12/28/new-in-2021-air-forces-accelerate-change-agenda-takes-shape/

"Congress resurrects MQ-9 Reaper program, adding 16 drones for the Air Force",,"The sun won't set on the Reaper program for at least another year ¡ª as long as a budget bill is passed into law. (Senior Airman Haley Stevens/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Buried inside the massive $2.3 trillion spending package passed by Congress on Monday was a $286 million lifeline for General Atomics that will keep the Air Force buying MQ-9 Reaper drones at least one more year.In its fiscal 2021 budget request, the Air Force eliminated funding to procure the Reaper, instead requesting about $172 million to begin shutting down General Atomics¡¯ production line in Poway, California.The decision would have meant a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars for the company, as the Air Force previously intended to buy nine MQ-9s in FY21, 17 in FY22, two in FY23 and three in FY24, according to spending plans issued in FY20.Luckily for General Atomics, Congress has formally rejected the Air Force¡¯s plan.In its $696 billion spending bill for the Defense Department, lawmakers added about $286 million to buy 16 MQ-9 Reaper drones for the Air Force. That sum brings total procurement funding for the MQ-9 to approximately $344 million in FY21.Both chambers approved the legislation Monday evening, and it now awaits President Donald Trump¡¯s signature.¡°The decision to increase funding for the MQ-9 reflects the tremendous utility of the platform,¡± General Atomics spokesman C. Mark Brinkley said in a statement to Defense News. ¡°Through our ongoing investments in the aircraft and the development of new capabilities, we¡¯re demonstrating the untapped potential of the MQ-9 as part of the future force as it continues to be a high-value asset for our warfighters.¡±Whether Congress would intervene to save the MQ-9 program had been a major question for defense budget watchers. In July, the House Appropriations Committee unveiled its version of the defense spending bill that included additional funds for 16 MQ-9s. But when its Senate counterpart released its own proposal in November, it contained no money to buy additional Reapers, leaving the fate of the production line in limbo.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeIt¡¯s unclear whether the Air Force will attempt to shutter MQ-9 production in FY22, but over the past year the service has ramped up its pursuit of a Reaper replacement.The Reaper has been in service since 2007 and has spent more than a decade as the Air Force¡¯s drone of choice for conducting surveillance and strike missions in the Middle East. But with more advanced threats arriving on the battlefield and a greater number of commercial drones on the market, the service is considering replacing the MQ-9 with a family of systems that could perform low-end missions at a cheaper price as well as other options that are more survivable than the Reaper.The Air Force issued a request for information to industry on June 3 for the so-called MQ-Next program, seeking market research on available technologies as well as conceptual designs.Boeing, Kratos Defense, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and General Atomics all confirmed they responded to the Air Force solicitation.

Britain has one last contract for its Sentinel spy planes: Breaking them up,,"An R1 Sentinel aircraft at RAF Waddington. The British Defense Ministry announced in late 2020 that it is looking for a contractor to strip the planes for parts. (Sgt. Nik Howe/British Defence Ministry)LONDON ¡ª The British Royal Air Force¡¯s fleet of Sentinel battlefield and ground surveillance jets are officially heading for the scrapyard after the Ministry of Defence released a notice Dec. 22 seeking a company to break up the aircraft for spares.The Defence Equipment Sales Authority, the arm of the MoD responsible for disposing of surplus equipment, said it was looking for companies interested in stripping five Sentinel R1 aircraft and two Sentry E-3D airborne early warning aircraft for spares and dismantling what remains.The five Sentinel aircraft , a variant of the Bombardier Global Express business jet, were built at a cost of nearly ?1 billion (U.S. $1.3 billion), with Raytheon UK leading the extensive modification of the aircraft.The work to scrap the aircraft will be conducted at RAF Waddington ¨C the service¡¯s hub for all things related to intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) ¨C and other sites around the U.K.The notice said there is a significant number of associated inventory spares and ground support equipment available with the Sentinel.The time scale for the work is not known, but the battlefield-surveillance aircraft is scheduled to go out of service early next year having earned plaudits wherever it served following its first operational sortie over Afghanistan in 2008.The aircraft¡¯s synthetic aperture radar and ground moving target indicator have provided vital intelligence in places like Libya, Mali, Afghanistan, and most recently against Islamic State over Syria and Iraq.British defense secretary says ¡®tough choices¡¯ are coming due on spendingBritish defense secretary says ¡®tough choices¡¯ are coming due on spendingBritain¡¯s forces face some difficult decisions over whether to junk capabilities and make cuts to legacy programs.By: Andrew ChuterSign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe break-up notice brings to a close a 10-year squabble in the MoD to stop the premature curtailment of Sentinel operations.As early as the 2010 strategic defense and security review (SDSR) the MoD sought to axe the capability, only to temporarily reprieve the jet five years later when the next review appeared in 2015.The requirement for an expensive update of key systems proved to be the final nail in the coffin for Sentinel, though.Howard Wheeldon, a consultant at Wheeldon Strategic Advisory, said the military should have found the cash for the modernization of the jet.¡°That Sentinel required capability upgrading should not have been the reason for its premature withdrawal. ISTAR remains one, if not the most important, element of air power capability and taking a [capability] gap is unacceptable,¡± he said.¡°The decision to scrap Sentinel capability is not only one of the worst that emerged out of SDSR 2015 but it is also the one that I believe the U.K. will most likely come to regret. The lack of such important capability, and with no imminent replacement in prospect, is dangerous and ill advised,¡± Wheeldon said.The British are investing in new ISTAR capability like the Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, the Wedgetail airborne command and control platform, and the Protector long-endurance unmanned aircraft, but none of them are direct replacements for Sentinel capability.¡°Britain¡¯s reluctance to invest in Sentry capability over the past two decades typifies MoD failure in this sector.

The military is scrambling to understand the aviation crash risk from a new 5G sale,,"WASHINGTON ¡ª As part of a broader move to boost the 5G industry in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission on Dec. 8 began auctioning a portion of C-band electromagnetic spectrum, a move the committee¡¯s chairman, Ajit Pai, celebrated as ¡°a big day for American consumers and U.S. leadership in 5G.¡±But, in the weeks leading up to the auction, more than a dozen commercial aviation groups warned the sale could, as one study put it, lead to ¡°catastrophic failures¡± with the potential for ¡°multiple fatalities.¡±At the core of the concerns are radar altimeters, a critical piece of aviation technology used by military, commercial and civil aircraft of all types ¡ª including helicopters and unmanned aerial systems ¡ª to measure the distance between an aircraft and the ground.The aviation groups worry that 5G operations on the spectrum sold by the FCC could cause interference that would provide inaccurate readings on altimeters or cause their failure outright, in essence leaving pilots unaware of how far they are from the ground and potentially leading to crashes over the United States.According to a memo obtained by Defense News, those concerns are shared by the head of the Federal Aviation Administration and the number two at the Department of Transportation, who are calling on the FCC to pause the sale so the safety issue can be studied more closely. The FCC, in turn, has said its own technical studies show little to no risk involved and it intends to continue moving forward.Now, with the auction underway, the Defense Department is scrambling to catch up. The Pentagon has yet to determine the effect on military aircraft and has not established a formal position on the sale, with officials rushing behind the scenes to set up meetings and understand the potential long-term impacts.A Pentagon official, in response to questions from Defense News, would only say the department¡¯s policy board on federal aviation and aviation cyber initiative task force ¡ª an interagency organization led by the FAA ¡ª are reviewing reports by industry groups about the risk of 5G interference.Senior leaders from the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security, and the aviation cyber initiative plan to meet Dec. 21 ¡°to discuss findings and to establish an interagency way ahead to validate and respond to these reports,¡± the official stated.Among those expected to attend are Brig. Gen. Robert Barrie Jr., the official who manages Army aviation assets; Brig. Gen. Eric DeLange, director of the Air Force cyberspace operations and warfighter communications office; and several cyber experts from the FAA and DHS.Perhaps most notably, Honeywell Industries, a key producer of radar altimeters, has also been invited to discuss possible alternatives to current systems ¡ª a sign that the defense industry is taking the issue seriously. Honeywell declined to comment.If the spectrum sale continues, some experts are warning a best case scenario may be that the department has to spend millions of dollars and thousands of man hours to design, procure and install new radar altimeters across the military¡¯s fleet of airborne systems.The worst case?As one senior government official with experience in aviation said, ¡°There will be accidents, property¡¯s going to be destroyed and people are going to die.¡±Low-level flights like this firefighting efforts in a California Air National Guard C130-J Hercules could become a challenge if altimeters start to fail. (DoD photo)Low-level flights like this firefighting efforts in a California Air National Guard C130-J Hercules could become a challenge if altimeters start to fail. (DoD photo)The ongoing disputeUnder the Trump administration, the FCC has focused on the sale of spectrum in order to goose the nascent 5G industry, which administration officials see as a driver for American economic growth. Branded as the 5G FAST Plan, the commission has moved quickly to sell C-band spectrum.This particular auction involves spectrum in the 3.7¨C3.98 GHz frequency, with the hope of selling more than 5,000 new flexible-use overlay licenses. Satellite operators using the C-Band have agreed to repack their operations out of the band¡¯s lower 300 megahertz (3.7-4.0 GHz) into the upper 200 megahertz (4.0-4.2 GHz), in two stages. They expect to complete the move in December 2023. As of Dec. 17, more than 50 bidders had reportedly put forth over $15 billion in offers for the spectrum rights.Currently, the 3.7¨C3.98 GHz frequency portion of the C-Band is relatively quiet, occupied predominantly by low-powered satellites. For decades, this made the neighboring 4.2-4.4 GHz frequency a perfect place for the operation of radar altimeters, which are also called radio altimeters.But that frequency may not stay quiet for long. Once 5G telecommunications are introduced in the 3.7-3.98 portion of the band, there is a ¡°major risk¡± that those systems will create ¡°harmful interference¡± to radar altimeters, according to an October study from the RTCA, a trade organization that works with the FAA to develop safety standards.¡°The results of the study performed clearly indicate that this risk is widespread and has the potential for broad impacts to aviation operations in the United States, including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities, in the absence of appropriate mitigations,¡± the RTCA stated in its report. Research for the report was conducted by the Aerospace Vehicle Systems Institute, a cooperative research organization based out of Texas A&M University.Radio altimeters are critical during landings, once an aircraft moves below 2,500 feet from the ground. At that point, no other instruments provide an accurate measurement of a plane¡¯s distance from the ground.FCC to approve spectrum plan that Pentagon claims will harm GPSFCC to approve spectrum plan that Pentagon claims will harm GPSThe Pentagon and other government agencies have fought for years to keep Ligado Networks from getting approval to use L-Band spectrum, but that fight appears to be on its last legs.By: Aaron Mehta and Mike Gruss¡°It¡¯s so important to have an accurate reading, because if it¡¯s a bad reading it could lead to the airplane doing something you don¡¯t want it to do.¡± explained Terry McVenes, the RTCA president and chief executive. McVenes is a former Boeing safety executive with 30 years¡¯ experience in the commercial aviation industry.¡°If your airplane thought it was 1,000 feet above the ground but was only 50 feet above the ground, well¡­ you could have a problem,¡± he said.The trade group filed the report with the FCC in early October, and shortly afterward met with an FCC engineering team. But since then, ¡°We¡¯ve heard nothing back from the FCC, had no other direct interactions with them¡± outside the official filling process, he said.The release of the study triggered a last-minute request by 12 trade groups, including the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents military aviation companies, to consider mitigation efforts based on the report. The groups called the findings ¡°the most comprehensive analysis and assessment to date on this subject, based on the best assumptions, parameters, and data¡­ It has been peer reviewed for accuracy and validity and should not be dismissed by the Commission.¡±The report has also gained the attention of Steven Bradbury, the acting deputy secretary for transportation, and Steve Dickson, the FAA administrator, who in a Dec. 1 letter obtained by Defense News warned that the spectrum sale could specifically damage both the Terrain Awareness Warning System, a major safety function for aircraft, and Autoland features relied on for pilots when landing a plane.¡°Given the scope of the safety risk, and based upon our current knowledge, it is unclear what measures will be necessary to ensure safe operations in the [National Aerospace System], or how long it will take to implement such measures,¡± the two leaders wrote. ¡°Depending upon the results of further analysis, it may be appropriate to place restrictions on certain types of operations, which would reduce access to core airports in the U.S. and, thus, reduce the capacity and efficiency¡± of commercial aviation. (Airman 1st Class Codie Collins/Air Force)(Airman 1st Class Codie Collins/Air Force)That letter, sent to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, was requested to be added to the FCC¡¯s public docket. However, the letter has not been posted to the FCC¡¯s public docket as of press time.The FCC and supporters of expanding 5G argue that the concerns are overblown.¡°In the C-Band Order, the Commission concluded that our rules would protect radio altimeters used by aircraft, and we continue to have no reason to believe that 5G operations in the C-Band will cause harmful interference to radio altimeters,¡± Will Wiquist, a spokesman for the FCC, said in a statement. ¡°Among other things, these altimeters operate with more than 200 megahertz of separation from the C-band spectrum to be auctioned, more protection than is afforded in some other countries.¡°Moreover, the RTCA report was prepared outside of the joint aviation/wireless industry group that was set up at the Commission¡¯s request and is not a consensus position of that group. Indeed, at least one other member of that multi-stakeholder group has expressed significant concerns with the study and several of its assumptions, and the Commission¡¯s experts have concerns with this study as well.¡±The member group that expressed concerns about the study is the wireless trade association CTIA, which in December filled with the FCC a document that called the findings ¡°lacking and unreliable¡± and ¡°unsound and unsupported.¡± Among the specific concerns raised by CTIA were that altimeter requirements used in the report were overly stringent, that it did not break down results by altimeter brand and model, and that the report relied on ¡°unrealistic¡± scenarios during testing.McVenes said RTCA is open to conducting the research again if presented with new data to work with, but has yet to see that information from CTIA or the FCC.Risks to military aviationAlthough the RTCA study looked exclusively at civil and commercial aircraft, almost all military aircraft are equipped with radar altimeters that are very similar to their commercial counterparts, said the senior government official. Defense News granted anonymity for this official to speak candidly about the risks to pilot safety.While radar altimeters made for military aircraft are sometimes built to slightly more stringent requirements ¡ª having the ability to function in extremely cold or hot environments, for instance, or to withstand higher gravitational forces ¡ª they still reside on the same portion of the spectrum as commercial ones and are vulnerable to the same interference, the senior government official said.The cargo planes and aerial refueling tankers operated by the Air Force¡¯s Air Mobility Command would be most hindered by the interference produced by 5G due to their similarities to commercial aircraft, said Mike Holmes, a retired Air Force four-star general and former head of Air Combat Command. Holmes reviewed the RTCA report at Defense News¡¯ request.Many of the Air Force¡¯s mobility assets are either based on commercial passenger jets, such as the Boeing 767-derived KC-46 tanker, or are equipped with commercial off-the-shelf avionics. As such, certain mobility aircraft are approved to conduct landings in bad weather conditions when the pilot has to rely on the aircraft¡¯s instruments ¡ª such as the radar altimeter ¡ª instead of visual cues.¡°You wouldn¡¯t be able to fly that approach if your radar altimeter was being interfered with and you couldn¡¯t get a good signal,¡± Holmes said. ¡°For the military¡­you¡¯d probably divert someplace else.¡±For tactical aircraft, the bigger concern would be low-level flights over terrain such as mountains. Fighter pilots use their radar altimeters when flying close to the ground to evade enemy radar or surface-to-air threats. However, Holmes noted that not all fighter jets ¡ª such as the 1970s era F-15C ¡ª have radar altimeters, and that pilots would still be able to rely on visual cues.Helicopters flying low or near mountains could be at risk, a senior government official said. (CW2 Cameron Roxberry/U.S. Army)Helicopters flying low or near mountains could be at risk, a senior government official said. (CW2 Cameron Roxberry/U.S. Army)Still, he said, if a radar altimeter is offering faulty information due to interference, that could lull pilots into a false sense of security about how far they are from the ground.¡°Part of [the problem] is going to be trying to know whether you¡¯re getting interference or not,¡± he said.The senior government official noted that the special operations community could be particularly hurt by 5G interference. Certain aircrews of platforms, such as the C-130 or C-17, receive specific training to fly special operations low level missions, which involve flying close to the ground and inserting or extracting special operators, and those training missions may become more difficult to execute if 5G interference is a problem.This training ¡°is often executed under the cover of darkness. Depth and obstacle perception can be hindered in darkness due to the human eye¡¯s cell structure,¡± the official said. ¡°Night vision goggles provide compensation but still limit the pilot¡¯s situational awareness.¡±If the sales go through, the military will likely have to modify or replace its altimeters to meet whatever new safety standards the FAA eventually approves to mitigate the risks of 5G interference, Holmes said.¡°If you go ahead and give up this part of the spectrum, the interference will drive changes that have to be made either to modify the equipment that is being used for 5G, to modify the equipment that are on airplanes, or to modify the procedures that determine how you use that equipment,¡± Holmes said.Replacing or modifying altimeters will take time and funding ¡ª two commodities defense experts predict will be in short supply over the coming years ¡ª as defense budgets flatten.In the near term, Holmes projects the services will change their training practices to eliminate any added risk to pilots caused by altimeter interference, such as restricting pilots of certain aircraft from landing in bad weather or ensuring that pilots of fighter aircraft take off with enough fuel so that they can divert to another airport if their radar altimeter no longer works.In short, the military will have to give up money, time and effectiveness to fix the problem.¡°The outcome would be lack of efficiency. You wouldn¡¯t fly [certain] approaches in bad weather. So there would be times you couldn¡¯t go do what you were [planning on] doing, whether that¡¯s moving passengers or cargo in the civilian world or whether that was passengers or cargo in the military,¡± Holmes said.¡°But ultimately, I would think the impact is going to be greater on the commercial airline world than it was on the military world.¡±An MQ- Reaper remotely piloted aircraft performs aerial maneuvers over Creech Air Force Base, Nev., June 25, 2015.

Payne/U.S. Air Force)An MQ- Reaper remotely piloted aircraft performs aerial maneuvers over Creech Air Force Base, Nev., June 25, 2015. Such flights could be impacted if altimeters start to fail. (Senior Airman Cory D. Payne/U.S. Air Force)A billion dollar problemWhile the satellite operators who currently operate within 3.7-3.98 GHz will receive some proceeds of the sale, allowing them to move to another portion of the spectrum, no funding is set to be given to the civil, commercial and government entities that rely on radar altimeters for safe aerospace operations.As a result, it is likely that the U.S. military will have to replace ¡°many or most¡± of the radar altimeters currently onboard its airplanes, helicopters and drones, the senior government official said. And because radar altimeters have all been developed to operate on the same portion of the spectrum, there is no off-the-shelf replacement already on the market for which interference wouldn¡¯t be a concern.On the commercial side, McVenes said if industry has to replace altimeters across its fleet, a price tag of ¡°several billion dollars is probably on the low estimate.¡± That price tag could well jump for the military side, given the complexity of work on military systems - it is easier to swap out a part on a commercial plane than a stealth-coated fighter - and the infamous prices of defense procurement.Meanwhile, the Defense Department could need to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into the engineering work necessary to develop new altimeters, procuring those systems, testing and recertifying each platform for normal operations, and finally, installing the new hardware on potentially hundreds or thousands of aircraft across the military¡¯s inventory.¡°It will take many years, if not decades,¡± the senior government official said.Fighter jets may be the least impacted by the altimeter concerns. (Airman 1st Class Cory W. Bush/U.S. Air Force)Fighter jets may be the least impacted by the altimeter concerns. (Airman 1st Class Cory W. Bush/U.S. Air Force)In the two months since the report was released, industry has jockeyed to get more time to study the issue and to put measures in place to mitigate the risks.In a Nov. 17 letter to the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Aerospace Industries Association and 13 other aerospace trade groups implored members of Congress to take action to protect the frequency bands used by radar altimeters.¡°We are concerned that without this congressional intervention to understand potential implications and ramifications, decisions will be made with a frightening lack of understanding of aviation requirements,¡± the groups stated.Help from Congress seemingly came Dec. 7, when Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who leads the House committee, sent a letter to FCC Chairman Pai calling for the commission to postpone the sale.¡°These RTCA findings are alarming; they not only align with earlier research identifying harmful effects of 5G networks to radio altimeters, but they reflect a clear need for the FCC to return to the drawing board with this premature plan,¡± he wrote. ¡°There is no question that additional study is needed to understand the full extent and severity of 5G interference with radio altimeters and whether any mitigations are feasible ¡ª or even possible ¡ª to ensure flight safety.¡°We must never take a chance with aviation safety ¡ª and at no point should commercial interests be placed above it.¡±A day later, the FCC pressed forward with the auction.Valerie Insinna is the air warfare reporter for Defense News.

Here¡¯s why the Valkyrie drone couldn¡¯t translate between F-35 and F-22 jets during a recent test,,"A U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor and F-35A Lightning II fly in formation with the XQ-58A Valkyrie drone over Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona during a series of tests Dec. 9, 2020. This integrated test follows a series of gatewayONE ground tests that began during the inaugural Air Force on-ramp in December 2019. (Tech. Sgt. James Cason/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Earlier this month, the U.S. Air Force embarked on a hotly anticipated test: Could it use a semiautonomous drone, in this case a Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie equipped with a special payload, to stealthily translate and send data between F-35 and F-22 fighter jets?Air Force leaders still think the answer is ¡°yes,¡± but because of technical issues encountered during the test, proof that the concept works is still months away.During the Dec. 9 demonstration at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, the Valkyrie was outfitted with gatewayONE, a system capable of translating information from the F-35¡äs Multifunctional Advanced Data Link and the F-22¡äs Intra-Flight Data Link into a format that can be understood by other aircraft, all while maintaining a low probability of enemy forces intercepting that data.But ¡°shortly after takeoff, the communications payloads lost connectivity,¡± leaving nine out of 18 test objectives incomplete, the Air Force said in a news release.Early feedback from the test team indicates that, during the rocket-assisted takeoff of the Valkyrie, some of the gatewayONE hardware came loose from where it was mated to the drone, said Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper.¡°We think we had a connector that came loose during it because the gateway itself was fine when the Valkyrie landed. So [it¡¯s] a thing we¡¯ve learned from and we¡¯ll fix next time,¡± he told reporters Dec. 18 during a Defense Writers Group roundtable. ¡°Next time we get out, flying in the next on-ramp, we¡¯ll probably check those soldering points more than one time.¡±Despite the setbacks, the Air Force still clocked in a number of wins during the exercise.Because the service had a second, land-based version of gatewayONE, it was able to use that system to pass targeting cues from an F-35 to an F-22 and exchange other data between the two aircraft. GatewayONE also pushed data that usually is confined to operations centers on the ground to the F-35 and F-22, while allowing those aircraft to send precise location data back through the translating system to the operations center.Sign up for our Unmanned Systems newsletterGet a bi-weekly update on the challenges and opportunities surrounding the use of drones.Enter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeAlthough the Valkyrie couldn¡¯t transmit data between the F-22 and F-35, it still safety demonstrated that it could fly semiautonomously in operations with the two stealth jets for the first time ever.Aside from the inclusion of the XQ-58A, it¡¯s unclear how the Dec. 9 demonstration differs from ground tests of a similar system during the first Advanced Battle Management System on-ramp exercise in 2019.During that demo, the Air Force rigged together a number of radio systems built by F-35 and F-22 prime contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman with antennas from Honeywell, and the aircraft flew over the test stand, exchanging data, officials said.As early as 2015, Northrop has touted its Freedom 550 radio as a translator for the F-35 and F-22, but it is unknown whether the technology is part of the gatewayONE system. The Air Force did not respond to questions from Defense News seeking more information about gatewayONE, such as a request to identify the manufacturer.During a phone call with reporters on Dec. 16, Air Force Chief Architect Preston Dunlap said the next opportunity for the service to experiment with the gatewayONE payload onboard Valkyrie is during the Advanced Battle Management System experiment slated for May 2021.Using a low-cost, expendable drone like the XQ-58 to transmit data between platforms is a contrast from the Air Force¡¯s usual approach for solving communications challenges among its assets, Dunlap said. Usually, as new data links or waveforms are developed, aircraft must be retrofitted with new radios and apertures ¡ª an expensive and time-consuming process that often leaves platforms out of the loop.¡°It¡¯s obvious to me that it¡¯s not a winning strategy and is a real estate problem on some of these platforms, but then it¡¯s a lost opportunity because when you have diversity of pathways, you have greater assurance,¡± he said.By creating a small, modular payload like gatewayONE that can be carried by a number of manned and unmanned aircraft, the Air Force will have more options for getting data into the cockpits of all of its planes.¡°The real big win ¡ª and we heard this from the pilots themselves ¡ª is being able to push information into their cockpits so that they have access to it in a way that is operationally relevant and useful to them,¡± Dunlap said. ¡°It¡¯s not all the data they would want, but it has opened a door that¡¯s amazing. So we¡¯ve got to keep pushing the technology.¡±The Dec. 9 test was carried out by personnel from the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and the 46th Test Squadron from Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.",,Valerie Insinna,2020/12/18,https://www.c4isrnet.com/battlefield-tech/it-networks/2020/12/18/heres-why-the-valkyrie-drone-couldnt-translate-between-an-f-35-and-f-22-during-a-recent-test/
Russia is developing a helicopter drone to destroy other drones,,"Russia has at least two helicopter drones currently under development. (Skapie777/Getty Images)MOSCOW ¡ª Russia is developing a helicopter drone to assist anti-aircraft weapon systems in their counter-UAV mission. The project, accelerated shortly after the recent conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan began in mid-2020, will fill a gap in Russia¡¯s military capabilities.The new drone will ¡°track down small and low-speed enemy drones at low and extremely low altitudes,¡± a source in the military-defense complex told the Russian government news agency RIA Novosti this month.The source said the helicopter drone has been under development since November, adding that research and development efforts were accelerated in response to the ¡°increasing role of attack drones during the last local conflicts.¡±He didn¡¯t provide specifics, but various types of Turkish-made drones were used during the Azeri-Armenian conflict and helped Azeri forces break Armenia¡¯s defense.According to the source, the new model will be developed using existing technology to speed up manufacturing. But senior military analyst Mikhail Khodaryonok, a former colonel from the Soviet air defense force, is skeptical about the use of helicopter drones in the air defense mission.¡°It has to carry a lot of equipment and it will be costly. It is better to use classic land-based radars, which can be more accurate,¡± he told Defense News.Defense News reached out to the Russian government for more information but did not receive additional details.This is not Russia¡¯s only helicopter drone currently under development. Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a government publication, reported the country is also developing a new attack helicopter drone.

The F-35¡äs interoperability tech strengthens US alliances,,"An F-35B takes off from the deck aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth at sea on Oct. 10, 2020. (1st Lt. Zachary Bodner/U.S. Marine Corps)The U.S. State Department recently gave the green light to Finland and Switzerland to purchase the F-35 aircraft. It¡¯s not a fait accompli ¡ª the F-35 still needs to win each country¡¯s competitions ¡ª but it¡¯s telling that two friendly, but non-NATO, European countries are seriously considering the adoption of America¡¯s fifth-generation, front-line fighter as their own.The interest of Finland and Switzerland in the F-35 is driven at least in part by the desire for a fighter that won¡¯t be virtually obsolete upon delivery. But moreover, it further underscores the recognized necessity among our allies, partners and friends to improve our collective interoperability, especially among our air forces.The public tends to associate the F-35 with stealth, and indeed its small signature makes it far more survivable and lethal than fourth-generation legacy airframes when pitted against advanced Russian-made anti-aircraft missile batteries.But in addition to survivability and lethality, more countries are seeking interoperability with friends and allies, and the F-35 delivers in this crucially important area.The British Royal Navy¡¯s HMS Queen Elizabeth demonstrated the power of the F-35¡äs interoperability only a few weeks ago. The Royal Navy¡¯s battle group featured escort vessels from the Netherlands and the United States, but the centerpiece of the battle group was two squadrons of F-35B aircraft ¡ª one from the Royal Navy and one from the U.S. Marine Corps.Italy¡¯s Navy-Air Force tussle over the F-35 comes to a headItaly¡¯s Navy-Air Force tussle over the F-35 comes to a headDeadlines approach for deciding which service will get the next aircraft to roll off the production line, and where it will be based.By: Tom KingtonCapt. James Blackmore, the U.K.¡¯s carrier air wing commander, noted the importance of the learning experience gained in working side by side with the Marines. But, he said, ¡°this is much more than that; this is the alliance in action, demonstrating that two close allies can not only fly from each other¡¯s carriers, but can fight alongside each other should we need to. This level of integration offers a decisive flexibility in times of crisis, conflict or war.¡±A recent study, written by the think tank Rand and commissioned by U.S. European Command, hails the interoperability of the F-35 as a key element in Europe¡¯s collective defense. The study asserts that ¡°modernization among a number of European air forces, including through the introduction of fifth-generation aircraft, could offer an essential contribution to transatlantic security, enhance deterrence, and provide commanders much-needed combat power and flexibility in the event a major conflict ensues.¡±Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe Rand study notes that NATO members are beginning to learn how to leverage ¡°the F-35¡äs unique capability to provide battlefield situational awareness in highly contested environments.¡± The overall takeaway: The F-35 plays a critical role, now and for many years to come, in binding the United States and our European allies together, in peace, competition, or conflict.Baroness Goldie, the U.K. minister of state for defense, has underscored the points made in the Rand study, highlighting our shared strategic interests in ¡°upholding the rules-based international system.¡± This message, when carried on a platform consisting of Britain¡¯s newest aircraft carrier with embarked F-35Bs from both the Royal Air Force and U.S. Marine Corps, carries particular weight and emphasis.Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, America and its allies face a growing challenge from China as it asserts claims to neighboring lands and sea lanes, and pursues rapid military modernization to back up those claims and deny access to U.S. and allied ships and planes in international waters. The HMS Queen Elizabeth¡¯s maiden deployment with F-35s is expected to include the Indo-Pacific, demonstrating that all nations with maritime interests have a stake in meeting the maritime challenges occurring in this region.The ability of the United States to deploy well within harm¡¯s way, side by side with our allies, is critical to maintaining a credible deterrent posture in the Indo-Pacific region. Again, the interoperability of the F-35 plays a key role.Very recently, the USS America, a flat-topped amphibious assault ship, conducted integrated air defense and sea control operations with F-35s from Japan¡¯s Air Defense Command. Capt. Luke Frost, the commanding officer of the America, said: ¡°These are the most advanced capabilities to ever sail or fly. America is a fifth-generation amphibious assault platform, built from the keel up to optimize the most advanced capability of the fifth-generation F-35 platform. We are forward-deployed to integrate exactly these advanced capabilities with Japan.¡±Allies from Norway to Poland in Europe, and from Australia to South Korea in the Pacific, are already realizing the tangible benefits afforded by the F-35¡äs interoperability. The F-35¡äs fifth-generation interoperability helps create connective tissue that reinforces relationships with allies, partners and friends who share common views and commitments. Operating side by side, we are simultaneously broadening and deepening those relationships through demonstrated commitment to each other. That interoperability makes the F-35 a unique and indispensable contribution to improving foreign relations with our allies and friends.Retired U.S. Navy Adm.

The first 9 attempts to retrieve swarming Gremlins drones failed. Here¡¯s what¡¯s next.,,"A C-130 flies next to a X-61A Gremlins drone. (DARPA)WASHINGTON ¡ª The idea behind DARPA¡¯s Gremlins program is simple: Turn cargo aircraft like the tried-and-true C-130 into motherships capable of launching and retrieving swarms of small drones. But a recent test proves execution of that goal may be easier said than done.During a series of flight tests that started Oct. 28, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency made nine attempts to recover three X-61A Gremlins Air Vehicles in flight. Each failed, the agency said in a news release, which characterized the effort as ¡°just inches from success.¡±The tests marked the first time DARPA has attempted to recover the Gremlins drones ¡ª made by Leidos subsidiary Dynetics ¡ª via a capture device mated to the same C-130 that deployed the air vehicles. During a successful recovery, the C-130 would lower a docking bullet that helps stabilize each vehicle from the turbulence generated by the C-130. Once in place, an engagement arm would grab the X-61A and drag it into the C-130¡äs cargo bay.However, during the October tests, the Gremlins drones were never able to mechanically engage with the docking station because the ¡°relative movement was more dynamic than expected and each GAV, ultimately, safely parachuted to the ground,¡± DARPA stated.DARPA¡¯s program manager Scott Wierzbanowski sounded an optimistic note about the tests, saying the challenges encountered were not insurmountable.¡°All of our systems looked good during the ground tests, but the flight test is where you truly find how things work,¡± Wierzbanowski said. ¡°We came within inches of connection on each attempt but, ultimately, it just wasn¡¯t close enough to engage the recovery system.¡±Not everything went wrong during the recent demonstrations, DARPA said. Over three flights, each X-61 flew for more than two hours, allowing DARPA to further validate the drone¡¯s ability to operate autonomously. The agency also collected ¡°hours of data¡± that will help it to understand aerodynamic interactions between the Gremlins drone and the capture device, which program officials will study to understand how the system needs to be modified.DARPA will then attempt to fly and recover the Gremlins drones this spring.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribe¡°We made great strides in learning and responding to technological challenges between each of the three test flight deployments to date,¡± said Wierzbanowski. ¡°We were so close this time that I am confident that multiple airborne recoveries will be made in the next deployment. However, as with all flight testing, there are always real world uncertainties and challenges that have to be overcome.¡±This isn¡¯t the first time there have been anomalies during Gremlins tests. When DARPA first launched the Gremlins aircraft from a C-130A during a November 2019 demo held at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, an X-61A flew almost two hours while the test team completed every objective, including testing the air vehicle¡¯s data links and deploying the docking station.But when the time came to recover the drone, one of its two parachutes didn¡¯t deploy, leaving the vehicle to crash to the ground.Eventually, DARPA wants to demonstrate that it can safely and reliably launch and recover four Gremlins drones within 30 minutes.Meeting that goal would open up a world of possibilities to the military, allowing the services to deploy swarms of small, inexpensive, reusable drones with different sensors and payloads from legacy aircraft ¡ª a capability the Defense Department currently lacks. Those swarms could move closer to adversary airspace and do tasks such as gathering imagery or providing a communications relay without having to endanger human aircrew.",,Valerie Insinna,2020/12/11,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/11/the-first-nine-attempts-to-retrieve-swarming-gremlins-drones-failed-heres-whats-next/
The B-1B just launched a cruise missile externally. Hypersonic missiles could be next.,,"A B-1B Lancer launches an intert AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM, from an external pylon on its fuselage during tests Dec. 4, 2020 at Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. (Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The B-1B Lancer has successfully fired a stealthy cruise missile from an external pylon for the first time, adding another capability to the Bone¡¯s massive arsenal and potentially paving the way for the bomber to launch hypersonic missiles in the future.During the demonstration, held Dec. 4 at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, the B-1 launched an inert AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, or JASSM, from an external pylon that normally would carry the Sniper targeting pod.The test proves the B-1B can be configured to carry weapons externally ¡ª opening the door for new weapons configurations for the formidable Bone, including the potential ability to launch hypersonic missiles when they become available.¡°Arming a limited number of B-1s with more weapons externally, could enable Global Strike Command to provide more weapons for geographic Combatant Commanders while putting fewer aircraft and aircrew in harm¡¯s way,¡± said Gen. Tim Ray, who leads Air Force Global Strike Command.The test was conducted by the 419th Flight Test Squadron with a B-1 assigned to the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Boeing is the prime contractor for the B-1, while Lockheed Martin manufactures JASSM.To launch the JASSM externally, the Air Force team had to reassign one of the B-1¡äs internal weapon stations to the hard point on the forward right hand side of the aircraft. The team also modified the pylon itself ¡°to allow for different connector configurations, and the internal wiring was replaced with harnesses that would support its new role,¡± said N. Keith Maynard, the special instrumentation flight chief for the 812th Airborne Instrumentation Test Squadron.Last year, the Air Force tested modifications to its internal bomb bay to allow it to carry heavier weapons. In November, the B-1B carried an inert JASSM missile on a pylon under the fuselage for the first time, further expanding the aircraft¡¯s weapons load.A B-1B takes off for flight tests, outfitted with a AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile affixed to a pylon under the aircraft's fuselage.

The conversion process involved welding a metal sleeve on each of the B-1s aft pylon attachments, preventing them from being used to carry air-launched cruise missiles.Air Force Global Strike Command spokesman Lt. Col. David Faggard told Military.com in November the Air Force may pursue permanent modifications to the B-1B that would allow it to carry 24 JASSMs or Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles internally, as well as 6 to 12 of those weapons externally ¡ª giving two B-1s the firepower of three B-1s today.If that occurs, the bomber ¡°will remain treaty-compliant¡± because ¡°the expanded capabilities will be conventional-only,¡± he said.Now that the launch is over, the Air Force test team is focused on analyzing the data gathered. Simulations show that a launch of a JASSM from a B-1 should conform to the same timeline as when launched from the left pylon of a B-52, said Agustin Martinez of the 419th FLTS.To collect imagery of the missile launch, the Air Force outfitted the B-1 with high speed cameras that can capture up to 500 frames per second.¡°The most important product for this specific mission is excellent imagery of the release from multiple angles to not only verify safe separation but to provide information about the weapon itself, like fin deployment,¡± Maynard said.Flying forwardDespite the potential for new weapons capabilities, the Air Force still plans to reduce the number of B-1s in the bomber fleet.During the FY21 budget request, the service announced that it would retire 17 B-1s that had become particularly difficult to maintain after years of hard flying in the Middle East. The money saved would be diverted to other Air Force modernization priorities, including space and joint all domain command and control.Last week, the House and Senate armed services committees agreed to allow the Air Force to mothball those bombers as long as it could maintain a combat-coded B-1 fleet of at least 36 bombers. It must also put four of the 17 retired bombers into long-term storage, so that they can be refurbished and flown if needed in the future.Meanwhile, the tempo of operations for the B-1 community remains high as the Air Force balances short and long-term deployments of its bombers across the globe.On Dec. 6, the Air Force announced that B-1 bombers from the 37th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron at Elsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota, had temporarily deployed to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.While in Guam, the bombers will participate in training exercises with partner nations and conduct strategic deterrence missions, the service said.",,Valerie Insinna,2020/12/9,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/09/the-b-1b-just-launched-a-cruise-missile-externally-hypersonic-missiles-could-be-next/

However, Airbus, along with its co-contractors Dassault Aviation and Indra, face a ¡°very tough roadmap¡± to finalize system designs, begin preliminary development, launch production, and get the systems into service, said Bruno Fichefeux, FCAS leader for Airbus, during the company¡¯s annual trade media briefing Dec. 9.The 18-month Joint Concept Study and Phase 1A of the demonstrator portion are progressing well, but the companies need to move quickly to reach key technology maturation phases, he said. ¡°This is a major de-risking and speeding approach towards the future development program, to ensure that we are on time on expectation.¡±France, Germany and Spain have teamed up on the FCAS program, which includes seven next-generation technology pillars: a sixth-generation fighter jet, multiple ¡°remote carrier¡± drones, a next-generation weapon system, a brand new jet engine, advanced sensors and stealth technologies, and an ¡°air combat cloud.¡±In September, the nations¡¯ three air forces worked together to down-select the five preferred architectures that will help inform the program¡¯s follow-on phases, Fichefeux said at the virtual briefing.The goal for 2021 is for FCAS to enter the preliminary demonstrator development phase for the next-generation fighter and the remote carrier aircraft. Those contracts are currently in negotiations, he noted. Starting in 2021, the FCAS will go from spending a ¡°few million¡± euros to ¡°billions,¡± he added. ¡°It¡¯s a massive step forward [that] we want to initiate next year.¡±Observers can expect to see some major design choices after those negotiations are complete; for example, whether the next-generation fighter will have one or two seats, Fichefeux said.Airbus¡¯ unmanned aerial systems team has moved forward with efforts related to the remote carrier and manned-unmanned teaming technologies. Jana Rosenmann, the company¡¯s UAS leader, said at the briefing that her team had submitted their proposal for Phase 1B of the FCAS demonstrator portion that is scheduled to begin next year.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe team is studying two remote carrier designs. ¡°We are looking at both a smaller, expendable remote carrier, as well as a larger, conventional-sized remote carrier, looking in the direction of a loyal wingman to fly together with the combat aircraft,¡± Rosenmann said. Airbus is the lead contractor for the remote carrier pillar.The program has some new partners on board, Fichefeux shared Wednesday. In April, Airbus teamed up with the German Ministry of Defence for an eight-month pilot program bringing non-traditional startups and research institutes into the FCAS fold.Eighteen organizations worked on 14 separate program elements, spanning the entire range of technology pillars. Those efforts have led to concrete results, to include a first flight-test-approved launcher of an unmanned aerial system from a transport aircraft; a secure combat cloud demonstrator; and a demonstrator of applied artificial intelligence on radio frequency analysis.These 18 partners could be picked up for subcontracts later on in the program, Fichefeux noted.The plan is to ¡°mature these pilots step by step, and then it could develop into real contracting participation within the FCAS development,¡± he said. ¡°There is a perspective to bring them on board at a later stage.¡±Meanwhile, Airbus also announced Wednesday that its Spanish subsidiary was selected as lead contractor for the low-observability pillar of the program. Airbus Spain will also lead Madrid¡¯s contribution to the next-generation fighter pillar. Indra serves as national lead for the entire program since Spain joined FCAS in early 2020, and also heads the sensor pillar while contributing to the combat cloud and simulations efforts.The finalization of the low-observability contract ¡°completes Spain¡¯s onboarding as an equal nation across all FCAS activities,¡± Airbus said in a release. ¡°The signature closes a ten-month process of onboarding Spain as the third nation.¡±The program will begin testing low-observability technologies early in the demonstrator phase, Fichefeux confirmed. Both the fighter aircraft demonstrator and the remote carrier will have stealth capabilities when they begin flight tests, which are expected as early as 2026. Then the team will need to work on issues such as how to factor in the future engine¡¯s heat signature, and how to integrate sensors and antennae, Fichefeux said. Low-observability ¡°is part of almost all pillars, and the aim of this maturation is to prove¡± what works and what won¡¯t work, he noted.Along with a personal deadline, the FCAS program may also face schedule pressure from Europe¡¯s second sixth-generation fighter program. The United Kingdom, Italy and Sweden have teamed up on the Tempest program, with a current goal of delivering new fighter aircraft to the nations¡¯ militaries by 2035.When asked whether the two fighter programs may converge at some point, Fichefeux noted that that would ultimately be a government decision.¡°That is our responsibility, on the industry side, is just not to lose time waiting,¡± he said. ¡°If the governments want to define a path of convergence, we will support it in due time.¡±",,Vivienne Machi ,2020/12/9,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/12/09/despite-progress-industry-faces-very-tough-roadmap-to-field-fcas-by-2040/
"British F-35 buy is still a moving target, defense ministry tells lawmakers",,"A Marine with Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (VMFA) 211 launches an F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter from the deck aboard Her Majesty's Ship (HMS) Queen Elizabeth at sea on 10 October, 2020. (Photo by 1st Lt. Zachary Bodner, Marine Corps)LONDON ¨C British Ministry of Defence officials have confirmed the military will buy more than the 48 F-35B combat jets already on order, but they were reluctant to be drawn on exactly when and how many aircraft may eventually be involved when they gave evidence to the parliamentary Defence committee Dec 8.The number and profile of a future order will in part be decided by the outcome of assessment work the British are doing on their future combat air strategy, Air Marshal Richard Knighton, the deputy chief of the defense staff for capability, told the committee hearing.¡°We know we need to increase the  number of F-35Bs to support the [Royal Navy] carrier through to its out-of-service date. The precise number will dependent a bit on the work we do and the investment we are making  on the FCAS,¡± he said, referring to the UK-led Tempest program. ¡°We expect to make a definitive judgement around the total future fleet in the 2025 timeframe,¡± Knighton added.Britain originally committed to buy 138 of the Lockheed Martin short take-off vertical landing combat jets to equip a joint force of Royal Navy/Royal Air Force aircraft. The F-35Bs are principally scheduled to equip two new 65,000 tonne aircraft carriers.Knighton said the final number could be up to the 138 commitment, or less. ¡°We need to do the analysis  and work to ensure we get the right number,¡± he told the committee.To date the British have ordered 48 of the jets. So far 21 have been delivered, with the remaining aircraft under contract due to be delivered by 2025.The first of the carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is scheduled to make its first operational deployment next year to the Indian Ocean with a mix of British and U.S. Marine Corps F-35Bs onboard.The British plan to only deploy one carrier at any given time due to a lack of resources. Some 24 jets are expected to be the full complement of fighters on board even though senior Royal Navy officers have said the ships could operate with up to 72 jets at a squeeze.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeKnighton said the British ¡°will be able to operate up to 24 aircaft from 2023 onwards, that¡¯s been the milestone for some time. If we want to order aircraft to be delivered in the later part of the decade we will need to allocate some of the funding that we anticipate [being available] to do that. That is part of the analysis and thinking that we are doing with ministers at the moment.¡±Defence committee chairman Tobias Ellwood commented on the small number of jets the British plan to operate from the carriers, saying: ¡°We are going to end up with a fantastic looking aircraft carrier, very bespoke aircraft, but not many of them onboard.¡±Sir Stephen Lovegrove, the permanent secretary at the MoD, told the committee that while it was certain Britain would order more jets it wouldn¡¯t be anytime soon.¡°It¡¯s inevitable we are going to buy more than 48 jets, otherwise we won¡¯t be able to operate the carriers probably. Not for the next four years, though, it¡¯s about the 48 [jets on order].¡±¡°There are certainly plans and conversation with Lockheed Martin about the future purchases, we just haven¡¯t got to the stage of contract yet,¡± said Lovegrove.The permanent secretary, the MoD¡¯s top civil servant, suggested the aircraft wouldn¡¯t be available quickly even if Britain had the funds to buy them.¡°Even if tomorrow we discover the magic money tree and we decided we wanted to buy 200 F-35B we couldn¡¯t get them just like that anyway. They take forever to manufacture, we will make our orders when they are available,¡± he said.Other take-aways from the committee hearings included MoD permanent secretary Sir Stephen revealing that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is to make a statement soon outlining program cuts ahead of publication of the government¡¯s integrated strategy review set for publication in late January.The government recently announced a ?16 billion increase in MoD funding over the four years starting in April 2021, much of that will go to equipment and other capital programs.Despite that, Lovegrove signaled there were some painful cuts coming to programs that don¡¯t support the government¡¯s swing towards cyber, space , underwater and other high-tech programs and away from legacy platforms.Lovegrove said the time for ¡°sentimentality¡± was over on legacy programs. There were some ¡°difficult decisions to be made¡± in what he termed ¡°disinvestment.¡±Pentagon officials who had been kept informed of British intentions were said to have approved of the British moves.Knighton said a program to update the British Army¡¯s Challenger 2 fleet is due to go the MoD¡¯s investment approvals board in the next few days. The program was in good shape, he said.A reduction in Challenger 2 numbers has been touted by analysts and media as being in the government sights for months.",,Andrew Chuter,2020/12/9,https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2020/12/09/british-f-35-buy-is-still-a-moving-target-defense-ministry-tells-lawmakers/
Counterterrorism setback: ¡®Armed Overwatch¡¯ is stalled again,,"A U.S. Air Force A-10 Thunderbolt II flies a mission over Afghanistan on May 28, 2018. The aircraft provides close-air support for coalition forces fighting terrorist groups. (Staff Sgt. Corey Hook/U.S. Air Force)The Department of Defense requires a cost-effective and responsive method to protect U.S. forces called upon to contain the violent extremist threat while America confronts the reemergence of long-term strategic competition with China and Russia.Yet, despite this essential and ongoing need, a viable, affordable capability to counter the terrorism threat has repeatedly stalled.Post 9/11, the U.S. military developed an effective but expensive methodology for conducting counterterrorism operations by relying on multisource intelligence collection and exploitation, protracted target development, highly mobile strike forces, and the accompanying massed air power necessary to support them.This stacked approach is no longer viable or affordable.Fortunately, there is another, cheaper way ¡ª one that has been tested and validated but not yet aggressively pursued.Here¡¯s how much the US has spent fighting terrorism since 9/11Here¡¯s how much the US has spent fighting terrorism since 9/11Hint: From fiscal 2002 to 2017, the U.S. spent 16 percent of its entire discretionary budget as part of the counterterrorism fight.By: Aaron MehtaIn 2013 and 2015, U.S. Central Command ran a light-attack air experiment called Combat Dragon II. Dubbed ¡°the Phoenix¡± by program managers, given the number of times leadership from military departments and the Joint Staff tried to kill the program, the purpose of CD II was to validate the hypothesis that a properly equipped turboprop aircraft with find, fix and finish capabilities acting in expeditionary direct support could improve interaction and cooperation between air and ground combat forces.This would result in expanded capacity and increased effectiveness of air power in a counterinsurgency or irregular warfare environment, while reducing costs and saving high-end aviation resources currently performing these tasks for other missions.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe CD II experiment was validated by using two 1960s-era OV-10s (twin turboprop light-attack and observation aircraft, known as Broncos) and a blended approach of old and new concepts. Experiments conducted in the United States and as part of combat operations against ISIS in Iraq demonstrated the effectiveness of an open-architecture construct utilizing existing and repurposed communications, sensors, displays and weapons in existing turboprop aircraft.The experiment concluded that rather than employing expensive, high-end, scarce assets to confront the ongoing threat from extremists, an inexpensive, simple, rugged, proliferated and exportable multirole platform could do a better job at a fraction of the cost.Consistent with the National Defense Strategy emphasis on cost-informed and resource-sustainable irregular warfare capabilities, the Defense Department finally supported the CD II follow-on light-attack air experiment, or LAA, in the fiscal 2019 Air Force budget submission as ¡°a viable cost effective capability to counter the violent extremist threat freeing 4th and 5th generation aircraft to face emerging threats.¡±A year later, the Air Force further explained in its FY20 budget justification that ¡°LAA squadrons will provide a deployable and sustainable multirole attack capability, capable of performing a diverse array of attack missions, including but not limited to, Close Air Support, Armed Reconnaissance, Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance (SCAR), Airborne Forward Air control (FAC-A), and interdiction.¡±Despite the justification in the budget submissions, the program languished and the opportunity to save money, while providing an improved capability to U.S. forces performing counterterrorism missions, was squandered.Affirming again that the U.S. continues to engage in low-intensity conflicts in austere environments, and equip partners who face similar threats, the FY21 Defense Department budget proposed moving the program, as ¡°Armed Overwatch,¡± to U.S. Special Operations Command in a new effort to pull it out of its perpetually stalled predicament. But the program has run into yet another delay.In their respective versions of the FY21 defense appropriations and authorization bills, House and Senate defense committees cut funding and imposed additional obstacles for Armed Overwatch.The new administration and Congress should reject the bureaucratic inertia that has stalled a cost-effective solution to provide a find, fix and finish capability to general-purpose and special operations forces.U.S. forces need Congress and the Defense Department to work together to aggressively acquire this effective and affordable approach to the counterterrorism mission.Elaine McCusker is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.

The project is meant to produce a family of uncrewed aerial systems that can move into contested spaces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform.The Air Force announced contract awards Dec. 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in a series of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract.Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:?

Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force¡¯s program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory.One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions.Over the past several months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the ¡°Autonomous Core System,¡± the hardware and software that will enable the Skyborg drone to operate semi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly the system. The system is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors.After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and mission systems being supplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentially supply capabilities for the Skyborg program.In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million to establish a pool of 13 vendors that would compete to offer Skyborg hardware and software ¡ª everything from the drones themselves, to sensors, weapons and algorithms.Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.¡°There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards.

The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here¡¯s what Congress says it will permit.,,"A B-1B Lancer from the 37th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron returns to mission after receiving fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker. (Master Sgt. William Greer/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Congress is seeking to block the Air Force from retiring any of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones this fiscal year.On Dec. 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act ¡ª a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congress sometime next week and will then move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has threatened to veto it.This year¡¯s NDAA contained policy provisions on everything from the Pentagon¡¯s organizational structure to military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would greenlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, which service leaders said would free up funding for modernization priorities that include space technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control).Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retire some bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but they stridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions.Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted to send to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10: Congress¡¯ battles with the Air Force over the venerable A-10 have been legion over the past decade, with the service seeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Force sought a more modest adjustment ¡ª the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about three squadrons worth of aircraft, leaving about 237 Warthogs to fly close-air support missions in the next decade.But Congress put the kibosh on that as well, stipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force¡¯s inventory.Bombers: The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaders said were putting strain on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft ¡ª essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeHowever, lawmakers put several new stipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. The service must place four retired B-1s in storage so that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s that stick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying.ISR fleet: Congress also rejected the Air Force¡¯s plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30 surveillance drones ¡ª a total of 24 aircraft ¡ª which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2 spy plane around to conduct the high-altitude surveillance mission.Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress has stipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defense secretary stating that a better but more expensive capability is in development.Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.¡°The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacy systems,¡± the conference report stated. ¡°However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force¡¯s continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as the service¡¯s failure to comply with current public law.¡±Tankers: The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAA sketches out an alternative plan ¡ª one that forbids any KC-135 retirements over the next three years.Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23.The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft, so the language would allow the service to retire six aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, a source familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language.Cargo planes: The service hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that are set to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, it sets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes.The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets.",,Valerie Insinna,2020/12/4,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/
"Pilots, maintainers are worn out and under-trained, aviation safety commission says",,"Aviation Structural Mechanic (Safety Equipment) 2nd Class Frank McMahon performs maintenance in the cockpit of an F/A-18E Super Hornet. (MC3 Bryan Mai/Navy)A group of aviation experts tasked with getting to the bottom of a surge in deadly military aviation accidents during the last decade came back with its report on Thursday, and there¡¯s a lot that needs fixing.A confluence of cultural issues, budget shortfalls and a lack of oversight have contributed to a general malaise, according to the report, as well as a rash of deadly and costly mishaps from 2013 to 2018: 198 deaths, 157 aircraft destroyed and $9.41 billion lost.Despite finding passionate professionals on flight lines around the world, the heads of the National Commission on Military Aviation Safety told reporters, a lack of flight hours, a stressed supply chain, high operational tempo and administrative distractions have left the community in a bit of disrepair.¡°What we found was that morale was generally degraded,¡± Dick Healing, a retired Coast Guard pilot and vice chairman of NCMAS, told reporters in the morning, before he was due to brief the results of the commission¡¯s investigation to members of the House Armed Services Committee.That period dovetails seamlessly with congressionally-imposed budget sequestration that began in 2013 and was carried on by delayed proper budgets in the following years, but the commission did not blame it entirely on money.Mandated by the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, NCMAS stood up after Military Times investigation found that deadly mishaps rose 40 percent from 2013 to 2018What¡¯s going wrong?Despite recovering that funding, the commission found that aviation units are still not getting enough flight hours, maintenance time and proper parts to keep everything running safely and smoothly, which is a likely contributor to accidents.Sign up for the Early Bird BriefGet the military's most comprehensive news and information every morningEnter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeAbout 43 percent of mishaps are caused by human error, he explained, generally because someone didn¡¯t follow procedure to the letter, or properly coordinate with the other aircrew or those on the ground. Another 38 percent were due to environmental factors, like weather and visibility.The remaining 19 percent were split among organization issues ¨D among those, worn out parts or lack of proper manning ¨D and supervision issues, which include superiors making bad judgment calls or not enforcing policies.Generally, human error is prevented by proficiency ¨D for example, pilots and aircrew with so much recent experience that they are operating on instinct and able to troubleshoot problems with ease.But troops told the NCMAS members they, in many cases, they weren¡¯t getting enough flight hours. In the past, the issue had been budget cuts slashing the amount of time they could afford to be in the air.Now, according to retired Army Gen. Dick Cody, NCMAS chairman it¡¯s more an issue of prioritizing.Some young pilots are coming out of schoolhouses that lean heavily on hours in a simulator. That¡¯s great for practicing emergency procedures, he said, but not for gaining proficiency in the aircraft.So in order to get them up to speed, their first units of assignment are spending flight hours closing that gap, rather than spreading them more evenly up through more experienced pilots.And that, in turn, is resulting in more waivers, or units making exceptions for pilots assigned to missions who are about to fall out of balance with the required number of flight hours they need every 60 days.¡°We shouldn¡¯t have pilots being tasked to do missions that have been waivered,¡± Cody said, adding that there have been ¡°way too many accidents right on the 60-day current limit, and they¡¯re out there flying a mission.¡±Marines prepare for takeoff at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Ariz. (Lance Cpl. Ashley McLaughlin/Marine Corps)Military aviation mishaps and deaths are declining for the first time in yearsThe military is bringing down aviation mishap numbers, but dangerous and deadly crashes still plague the services.Meghann MyersWhile mishaps in general were down in 2019, the Navy and Marine Corps saw individual increases, including a 30-percent increase in the Corps.The commission isn¡¯t sure what caused that spike, Cody said, adding that the service is, anecdotally, ¡°about as a stressed as any of the services that we saw¡± during their visits to 200 units across 80 installations over the past year and a half.¡°We didn¡¯t seen any new [types of] accidents,¡± he added, explaining that the most common causes of mishaps have largely remained the same.But he did call out the physical conditions of the Marine Corps aviation community, which has been seen as taking a backseat to its other organizations.¡°And some of their facilities were not facilities that we would want young Americans maintaining multi-million dollar aircraft [in],¡± Cody said.How to fix the problemWhile the report calls for cultural change and budget predictability, two factors that can¡¯t be remedied with the snap of a finger, it does lay out several institutional changes that can happen right away.Cody¡¯s top recommendation is to start tracking those flight waivers, so that the services know just how common it is for borderline-current pilots to get in the cockpit and those trends can be traced.Along those same lines, Healing made a plug to create a joint safety council within the defense secretary¡¯s office, reporting directly to the deputy defense secretary, as an authority to centrally track aviation trends, factors and data that can be fed directly to high-level policy and funding decisions.Such a council ¡°basically gives them the information they need in order to make decisions that can seriously impact aviation safety,¡± Healing said.Other remedies will require institutional motivation.The report focuses heavily on the grinding combination of being overworked, untrained and under-incentivized.The commission recommends increasing the ceiling on pilot retention bonuses to $100,000 per year. It also recommends boosting manning levels of administrative personnel in aviation units, so that pilots and maintainers don¡¯t get sucked into doing paperwork rather than focusing on their intricate skill sets, which they have reported as a problem.OPTEMPO a lingering issueBut the last part of the equation might be more difficult to tackle, as combatant commanders continue to request forces. The relentless demand for aviation units to support operations around the world, as they¡¯re becoming more and more strained, is a recipe for disaster, both in safety but also retention of pilots and maintainers.For example, carrier air wing deployments have stretched from the long-standing six-month underway to nine months or beyond ¨D and in the case of the aircraft carriers Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, having only a few months at home before heading out again.In the Army, downsized aviation brigades are doing back-to-back rotations in Korea and Europe.

The US Air Force wants to buy a big robot to help with bomb disposal,,"EOD experts from Mountain Home Air Force Base visit the Ford Center in Idaho during the Robot Convention on March 29, 2019. This event was held to showcase the abilities of robotics. (Senior Airman Tyrell Hall/U.S. Air Force)UPDATE ¡ª This story has been updated to add comment from L3Harris on its participation in the competition.WASHINGTON ¡ª A year after the U.S. Army awarded a contract to build a heavy-duty robot able to dispose of bombs and other explosives, the Air Force is looking for its own system ¡ª and it wants to see what¡¯s on the market before committing to purchasing what the Army buys.The Air Force in October released a solicitation for a large explosive ordnance disposal robot, a commercial off-the-shelf system equipped with a maneuverable arm and a camera system that can function in all terrain types, environments and weather conditions.An Air Force spokesman declined to confirm how many companies submitted bids for the program, which were due Nov. 20.One competitor has already come forward: FLIR, which is set to rake in as much as $109 million building its Kobra robot for the Army¡¯s Common Robotic System-Heavy program. The company began full-rate production of Kobra last month and is confident the Air Force will follow the Army¡¯s example by choosing the same system.¡°As the chosen provider for the Army¡¯s Common Robotic System-Heavy (CRS-H) program, FLIR believes its extensively tested and proven unmanned ground system meets the Air Force needs in the large EOD robot category, while enabling commonality of equipment with other services¡¯ EOD forces,¡± said Tom Frost, who runs FLIR¡¯s unmanned ground systems business.QinetiQ, which lost out to FLIR in the CRS-H competition, did not respond to a query about whether it had bid on the Air Force program.An L3Harris spokesperson confirmed to Defense News that it had submitted its T7 EOD robot to the Air Force competition. L3Harris said it wanted to be chosen for the CRS-H program in 2018. The company unveiled the robot at the Association of the US Army¡¯s annual conference in 2016 letting show attendees take a crack at operating the arm on the robot. The controller looks like the back end of a gun making it easy to hold, and is hooked to sensors that transfer information to the robotic arm on the T7.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeThe United Kingdom is a customer of the T7 for EOD missions.At times, the Air Force has joined Army robot programs without needing to hold a competition. But in the case of larger EOD robots, the two services have differing requirements that have led the Air Force to seek out its own system instead of jumping into the CRS-H program, said S. Chase Cooper, a contracting officer who is managing the EOD robot solicitation on behalf of the Air Force¡¯s 772nd Enterprise Sourcing Squadron.¡°The major difference is that the Army¡¯s mission is primarily to operate ¡®outside the wire¡¯ ¡± ¡ª that is, outside of a secure military installation ¡ª ¡°where the Air Force¡¯s mission is primarily ¡®inside the wire.¡¯ These are two entirely different environments,¡± he said in a statement to Defense News.Cooper also pointed to additional considerations such as the size and weight of the system.Most Air Force EOD missions occur after bombs or other improvised explosive devices are found at a base or installation. When that happens, teams load robots and other gear into a Base Response Vehicle or Bomb Squad Emergency Response Vehicle, drive out to the location of the explosive device, and safely dispose of the explosive. Whatever robot the Air Force chooses must be small enough to fit inside those vehicles, Cooper said. That includes passing through a 32-inch-wide door opening and parking into a space 91 inches long and 63 inches high.The Air Force¡¯s requirement for weight, which is set at a maximum of 1,000 pounds, is less stringent than the Army¡¯s 700-pound limit. The Air Force also called for a system with a minimum 800-meter, line-of-sight radio range, and a 3-hour runtime that will allow it complete the majority of EOD missions.Cooper noted that the Air Force¡¯s decision to pursue an open competition does not preclude the FLIR robot from being chosen by the service.¡°It is unknown at this time if that system would meet our requirements,¡± Cooper said. ¡°Through our contracting process, we are evaluating all of the proposed large robot systems against the Air Force¡¯s requirement so we can make sure the system we purchase is the best one for our airmen.¡±The Air Force has a history of both collaborating with the Army on EOD robots and going its own way. For its medium-sized unmanned ground vehicle, the Air Force opted to use the Army¡¯s existing contract under the Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II program for FLIR¡¯s Centaur UGV, which is also being purchased by the Navy and Marine Corps.But while QinetiQ beat out FLIR in the Army¡¯s competition for CRS-Individual ¡ª a man-packable robot that is less than 25 pounds ¡ª the Air Force ended up pursuing a separate contract to meet its own unique needs for small unmanned ground vehicles.",,Valerie Insinna and Jen Judson ,2020/12/3,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/03/the-air-force-wants-to-buy-a-big-robot-to-help-with-bomb-disposal/
Boeing starts production of T-7 training jet simulators,,"A Boeing test pilot flies the T-7A ground-based flight simulator. (Boeing)WASHINGTON ¡ª Boeing has begun production of the first T-7A ground-based training systems, preparing the way for the company to make its first deliveries in 2023.Workers at Boeing¡¯s plant in St. Louis, Missouri, are currently assembling the first two weapon systems trainers and one operational flight trainer, the company said in a news release Tuesday. Those assets will be among the first simulators the company expects to deliver to Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, in 2023.The high-fidelity simulators include 8K native projectors that supports imagery that is 16 times the clarity of high-definition video, and the crew stations are equipped with motion seats that simulate the sensation of flight, Boeing stated.The ground-based trainers will be able to connect to a physical T-7A, meaning that pilots virtually training can team up with those performing live flights in the T-7 aircraft. Because the simulators were built with an open-architecture backbone, it can be easily modified with new software applications.¡°The Red Hawk¡¯s training system is arguably the most advanced in the world. It¡¯s a game changer,¡± said Chuck Dabundo, Boeing¡¯s vice president of the T-7 programs. ¡°This system is 100% integrated with the pilot¡¯s real-world experience, offering ¡®real-as-it-gets¡¯ simulation. We¡¯re working closely with the U.S. Air Force and look forward to testing and fielding the devices.¡±In 2018, Boeing won the $9.2 billion contract for the T-X program after submitting a bid that shaved about $10 billion off the Air Force¡¯s initial estimates. The indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract allows the Air Force to buy up to 475 aircraft and 120 simulators, although the current plan is to buy 351 T-7 aircraft, 46 simulators and associated ground equipment.Under the initial $813 million award, Boeing will deliver five T-7 aircraft and seven simulators.Initial operating capability is planned by the end of fiscal 2024 when the first squadron of T-7A aircraft and its associated simulators are all available for training.

A new design is almost ready for the KC-46¡äs most troubled system,,"Once the Remote Vision System is overhauled, the KC-46 will be cleared for combat operations. (Staff Sgt. Victoria Nelson/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force and Boeing have almost finalized a new design of the problem-plagued system that must be overhauled before the KC-46 tanker is ready for combat operations, the service¡¯s acquisition executive said Nov. 24.Unlike legacy tankers, where boom operators look out a window and rely on line-of-sight visual cues to guide the refueling boom into a receiver aircraft, KC-46 boomers use a series of cameras and sensors called the Remote Vision System. After years of disagreements between the Air Force and KC-46 prime contractor Boeing about whether the current RVS met requirements, the parties in April agreed to replace the original system with a completely redesigned ¡°RVS 2.0.¡±¡°We¡¯ve completed nearly every aspect of the design except the actual projection method,¡± Will Roper, the Air Force¡¯s assistant secretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, said during a roundtable with reporters last week.The Air Force is considering two different options to project the images from the tanker¡¯s rear camera system to the boom operators who sit at the front of the aircraft: a collimated mirror design, which uses a curved mirror to project a wide field of view to the user, and an LCD-type screen similar to modern televisions.Roper characterized the difference between the two methods as ¡°a hyper-stereo system¡± that would deliver near-perfect optics versus ¡°a more mature technology¡± with less risk.¡°Once they¡¯ve selected that final projection method, the rest of the design is complete, so we¡¯ll be ready to go ahead and start building a laboratory system,¡± Roper said. ¡°Every component that we would install on the jet, we¡¯ll just do that on the ground, and that would give us a lot of confidence that when we install the jet itself, that it will work as advertised.¡±The Air Force plans to buy at least 179 KC-46s, with the first tanker accepted by the service in January 2019. Boeing agreed to take total financial responsibility for developing the new RVS system, cutting the new design into the production line and modifying tankers already delivered to the Air Force.So far, the company has delivered more than 30 KC-46s to the service, which all must receive a retrofit service.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeAs a short-term stopgap, Boeing offered an enhanced version of the current RVS system to the Air Force in order to bridge the gap before RVS 2.0 comes online in 2023 or 2024.If the service ultimately chose to move forward with the so-called RVS 1.5, Boeing could start incorporating those upgrades in the second half of 2021, according to Mike Hafer, the company¡¯s KC-46 global sales lead, who spoke during a briefing in September.But Roper stressed that ¡°it¡¯s really 2.0 that has the lion¡¯s share of our attention.¡±The Air Force completed its assessment of the enhanced system this fall. While there are ¡°a few capabilities¡± that the service will cut into the baseline system, Roper said that none of the improvements are ¡°earth-shattering¡± or have changed the Air Force¡¯s view that a newly designed system is needed to meet requirements.",,Valerie Insinna,2020/11/30,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/11/30/a-new-design-is-almost-ready-for-the-kc-46s-most-troubled-system/
Aircraft makers sweeten their offers in high-stakes Swiss warplane race,,"A Swiss Air Force F/A-18 is seen in front of a church on Feb. 20, 2013, at Payerne airport. The Swiss government is expected to make a decision in 2021 about the aircraft type to replace the aging fleet. (Fabrice Croffrini/AFP)COLOGNE, Germany, and WASHINGTON ¡ª Four aircraft makers have submitted final offers for Switzerland¡¯s $6.5 billion aircraft program, with Airbus and Lockheed Martin touting different approaches to assembling their planes locally.Nov. 18 was the deadline for the quartet of hopeful vendors, which also includes Boeing and Dassault, to deliver their vision ¡ª and price ¡ª for one of the largest procurement programs in Europe.Switzerland is looking for somewhere between 36 and 40 new aircraft to police the country¡¯s airspace. The degree of local industry participation is shaping up to be a major factor for the famously independence-minded Swiss.Airbus got an assist from four Eurofighter operators ¡ª Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K. ¡ª who sent their ambassadors in Switzerland to a Nov. 19 news conference to talk up the prospect of a grander industrial and political partnership that would follow a Eurofighter pick.The Swiss are expected to make a decision in early summer 2021, following a referendum vote this September that narrowly greenlighted the budget.The Airbus offer includes final assembly of all aircraft by way of a partner company in Switzerland, the details of which the company plans to announce in December.Michael Fl¨¹gger, Germany¡¯s ambassador in Switzerland, touted the possibility of Eurofighter-based airspace-patrol cooperation along the Italy-Switzerland-Germany axis. In addition, he said, Switzerland joining the airplane¡¯s user club would mean the country can ¡°export¡± training flight noise to remote areas in the other partner countries.Franz Posch, who heads the Airbus campaign in Switzerland, told reporters that the company¡¯s plan to locally assemble all 40 of the notional aircraft would ¡°more than fulfill¡± the offset requirements established by the Swiss government.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeLockheed Martin, with its F-35, also has high hopes for the Swiss competition, hoping to broaden the plane¡¯s user base in Europe. The company¡¯s offer includes a basic program of 36 jets, with options for an additional four aircraft, Mike Kelley, who leads the company¡¯s F-35 efforts in Switzerland, said during a Nov. 19 roundtable with reporters.While Switzerland would be able to purchase parts through the spares pool shared by all F-35 operators, the offer also contains a six-month deployed spares package ¡ª a separate pot of parts that would be managed by the Swiss government, which was necessary to meet Swiss autonomy requirements.To meet requirements for industrial participation, Switzerland would have the opportunity to domestically produce about 400 canopies and transparencies for F-35 aircraft, and Lockheed would establish a European hub for the maintenance, repair and overhaul of F 35 canopies and transparencies in Switzerland. In addition, the country would take on certain F-35 engine and airframe sustainment projects focused on maintaining the Swiss Air Force¡¯s operational autonomy, Kelley said.Lockheed also plans to partner with Swiss industry to create a cyber center of excellence, which would prototype a unique data network for Switzerland and build a test bed that would allow Swiss companies to test cyber capabilities in a secure environment.On top of those efforts, Lockheed is offering one last industrial participation opportunity to Switzerland. For an additional cost, Switzerland will be able to conduct the final assembly of four F-35 aircraft at existing RUAG facilities in Emmen, allowing the Swiss technicians that currently work on the country¡¯s aging Hornet fleet to build a deeper knowledge of the aircraft¡¯s design.That option would add a ¡°significant cost¡± to the total program, Kelley said, but could allow for overall savings throughout the life cycle of the program.Boeing, meanwhile, has positioned its offer of an F-18 Super Hornet fleet as a logical extension of Switzerland¡¯s existing F-18 infrastructure. ¡°As an F/A-18 operator, Switzerland will have the option to reuse up to 60 percent of existing physical and intellectual infrastructure, making the transition to a Super Hornet easier and more cost effective over the life of the aircraft,¡± the company said in a statement.The aircraft offer, the statement added, would ¡°easily fit¡± within Switzerland¡¯s current F-18 operating budget.The reference to cost comes after Swiss officials stressed that the fighter portion of the Air 2030 air defense modernization program includes a cost ceiling of 6 billion Swiss francs (U.S. $6.6 billion), with with an eye on potential price reductions along the way.¡°Currently, Boeing is working with more than 100 current and new partners across Switzerland to identify the right opportunities for its New Fighter Aircraft industry plan,¡± the company said.France¡¯s Dassault, with its offer of the Rafale, is the only vendor keeping its cards close to its chest.

House Democrats see political motive in Air Force decision to base C-130s in Georgia,,"A C130 with the 136th Air Lift Wing, Texas Air National Guard, sit on the flight line as personnel depart at Volk Field Air National Guard Base during PATRIOT North 19 on July 12, 2019 in Camp Douglas, Wis. (Master Sgt. Kellen Kroening/U.S. Air National Guard)WASHINGTON ¡ª Three top Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee are taking the Air Force to task over a decision to base new C-130Js in Georgia, a move they contend could influence the state¡¯s upcoming Senate runoff races.On Nov. 24, the Air Force selected four Air National Guard bases to receive 24 C-130J cargo planes, including Savannah Air National Guard Base in Georgia.But House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., raised concerns that the Air Force is ¡°playing politics¡± by announcing its decision so close to the runoff elections ¡ª especially since the service initially planned on selecting only three locations and Congress has not yet funded enough aircraft to be stationed a fourth site.¡°In this instance, the timing and decision to include Savannah, GA in the announcement, when Georgia is focused on Senate runoff elections, raises questions about the Secretary¡¯s motives,¡± Smith said in a statement.¡°The Air Force did not need to make this decision now ¡ª plain and simple ¡ª and should delay moving forward with these basing actions until conference negotiations have concluded and the decision is not at risk of being politicized,¡± he said. ¡°If the Air Force plods ahead, the service runs the risk of undermining the strategic basing process and may force Congress to take action to protect the basing process from being used to potentially influence congressional action or election outcomes.¡±However, the Air Force maintains that its decision was motivated by efficiency, not politics.¡°Since the Air Force is aware the House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill include additional C-130Js, the Air Force can leverage the exhaustive work already accomplished on the current C-130J basing process for a fourth location, Savannah Air National Guard Base,¡± said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. ¡°Naming the preferred alternatives now allows us to move forward with the environmental impact process without delay, enabling the timely beddown of these C-130Js.¡±The Air Force first notified Congress in March that it planned to select three Air National Guard bases to host new C-130J aircraft.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeThe service considered eight installations: Bradley Air Guard Station in Connecticut, Peoria Air Guard Station in Illinois, Louisville Air Guard Base in Kentucky, Great Falls Air Guard Station in Montana, Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth in Texas, McLaughlin Air National Guard Base in West Virginia, Cheyenne Air Guard Station in Wyoming, and the Georgia location.But as the Air Force neared its decision this fall, certain lawmakers grew concerned that the service was no longer staying true to its selection criteria, which would have prioritized bases that could host the aircraft without the need for expensive upgrades.Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., who chairs HASC¡¯s seapower and projection forces subcommittee, said he shared those concerns during phone calls with Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown, and Air National Guard director Lt. Gen. Michael Loh.Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) walks with aides on Capitol Hill on February 14, 2018 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Aaron P.

He called for the decision to be reversed and postponed.¡°The questionable timing and irregular process has undermined my confidence that this decision was made objectively and without political influence,¡± Garamendi said in a statement. ¡°I strongly urge the Air Force to rescind this decision and delay this announcement until January. Doing so will allow the Air Force to make its decision until after conference negotiations have been completed and remove itself from the Georgia runoffs and other politically charged circumstances.¡±Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican whose fate rests on the results of the runoffs in January, immediately hailed the basing decision and pointed to his own work trying to garner additional resources for the state¡¯s military installations, which include Robins Air Force Base and Fort Benning.¡°This is extremely exciting news for Savannah¡¯s airmen and the entire coastal community,¡± said Perdue, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ¡°We¡¯ve made it a top priority to modernize and upgrade military equipment in order to preserve our competitive advantage around the world, and the 165th Airlift Wing is a critical component of that effort.¡±Perdue was forced into a Jan. 5 runoff with Democrat Jon Ossoff after neither candidate received 50 percent of the vote during the elections earlier this month.

Stop the budgetary bleeding to get the Air Force we need,,"The time has come to openly articulate what is required to meet national security requirements, this commentary's author argues. (Staff Sgt. Renee Jackson/U.S. Air Force)In 2018, then-Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson sounded the alarm regarding the size of her service: ¡°The Air Force is too small for what the nation expects of us.¡± Her response was direct: The service needed to grow from 312 to 386 operational squadrons.Given the concurrent demands presented by China and Russia at the high end of the threat spectrum, Iran and North Korea in the middle, and the continued danger posed by nonstate actors at the lower threat tier, this imperative for growth was grounded in clear requirements. However, instead of marking a positive turning point for the service, subsequent years saw the Air Force grow smaller, older and more fragile.The burgeoning security environment demands that this downward spiral end now. This is exactly why the Senate¡¯s version of the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act includes specific aircraft inventory floors for the Air Force. With positive intentions having fallen short year after year, it is time for legislation to stop the bleeding.No form of power projection is possible without the capabilities afforded by the Air Force. Ships at sea, forces on land and rear echelon operating locations will not survive long if not defended from aerial attack. Long-range strike affords the unique ability to hit critical targets deep behind enemy lines. Air mobility empowers joint force operations. Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance was the most in-demand mission area over the past two decades, and remains so today. Added to this, the Air Force also provides two-thirds of the nuclear triad.Despite the value provided by these missions, the Air Force has struggled to earn its fair share of the defense budget. It absorbed the largest fiscal cuts out of all the services in the years after the Cold War. Between 1989 and 2001, the Air Force saw procurement funding drop by over 52 percent ¡ª nearly 20 percent more than the other services. FY13 saw aircraft procurement funding hit the lowest levels in Air Force history.Top US Air Force general wants to go faster, but the biggest changes won¡¯t happen for another yearTop US Air Force general wants to go faster, but the biggest changes won¡¯t happen for another yearThe Air Force's fiscal 2022 budget will include only modest changes to its aircraft inventory, according to Gen. Charles Q. Brown.By: Valerie InsinnaTo add insult to injury, the Air Force also sees nearly 20 percent of its top-line budget diverted to the intelligence community ¡ª enough money to buy over 400 F-35 fighter jets a year. No other service gets hit like this.With budget pressures a perennial problem, the Air Force has continually sought to divest aircraft to free up cash. The problem is that the demand for Air Force missions never went away. Quite the opposite, it increased. In 1990, the Air Force had 2,893 fighters; today it has around 1,800. This same period saw bombers drop from 327 to 157. Combat operations have been unending since 1991, which means a smaller number of aircraft and crews simply get spun harder to meet demand.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThis is an unsustainable pattern, with the B-1B bomber standing as a cautionary tale. It has been flying combat missions on a nonstop basis since the 9/11 attacks. The Air Force retired a third of the B-1B inventory in the 2000s to save money that could be reinvested in the remaining aircraft. Budget pressures in subsequent years saw these savings evaporate, maintenance dollars run too thin and the aircraft pressed to the limit. They hit the breaking point last year, with less than 10 percent of the Air Force¡¯s B-1Bs mission-capable.With nearly every mission area in the Air Force inventory labeled as ¡°high demand, low density,¡± expect to see similar challenges proliferate. These stresses are also a major driver behind the pilot crisis.Shrinking the Air Force in the hopes that expected savings could fund modernization has served as a continual mirage for Air Force planners. Indeed, the Air Force¡¯s answer to funding the Advanced Battle Management System and other priorities in the FY21 budget submission was to retire more aircraft. Better networks are of little use without the ability to complete the kill chain, and that takes aircraft. Presumed areas of growth hang precariously years into the future. There¡¯s little chance that cash will remain protected given COVID-19 budget pressures.The problem is that even when divestiture plans appear plausible on internal spreadsheets, service officials are not the ultimate arbiters of their resources. The broader Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, and Congress each have a vote on how funds are managed. This pattern clearly has not worked for the Air Force for the past 30 years. Playing this losing hand again will break the force at fundamental levels.That is why the Senate¡¯s proposed aircraft floor is not just a good idea ¡ª it is a necessity. A prudent negotiator does not enter a meeting with a high-risk position as the starting point, but that is exactly what the Air Force has done for far too long. The time has come to openly articulate what is required to meet national security requirements. That is what the 386 operational squadron goal is all about. It comes down to acknowledging what airmen will need to fly into harm¡¯s way, get the job done and come home safe. This takes both capability and capacity.

"To bring ABMS over the finish line, US Air Force turns to the office responsible for stealth bombers and space planes",,"Tech. Sgt. John Rodiguez patrols with a Ghost Robotics Vision 60 prototype at a simulated austere base during the Advanced Battle Management System exercise on Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., on Sept. 3, 2020. (Airman First Class Zachary Rufus/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force office responsible for the development of the B-21 bomber and X-37 space plane has been handed the reins of the Advanced Battle Management System program, the service¡¯s top acquisition official announced Nov. 24.The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office will now share responsibilities for developing the ABMS with the service¡¯s chief architect, Preston Dunlap. That will pave the way for the service to begin buying the system¡¯s first elements as early as next year, Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper told reporters during a roundtable Tuesday.Originally envisioned as a replacement for Air Force platforms like the E-8C JSTARS ground surveillance plane, ABMS has evolved into an Internet of Things for the military ¡ª a sprawling family of IT and communications gear meant to seamlessly connect the aircraft, sensors and other weapons systems.For the past year, the Air Force has focused ABMS efforts on a series of on-ramp exercises meant to bring industry to the table and test whether off-the-shelf technology ¡ª everything from SpaceX¡¯s Starlink constellation to artificial intelligence systems ¡ª could plug into the military¡¯s existing platforms and provide better awareness of a battlespace.Having proven that the technologies are available and work, the next step is to create a concrete plan to acquire them, Roper said.¡°It¡¯s a pretty no-brainer thing,¡± he said. ¡°ABMS is ready for a program executive office.¡±According to a memo sent from Roper to the Air Force¡¯s acquisition workforce Tuesday, the chief architect will remain responsible for codifying ABMS¡¯ technical requirements, overseeing on-ramp exercises, and approving the overall architecture and digital standards for the system.Meanwhile, the Rapid Capabilities Office program executive has been tasked with conducting an audit of the program over the next 90 days, which will detail all efforts, contracts and resources associated with ABMS. That will inform the ABMS acquisition strategy, where the program office will lay out what it plans to buy and when that tech will be procured.Know all the coolest acronymsSign up for the C4ISRNET newsletter about future battlefield technologies.Enter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeMost importantly, the RCO will have the difficult job of making trade-offs that impact legacy platforms, program offices and companies that span across the Air Force¡¯s different mission areas, Roper said.¡°It is the reality of this business that we are handed a budget that we don¡¯t make, and we have to do our best job executing it. Rarely is there all the money that we said we needed to get the job done, so we prioritize across different programs,¡± he said.¡°The thing I¡¯m going to be looking to the RCO to do is ensure that we deliver usable, internet-type capabilities to the joint force and not more partial capabilities that don¡¯t add up to the same operational effect,¡± he said. ¡°I would rather have 70 percent of ABMS completed at [a] 100 percent level and be ready to be used operationally, than 100 percent of ABMS completed at a 70 percent level.¡±The Air Force views ABMS as pivotal for executing the military¡¯s Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept, which seeks to link all of the military services¡¯ sensors and shooters. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown listed the program as his second-most important modernization priority, during an interview this month with Defense News.However, Congress has been more reticent to buy into the program, raising concerns about the service¡¯s lack of an acquisition strategy and detailed requirements.That the RCO will now delineate a more thorough acquisition plan for ABMS is a ¡°happy coincidence,¡± Roper said, though he expects it will help alleviate some of Congress¡¯ concerns about the program.¡°I¡¯m not getting questions about how is the Air Force possibly going to build the internet,¡± he said. ¡°I¡¯m really getting: ¡®Let¡¯s talk about your baselines. Let¡¯s talk about all of your documentation.¡¯ That is a wonderful next set of questions to have.¡±Roper expects that lawmakers will get onboard the ABMS program once the Air Force starts buying new capabilities ¡ª things like new radios, data fusion systems and mesh networks ¡ª and then consolidating the technologies inside pods and installing them on legacy aircraft. That could occur as early as next year.So what platforms will likely receive modifications first? Roper said aerial refueling tankers ¡ª one model in particular ¡ª ¡°might get to the goal line first.¡±Once a tanker is a part of ABMS, ¡°you can start talking about what¡¯s its smart device function, meaning what does it do aside from its day job.

Indra will work together with French company Thales and German industry consortium FCMS to design and develop the ¡°connected and distributed architecture of sensors¡± to provide situational awareness, and boost platform survivability, the company said in a release.The contract details a one-year period for the team to design the sensor packages as part of the larger program¡¯s Phase 1A concept study, and could be extended for an additional six months. Phase 1A was launched this past February and will last for about 18 months, per program officials.While much of the details surrounding the sensors remains to be seen after the design phase is complete, the three organizations involved said the suite will contribute to the FCAS and next-generation weapon system¡¯s situational awareness ¡°and ability to operate without being detected.¡±The advanced sensor suite is one of seven technology ¡°pillars¡± that encompass the Future Combat Air System program, along with a sixth-generation fighter jet, advanced ¡°remote carrier¡± drones, a new jet engine, a next-generation weapon system, stealth technology, and an air combat cloud system. ¡°The sensors pillar consortium looks forward to working together with the other NGWS/FCAS pillars in order to optimize the design and integration of the sensors within the system and platforms,¡± the three organizations said in the release.The FCAS program is led by Airbus and Dassault Aviation, with Indra leading Spain¡¯s industry participation. Madrid joined the program earlier this year, nearly three years after France and Germany jointly announced plans to build a new fighter jet and other advanced technologies. The teams are currently working in tandem on the Joint Concept Study phase and the Phase 1A demonstrator effort, both expected to culminate around summer 2021.Initial demonstrators for the fighter aircraft and next-generation weapon system are expected by 2026, with the full development program expected to start in 2027.

"US Air Force to reorganize network, security groups under single entity",,"The better teams understand how the network is built and configured, the better they can defend it, the argument goes. (Capt. Krystal Jimenez/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The Air Force is collapsing some of its groups within the 688th Cyberspace Wing to build a network and security operations cell.This spring, the service is conducting an experiment in which it will collapse the 690th Cyberspace Operations Group ¡ª focused on network operations ¡ª the 26th Cyber Operations Group ¡ª focused on security operations ¡ª and the 38th Cyberspace Engineering Installation Group into a single entity, according to Col. Joshua Rockhill, commander of the 26th Cyberspace Operations Group, who spoke Nov. 18 during a virtual presentation as part of an AFCEA Alamo chapter conference.The effort aims to create a greater unity of effort between those operating the network and those defending the network, which under the previous construct fell under different groups. The better teams understand how the network is built and configured, the better they can defend it, the argument goes.¡°We¡¯re doing that not only with the legacy network today but also thinking about with an eye on the future as we build out our [IT-as-a-service] environment ¡ª through an organizing construct and interact with our industry partners that maybe providing some of those services to us,¡± Brig.

Lt. Gen. Timothy Haugh, commander of 16th Air Force, which oversees the 688th Cyberspace Wing, said the reorganization is designed to flatten response times to incidents.Rockhill added that the new group will be the lead security incident integrator at the tactical level partnering with the local network defenders to ingest alerts and generate responses. He noted the idea is these responses will be automated in order to keep humans on human tasks and machines on machine tasks.¡°Our sense is [the reorganization] will be a significant improvement, but the experiment will bear the out,¡± Rockhill said. ¡°We think this approach across people, process and tech is going to help the 688th Cyber Wing do its part to enable a digital future.¡±",,"Mark Pomerleau

Here¡¯s how bad the military¡¯s aircraft readiness has gotten,,"Lightning strikes behind a B-1B Lancer parked on the flight line as a major storm approaches Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. in May 2017. The B-1B was at Tinker undergoing depot level maintenance and had been stripped of the majority of its paint. (Greg L. Davis/Air Force)For years, the military¡¯s critics have raised alarms about its aircraft readiness, and whether concerning numbers of airplanes and helicopters have not been ready to fly.A new report from the Government Accountability Office released Thursday shows just how bad the problem has gotten ¡ª not just in the Air Force, but also in the Navy, Marine Corps and Army.In the report, which was requested by Congress, GAO said that it studied readiness rates for 46 aircraft across those four services between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2019. Of those, only three met their annual mission-capable goals for a majority of those years: The Navy¡¯s EP-3E Aries II and E-6B Mercury and the Air Force¡¯s UH-1N Huey helicopter. The EP-3 hit seven of its annual goals, the E-6B hit it during five years, and the UH-1N met its goal during all nine years.Even more concerning, 24 of the aircraft GAO reviewed never met their annual goals once in that nine-year span.The average annual mission-capable rates for selected Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps aircraft decreased overall since 2011, according to the GAO. The average mission-capable rate for the selected Army aircraft slightly increased.Mission-capable rates are the percentage of total time when an aircraft can fly and perform at least one mission, GAO said, and is one of the key metrics used to assess the health and readiness of an aircraft fleet.Readiness problems are especially worrisome because the Defense Department spends tens of billions of dollars each year to sustain weapon systems such as aircraft. Of all the costs a weapon system will incur during its entire life cycle, operating and support costs ¡ª including spare parts, depot and field maintenance, personnel and engineering support ¡ª typically account for about 70 percent of those expenses.An AH-64 Apache attack helicopter from 1-3rd Attack Reconnaissance Battalion, 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, re-arms and refuels during aerial gunnery training at Grafenwohr Training Area in Germany on July 20.

Of the 46 aircraft reviewed, 19 were more than 15 percentage points below the readiness goals set by their services, including 11 that were 25 percentage points or more below-goal. Another 18 aircraft were anywhere from six to 15 percentage points below their goals.Gen. Charles Q. Brown, nominated for reappointment to the grade of general and to chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, testifies during a Senate Armed Services Committee nomination hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Kevin Dietsch/AP)US Air Force bails on Mattis-era fighter jet readiness goalOne of the Air Force's fighters had a lower mission-capable rate in 2019 than the year prior.Valerie Insinna and Stephen LoseyGAO focused on manned fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft supporting combat-related missions, but did not review other aircraft focusing on other missions such as training or moving high-priority passengers or cargo.There are a variety of complicating factors hurting the military¡¯s ability to keep its least-ready airplanes in the air, GAO¡¯s report said.The Air Force¡¯s B-1B Lancer bomber, for example ¡ª one of the planes that never met its goals ¡ª is aging and has had its service life extended. The B-1 is also dealing with unscheduled maintenance, and a shortage of and delay in acquiring spare parts that worsens a maintenance backlog, GAO said.During his nomination hearing last August, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. John Hyten told lawmakers that just six of the Air Force¡¯s 62 B-1s were mission-capable at that time. Hyten said in the hearing that deployment after deployment was ¡°just beating the heck out of¡± the B-1, leaving dozens either in depots for maintenance or otherwise down for other problems or inspections. The B-1 was also grounded in 2018 over problems with its ejection seats, and again in 2019.The Air Force¡¯s C-5M Super Galaxy, C-130J Super Hercules and F-22 Raptor are also facing problems with the unexpected need for repairs and parts replacement, unscheduled maintenance and parts shortages and delays. Some of the manufacturers who make or supply spare parts needed by the C-130J and F-22 are drying up, and some parts used by the C-130J are becoming obsolete and unavailable.The Navy¡¯s F/A-18E and F Super Hornet is also struggling with a service life extension, unexpected repairs and parts replacements, delays in depot maintenance and a shortage of trained maintainers and supply shortages. And the Marine Corps¡¯ MV-22B Osprey faces unexpected parts replacements, a lack of access to technical data needed for maintenance, not enough maintainers, and parts shortages.The F-35 Lightning II¡¯s rates trended downward from fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018, GAO said, before improving slightly in 2019. Overall, the F-35 recorded an increase in mission-capable rates from fiscal 2012 to 2019.The other Air Force aircraft, in addition to the B-1, that never met their readiness goals in any of the nine years were the C-17 Globemaster III, the C-130J, the F-15C/D Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-22 Raptor and the CV-22 Osprey.A U.S. Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 11, deployed from the aircraft carrier Harry S.

While there was some improvement, the services never met that goal, and it has since been quietly dropped.An MV-22 Osprey prepares for takeoff during integration training between Amphibious Squadron 4 and 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima Oct. 28.

US Air Force sets sights on new spectrum warfare wing,,"Air Force officials provided the most detailed description to date regarding its forthcoming spectrum warfare wing. (Staff Sgt. Evelyn Chavez/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force plans to create a new wing focused on electromagnetic spectrum warfare come springtime.While plans for the new wing ¡ª the 350th Spectrum Warfare Wing ¡ª have previously been discussed, officials Tuesday provided the most in-depth details regarding its creation, functions and timeline.The wing, which is tentatively set to activate in March 2021, will enable ¡°fielded forces to continually contest and on demand attack adversary [command, control, communication, computers and intelligence] functional structures controlling their key processes,¡± Lt. Gen. Chris Weggeman, deputy commander Air Combat Command, said during a virtual conference Nov. 17 hosted by AFCEA¡¯s Alamo chapter.¡°Their mission is to execute the U.S. version of Chinese nodal warfare,¡± the officer explained.The wing will fall under the purview of the Air Force Warfare Center ¡ª which performs operational test and evaluation, tactics development, and advanced training ¡ª instead of the new information warfare command, 16th Air Force, which has operational control of electronic warfare.The wing is a direct outgrowth of the Air Force¡¯s yearlong study on electronic warfare, called the Enterprise Capability Collaboration Team, that was briefed to service leadership in January 2019. Specifically, two items identified in the study that led to the wing¡¯s creation is that the Air Force¡¯s electromagnetic spectrum capabilities atrophied over the past decades and there will need to be greater reliance on the spectrum in the future, according to Brig. Gen. Marty Reynolds, vice commander of the Air Force Warfare Center, who spoke during the same conference.Spectrum is an enabler, he said. ¡°If we believe that and we understand how important data is ¡ª that the computing and sensing at the edge is going to be informant going forward ¡ª then we have to make sure that we protect the transport of that data and that we can aggregate the data so we can make predictions to the analysis,¡± he added.Other electromagnetic spectrum changes made within the Air Force recently include the realignment of its electromagnetic spectrum management office from Air Combat Command to the Headquarters Air Force staff under the deputy chief of staff for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and cyber effects operations, or A2/6.Know all the coolest acronymsSign up for the C4ISRNET newsletter about future battlefield technologies.Enter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeWeggeman noted that the new wing will develop, host, integrate, test and distribute electronic warfare and electromagnetic spectrum mission ¡°ware,¡± while also assist in electromagnetic battle management support and be an agile software pipeline for Air Force platforms.The wing will be a clearing house for electromagnetic spectrum professionals who focus on electronic protection (measures taken to protect friendly communications and systems) and electronic attack (jamming) linked and improved through software and cognitive abilities, Reynolds explained.He added that platforms should be able to connect and share data so a platform conducting electronic support can rapidly reprogram information and share it to an electronic attack platform.The commander of the new wing will be Col.

US Air Force chief¡¯s top modernization priorities aren¡¯t what you think they are,,"Artist rendering of a B-21 Raider concept in a hangar at Dyess, Air Force Base, Texas, one of the future bases to host the new airframe. (Courtesy of Northrop Grumman)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force is spending tens of billions of dollars every year to buy new aircraft, including F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, KC-46 tankers, the T-7A trainer jet and more. But none of those platforms makes the list of Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown¡¯s top three modernization priorities.¡°In some cases, I¡¯m not so much enamored with airplanes, although, you know, I flew airplanes,¡± Brown said during a Nov. 12 interview where Defense News asked him to list his top three weapons priorities for the Air Force.¡°It¡¯s really the capability¡± that matters, he said. ""And as we look at, you know, future conflicts, we may be fighting differently. I don¡¯t know that for a fact. But when I came in, cyber wasn¡¯t a thing. Now it is. Space was a benign environment. Now, not as much.Here¡¯s what Brown put on his list:1. Nuclear modernizationBrown pointed to the recapitalization of the Air Force¡¯s nuclear weapons and delivery systems as his No. 1 modernization priority.¡°Nuclear modernization is there at the top,¡± Brown said. ¡°That¡¯s important.¡±The Air Force plans to field new ICBMs and develop a new stealth bomber, almost concurrently, through the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent and B-21 Raider programs. During Brown¡¯s four years as chief of staff, both efforts will hit critical milestones.Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeThe B-21 program is further along, having completed a critical design review in 2018. The first B-21 bomber is currently under construction by Northrop Grumman at the company¡¯s facilities in Palmdale, California. In August, Maj. Gen. Mark Weatherington, commander of Eighth Air Force, said the aircraft would fly in 2022.The Air Force plans to buy at least 100 B-21s, though it is considering a larger program of record.Meanwhile, the Air Force awarded Northrop a $13 billion contract for the GBSD program in September. Although the legacy Minuteman III ICBMs won¡¯t begin to be retired and replaced until 2029, it will be Brown¡¯s job to ensure the program stays on track and gets the funding it needs during the pivotal early days of its engineering and manufacturing development stage.An unarmed Minuteman III ICBM launches during an operational test at on Oct. 29, 2020, at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. (U.S. Air Force)An unarmed Minuteman III ICBM launches during an operational test at on Oct. 29, 2020, at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. (U.S. Air Force)Aside from major delivery systems, the Air Force is also pursuing a dual-capable air-launched cruise missile: the Long Range Standoff Missile.The Air Force is responsible for two legs of the nuclear triad ¡ª intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear bombers ¡ª with the Navy responsible for ballistic missile submarines. With the Navy currently replacing its current Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with the Columbia class, all of the nation¡¯s major nuclear modernization bills will be coming to a head around the same time.That may create pressure on the Air Force¡¯s and the Navy¡¯s budgets in the coming years, especially as spending is projected to flatten. But the services have contended there is no time to waste when it comes to nuclear modernization ¡ª all programs must stay on schedule.2. Advanced Battle Management SystemLike his predecessor, now-retired Gen. Dave Goldfein, Brown wants the Air Force¡¯s shooters and sensors to be able to instantaneously share data with the joint force ¡ª a concept the military has termed Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control.Brown¡¯s second priority, the Advanced Battle Management System, is the Air Force¡¯s effort to field a series of technologies that will make CJADC2 a reality.¡°I look at ABMS [as critical] because that¡¯s going to help us enable our decision-making and how we contribute to Joint All-Domain Command and Control,¡± Brown said. (The ¡°C¡± in the concept¡¯s name was recently added.)However, Brown acknowledged the service has more work to do to convince lawmakers of the viability of the ABMS program. The Air Force envisions ABMS as a family of systems ¡ª think everything from cloud computing technologies, artificial intelligence algorithms and smart devices alongside traditional communications gear like radios.Instead of issuing exact requirements, the service wants to test what industry has available in a series of ¡°on ramp¡± exercises, eventually buying what works after technologies are customized to meet user needs.Jiren Parikh, Ghost Robotics CEO, briefs service members on the capabilities of the Robodogs during the Advanced Battle Management System demonstration at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., on Dec. 18, 2019.

(Tech. Sgt. Joshua J. Garcia/U.S. Air Force)Congress, however, has been skeptical. While the Air Force requested $302 million for the program in fiscal 2021, the House and Senate Appropriations committees would subtract anywhere from $50 million to almost $100 million from that sum, citing concerns about the service¡¯s acquisition strategy and lack of detailed requirements.¡°That¡¯s feedback to me, feedback to the Air Force that something is maybe being lost in the translation,¡± Brown said. ¡°We¡¯re doing this a bit different than we have done a traditional acquisition program. ... And for us, for the Hill, it is a bit different. I think it¡¯s an area that we, as an Air Force, do need to do a little bit better job of how we talk it up.¡±3. Cutting-edge acquisition methodsBrown¡¯s third modernization priority isn¡¯t a program at all: He wants to see continued advancements in new acquisition methods that allow the Air Force to more quickly buy new equipment at lower prices.Currently, ¡°by the time [new technology] gets to the hands of the war fighter, the software that¡¯s in it is a decade or two decades or 15 years old. How are we able to do things a bit faster in that regard?¡± Brown said.He pointed to advanced manufacturing processes like digital engineering, which employs detailed data and models during the design of a product, and simulates how it will be manufactured, tested, operated and sustained throughout its life cycle.Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper has heralded techniques like digital engineering for enabling the rapid development and recent first flight of a full-scale demonstrator aircraft, which was tested as part of the service¡¯s Next Generation Air Dominance program. Roper told Defense News in September that it will be up to Brown and other Air Force leaders to decide whether it¡¯s worth buying into the Digital Century Series plan for NGAD, which would involve the service more rapidly purchasing small batches of aircraft from various manufacturers.While Brown didn¡¯t comment on whether the Air Force has committed to the Digital Century Series model for purchasing future combat jets, he cited the approach as one that could potentially speed up the fielding of new technologies.¡°If we keep doing the same approach we have since I¡¯ve been in the Air Force and expect a different result, then we¡¯re not going to do very well,¡± Brown said.¡°We have to change our approach. And this drives change in our thinking, change about how we think about acquisition, it changes how we as an Air Force engage with and collaborate with [the Office of the Secretary of Defense], with [the Pentagon¡¯s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office], with the Hill, with industry. And, you know, I think we¡¯ve gotten some traction in certain areas, but it¡¯s going to require constant dialogue and collaboration and transparency.¡±",,Valerie Insinna,2020/11/17,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/11/17/the-air-force-chiefs-top-modernization-priorities-arent-what-you-think-they-are/

"Top US Air Force general wants to go faster, but the biggest changes won¡¯t happen for another year",,"Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown speaks with senior leadership and Air University faculty on Aug. 26, 2020. (Melanie Rodgers Cox/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª Shortly after U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Charles Q. Brown took command this August, he vowed to quickly adopt a radical plan to overhaul the service in preparation for a future fight against an advanced nation, like Russia or China.But the Air Force of the future won¡¯t really begin to take shape until fiscal 2023, after the service wraps up extensive force planning exercises and molds its budget to reflect its findings, Brown told Defense News in an exclusive Nov. 12 interview.In contrast to the FY21 budget, where the Air Force tried to find money to invest in technological priorities by getting rid of more than 100 aircraft across its bomber, tanker and drone fleets, the FY22 request will likely only feature some modest changes to the service¡¯s inventory.¡°We are going to retire some [aircraft in FY22], but it¡¯s not a huge amount,¡± Brown said.Part of the reason for a more conventional budget submission in FY22, Brown said, is that he simply hasn¡¯t had enough time to put his stamp on it since becoming chief of staff. The presidential election ¡ª and the uncertainty in recent months about what a Biden presidency or second Trump term could mean for defense budgets ¡ª also played a role in shaping a less radical spending request.¡°Whether it¡¯s a change of administration or not, you always go into, I think, election years with a little bit different [mindset],¡± Brown said. ¡°You probably don¡¯t make as many big, bold moves in certain areas. And so there are some things we will take a look at as we work through [FY]22. It won¡¯t be as big as some of the things we already proposed in [FY]21. And as we look at [FY]23, this is where I¡¯m really focused.¡±On Aug. 31, a couple weeks after being sworn in as the Air Force¡¯s top general, Brown released his vision for the service, ¡°Accelerate Change or Lose.¡± In it, he warns the Air Force is facing the most difficult force posture decisions in generations, and unless the service makes bold moves more quickly, it could face defeat in a future war against a nation like China or Russia.Asked whether the Air Force has moved out rapidly enough on that directive, Brown acknowledged: ¡°I always believe we could go a little bit faster.¡±Sign up for our Military Space ReportGet the latest news about space and strategic systemsSubscribeHowever, he said some internal bureaucratic changes have been encouraging, such as including the heads of Air Force major commands earlier in the force design process, and having discussions about where there is concern or dissent during meetings instead of afterward.Winter is comingAs the Air Force heads into the final stretch of FY22 budget deliberations this winter, several factors could complicate the situation.The White House¡¯s Office of Management and Budget is trying to raid the Army and Air Force budget for funds that will give the Navy a path to a 500-ship fleet, according to a Breaking Defense report published earlier this week.Moreover, while negotiations about how much the other services will have to pay to boost shipbuilding accounts are ongoing, Breaking Defense also reported that President Donald Trump is considering releasing the federal budget before the inauguration of Joe Biden as president in January ¡ª a move that could make the presidential transition and upcoming budget fight even more arduous.Asked whether the Air Force has been told to sacrifice part of its budget to pay for Navy priorities, Brown said he is aware of reports but hasn¡¯t been given direction from OMB.¡°I¡¯ve not gotten a phone call that says: ¡®For the Air Force, here¡¯s what you need to give up,¡¯ ¡± he said. ¡°My job here is to provide my best military advice on the capability the United States Air Force provides for the joint team, and that¡¯s what I intend to do. And as I do that, I¡¯m sure that the department¡¯s leadership will then determine how best to balance between the various services.¡±Another complication could be the presidential transition itself. In the wake of Biden¡¯s apparent electoral victory this past weekend, Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday, replacing him with Christopher Miller, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center.The White House has demanded the resignations of several other top Pentagon officials since then, stoking concerns from Democrats and national security experts about major defense policy pronouncements that could be coming down the pipeline.For now, the Air Force¡¯s top civilian officials ¡ª including its secretary, Barbara Barrett ¡ª remain in place.Despite the churn in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Brown said he is ¡°not particularly¡± concerned about the personnel changes at the Pentagon.¡°We [in the military] see change, you know, all the time,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s just like, for those of us in uniform, where you have a change of command. That is a change of commander, and you continue to stay focused on the mission. You continue to do your job, and that¡¯s what I intend to do. That¡¯s what I expect airmen to do.¡±",,Valerie Insinna?,2020/11/13,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/11/13/the-top-air-force-general-wants-to-go-faster-but-the-biggest-changes-wont-happen-for-another-year/

"With air bases at risk, Agile Combat Employment must mature",,"Members of the U.S. Air Force's 44th Aircraft Maintenance Unit prepare to rearm an F-15C Eagle during an Agile Combat Employment exercise Feb. 21, 2020, at Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Japan. (Senior Airman Rhett Isbell/U.S. Air Force)China and Russia can increasingly hold overseas U.S. bases at risk. To adapt, the Air Force must evolve from its dependence on well-established airfields, or risk yielding an operational edge.Beijing¡¯s asymmetric arsenal includes thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles capable of striking the first and second island chains of the Western Pacific. Moscow also boasts an immense quantity of ballistic and cruise missiles that easily range all of Europe.The Air Force is especially vulnerable to these threats because of its reliance on prepared airfields. While the service can overcome some disadvantages with long-range bombers, a war in which missiles knock out American air bases and prevent the ability to launch and recover short-range fighter jets is unlikely to end well.To meet this challenge, the Air Force has developed Agile Combat Employment, or ACE.ACE is an operational concept that leverages networks of well-established and austere air bases, multi-capable airmen, pre-positioned equipment, and airlift to rapidly deploy, disperse and maneuver combat capability throughout a theater. Paired with aircraft fueling, arming and limited maintenance activities, ACE expands the number of bases from which air forces can generate combat sorties.This severely complicates an adversary¡¯s targeting calculus, as air forces could ¡°pick up¡± ¡ª as Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., the Air Force chief of staff, puts it ¡ª and move operations at any time.The Air Force unveiled its shift to ACE in 2017. Since then, through cross-major command initiatives and coordination, ACE has evolved to produce multidisciplinary support personnel, expanded to recurrent use in exercises and served as a foundation to further interoperability.ACE has also progressed to include other airframes: Bombers were recently incorporated with the standing up of bomber task forces, or BTF. While BTFs have operated from well-established airfields with sizable logistics tails thus far, the Air Force envisions them becoming more expeditionary in the future.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeWhile efforts to date are laudable, more must be done to quickly mature the war-fighting concept, as the threats posed by China and Russia are manifest today. This sense of urgency is reinforced by Gen. Brown¡¯s call for the service to ¡°accelerate change.¡±First, access to ally and partner nation airfields must be expanded. If American air forces are constrained to U.S. main operating bases within the Indo-Pacific region and Europe, the ability to ¡°pick up¡± and move at a time, and to a place, of the combatant command¡¯s choosing is markedly diminished. In turn, capability in theater risks becoming static. Such forces are easy targets for Beijing or Moscow.Both regional commands are making strides to alleviate this concern: Agreements and infrastructure improvements in the Western Pacific and Eastern Europe serve as examples. However, considering the waves of missiles one might expect at the start of a high-end fight, pursuit of additional operating locations is warranted.US Air Force tests ¡®base in a box¡¯ in Poland    Second, the procurement of pre-positioned equipment must be accelerated. To reduce theater airlift requirements, it is imperative to pre-position equipment that airmen will need to support forward aircraft. This is particularly true in the Indo-Pacific, as it lacks the well-established multimodal networks found in Europe.Unfortunately, procurement timelines for these materials are often lengthy. For example, full fielding of U.S. Air Forces in Europe¡¯s deployable air base system kits is not expected until 2026. This will be protracted further for Pacific Air Force¡¯s regionally based cluster pre-position kits, which have yet to receive funding as part of the Air Force¡¯s latest budget request.If troops cannot posture these kits in a timely manner, America¡¯s air forces may risk moving to insufficiently outfitted locations ¡ª a result that would adversely impact ACE execution.Third, planners should assess the role and capacity of airlift. Airlift will invariably incur a heavier burden to execute ACE. Needed to carry the crews and cargo supporting fighter aircraft from one location to the next, transport assets prove integral to this concept¡¯s agility. However, given the fleet¡¯s high demand, it is prudent to evaluate whether it could sustain ACE across a contested environment. This examination should account for current and future demands to fully identify air mobility limitations. The findings would help determine the right mix of airlift and whether requirements exist for an airframe not in the inventory or more long-range bombers.Finally, the Air Force must broaden its training to create multi-capable airmen. Due to finite capacity to rapidly shift support personnel worldwide, the Air Force is training airmen to take on roles outside of their traditional jobs. This effort reduces the logistics tail required to project combat power.Thus far, multi-capable training has been developed and executed by various major commands, and ¡ª at the start of this year ¡ª the Air Force began crafting a program baseline. To build on this foundation and produce multirole airmen from the outset of their military career, incorporating the new training standard into applicable technical schools would aid in growing the requisite skills needed to compete in tomorrow¡¯s fight.Each of these components is critical to ACE¡¯s success against a peer adversary. Without timely development and implementation ¡ª in the words of Gen. Brown ¡ª ¡°we risk losing the certainty with which we have defended our national interests for decades.¡±Maj. Scott D.

"Senate appropriators add F-35s to defense budget, but there are strings attached",,"Lawmakers want more details about how the F-35 program is spending taxpayer funds (Tech. Sgt. Ryan Campbell/U.S. Air National Guard)WASHINGTON ¡ª The Senate wants to spend an additional $1.7 billion to buy 17 more F-35 fighter jets for the military in fiscal 2021.The Senate Appropriations Committee¡¯s $696 billion defense spending bill, which was released Nov. 10, would add 12 F-35As for the Air Force and five F-35Cs for the Navy and Marine Corps for a total of 96 jets in FY21. That¡¯s five more than House appropriators proposed.The release of the Senate¡¯s spending proposal paves the way for an eventual deal with the House, which passed its own appropriations bill in July. But no matter which chamber of Congress wins out, the Defense Department will fall short of the 98 F-35s it purchased in FY20, potentially signaling that even Congress has a limit on how far it will go to beef up purchases of the Lockheed Martin-made jet.In addition, lawmakers want more visibility from the Pentagon about how exactly it¡¯s spending taxpayer funds.The Pentagon requested a total of 79 F-35s in FY21:48 F-35A conventional-takeoff-and-landing jets for the Air Force.10 F-35B short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing variants for the Marine Corps.21 F-35C carrier variants split between the Navy and the Marine Corps.¡°The Committee notes that the Department of Defense continues to request fewer than 60 F-35A variants,¡± which is the Air Force¡¯s yearly procurement goal, ¡°and that the F¨C35B procurement profile was reduced to 10 aircraft in the fiscal year 2021 President¡¯s budget request, five fewer than were planned in the fiscal year 2020 President¡¯s budget for fiscal year 2021,¡± the committee stated in its explanation of why it had chosen to boost funding for the program.The funding, however, will come with some strings attached. Senate appropriators want quarterly reports on the status of Turkish suppliers in the F-35¡äs supply chain. Turkey was ejected from the F-35 program in 2019 following its acceptance of the Russian S-400 air defense system, and the Pentagon is in the process of removing Turkish companies from the aircraft¡¯s supply chain.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeHowever, the full transition from Turkish-made components will not occur until around 2023 ¡ª a timeline that has frustrated some lawmakers.The committee also directed the Pentagon¡¯s F-35 program office to provide budgetary information about how Lockheed Martin is compensating the government for spare parts that were not ready on time to be installed on the aircraft. The company in September agreed to invest about $70.6 million to fix problems that the Defense Department said had resulted in increased costs and hours lost.Despite adding funds to purchase more jets, lawmakers raised a number of concerns about a lack of transparency regarding the finer points of F-35 production, sustainment and modernization.¡°The committee continues to support follow-on modernization of the F-35¡± through the department¡¯s Continuous Capability Development and Delivery strategy, which calls for using agile software development practices to enable incremental updates to the F-35 every quarter, the committee said, though it noted ¡°some concerns over the ability to measure delivered software updates against planned capabilities, the synchronization of capability of fielded aircraft, and the ability to maintain training cycles.¡±¡°However, the committee is deeply concerned with the Department¡¯s approach to budgeting for C2D2 and the lack of detail in the budget justification materials,¡± the committee added, criticizing the program¡¯s budget documentation for not always providing easy ¡°traceability¡± among requested, allocated and spent funding.Senate appropriators also questioned the F-35 program¡¯s strategy of buying components in bulk ahead of need, a practice called ¡°economic order quantity.¡± Usually, bulk purchases of parts are done in tandem with congressionally approved multiyear contracts, but lawmakers approved EOQ procurement for the F-35 with no multiyear contract in place.The EOQ buy for F-35 lots purchased from FY18 through FY20 never resulted in the estimated $400 million in savings originally projected, the Senate committee said. And because the Pentagon had decreased the number of F-35s it planned to buy over FY21 through FY23, it is unlikely that the projected savings for that time period also would not be reached.¡°Given the lack of savings materialized and continued adjustments to F¨C35 aircraft quantities year-over-year, the committee questions whether appropriations for EOQ should continue to be provided to the F¨C35 program,¡± the committee said. ¡°However, the committee notes that changes to funding, contracting, and acquisition strategies midstream could have detrimental effects on program costs and the supplier base and therefore recommends fully funding the EOQ requested in fiscal year 2021.¡±",,Valerie Insinna ,2020/11/10,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/11/10/senate-appropriators-add-f-35s-to-defense-budget-but-there-are-strings-attached/

Data standards pose a sneaky obstacle to joint war fighting,,"Data underpins the Pentagon's CJADC2 concept, but experts say cultural barriers stand in the way of the services sharing their data. (Alejandro Pe?a/U.S. Air Force)WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force¡¯s concept Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control requires an intricate web that connects sensors and shooters, while employing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly sift through data. But to connect these platforms across domains and services, data must seamlessly flow across networks with disparate owners. And to do that, the services must agree on a level of data standards.This is a difficult task ¡ª one that several experts told C4ISRNET is made more difficult by cultural barriers.¡°If you don¡¯t have data standards, then, you know, what¡¯s the accuracy and trustworthiness of the data? The defense data decision can be life or death decisions. And in those situations, the data needs to be trusted,¡± said Kate Mercer, a vice president for Booz Allen Hamilton¡¯s defense business.Data standardization includes agreeing to common data formats and architectures to ensure disparate data sets across the services are easily accessible to sister services.¡°This requires getting over the cultural problems of sharing data and being told what to do with your data,¡± retired Rear Adm. Danelle Barrett, former deputy chief information officer of the Navy, told C4ISRNET. ¡°As long as I¡¯ve been in this business, the friction between services, even intra-service, between commands and everybody, about how to try to put standardization on data has been a losing effort in most cases, just because that is the hard part.¡±The Army and Air Force have made progress with their respective chiefs of staff, signing a two-year agreement to enable Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control starting with ¡°mutual standards for data sharing and service interfacing.¡±¡°The Army and Air Force are working together more closely on common data standards, common architectures, the use of open interfaces, common cloud tools,¡± Army Brig. Gen.

The problem, like so many IT challenges in the Department of Defense and civilian government, is cultural, not technological.¡°Leaders need to be open and transparent in their conversations,¡± said Juliana Vida, chief technical adviser of the public sector at Splunk, who also served as deputy Navy CIO. ¡°Decision-makers and leaders need to just jump in and accept and trust the processes that already exist so they can move forward and actually use the technology that is available.¡±The data pushThe DoD¡¯s data strategy, released in early October, signaled a cultural push in this direction, listing ¡°standards¡± as one of the four ¡°essential capabilities¡± to enable joint war fighting. Data standards underpin several of the stated goals within the strategy, including ensuring data is understandable, accessible and linked.The strategy stated that standards should be applied at the ¡°earliest practical point in the data lifecycle¡± and follow industry standards for open-data architectures where practical. It also noted that ¡°standards are not an end unto themselves, but rather, they provide value when enabling data and information to be readily and securely utilized and exchanged.¡±Brett Loubert, a principal in Deloitte¡¯s defense business, said open-data architectures and standards will unlock capabilities that would not be gained otherwise.¡°You¡¯re actually now sort of inviting them into this collaborative discussion and collaborative development of standards.

Gen. Clinton Hinote, who leads the Air Force¡¯s strategy office, said the services have agreed that ¡°as much as we can, we will come up with common standards¡± while allowing access to each other¡¯s data.Still, if there are areas where the services can¡¯t agree, technologies are available to ensure interoperability.¡°Even if we can¡¯t come up with common standards, we realize that translators are going to be something that will be with us for a long time, and we will build the translators necessary to make sure we can share,¡± Hinote told Defense News.However, Barrett said, adding new tools to translate data will increase latency in the process.Connecting sensors and shooters will require advanced capabilities such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Basic, agreed-upon data standards will ease data ingestion and discoverability across the services, Barrett added. But the services must also grapple with legacy platforms that have been around for years or decades.¡°You have to account for how you get those legacy data into this environment too. Now it becomes infinitely easier as you move forward setting data standards, to build those data standards into the design requirements of the systems, to make sure the data are more inoperable moving forward,¡± Barrett said.¡°But that also requires that the services agree to formats that they can live with.

"For Canada, multibillion-dollar training program is the FAcT of the matter",,"CT-155 Hawk aircraft are shown on the tarmac at 15 Wing Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The aircraft are currently used for pilot training for the Royal Canadian Air Force, but the country hopes to enter into a new contract for future pilot and aircrew training by 2023. (Royal Canadian Air Force)VICTORIA, British Columbia ¡ª The Royal Canadian Air Force plans to combine two training programs under a single, multibillion-dollar project, a move that will lead to incumbent contractors CAE and a consortium led by KF Aerospace facing off against a series of large firms.The government plans to issue a call for bids from defense companies next year for the Future Aircrew Training program, or FAcT. A draft bid package is expected to be released by the end of the year so prequalified firms can provide feedback to the Canadian Armed Forces.The contract is estimated to be worth at least CA$5 billion (U.S. $3.75 billion) and will provide training for Air Force pilots and crew for 20 years. Canada plans to award the contract in 2023.The government has already approved a list of firms that will be authorized to bid on FAcT, including Babcock Canada, Leonardo Canada, Lockheed Martin Canada and SkyAlyne Canada. SkyAlyne is a partnership between major Canadian defense firms CAE and KF Aerospace. Those two companies currently provide the two main aircrew training programs to the Air Force.Under FAcT, the number of pilots trained annually will slightly increase. The pilot production numbers for FAcT are expected to range from about 105 to a maximum of 120. In addition, air combat systems officers and airborne electronic sensor operators will also be trained under the program. Currently, that training is done in-house by the service.¡°We¡¯re very focused on getting this to contract,¡± Air Force Col. Pete Saunders, director of air simulation and training, said of FAcT. ¡°In the end, the foundation of the Air Force is our ability to generate qualified aviators. That is what FAcT is all about.¡±ConsolidationFAcT will combine two existing training programs. The first, NATO Flying Training in Canada, is provided by CAE¡¯s military aviation training division, which operates out of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. The program offers undergraduate and postgraduate pilot training in military-controlled airspace using training aircraft with advanced glass cockpits. That contact ends in 2023.Sign up for our Training & Sim ReportGet the latest news in training and simulation technologiesSubscribeThe second program is the Contracted Flying Training and Support, which is run by a KF Aerospace-led consortium. Training is conducted out of the Southport Aerospace Centre near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The program ¡°oversees the flying training and support services contract for the Primary and Basic Flying Training, Multi-Engine and Helicopter pilot training programs,¡± according to the government. That contract ends in 2027.Training for Royal Canadian Air Force pilots involves various fixed-wing aircraft ¡ª including the Grob 120A, CT-156 Harvard II, CT-155 Hawk and King Air C90 ¡ª as well as Bell 206 and 412 helicopters. Air combat systems officers and airborne electronic sensor operators are trained on CT-142 Dash-8 planes. Simulation is also extensively used in aircrew training.Saunders said the Air Force is being as flexible as possible to allow industry competitors to come up with what they believe will be the best solution for the service¡¯s training needs.¡°The way we¡¯re approaching this is that it is up to them to determine what training aids are required,¡± he explained. ¡°They will determine what is the appropriate mix of simulation and live fly. They will look at the number and type of aircraft they require in order to meet their training solution.¡±The Canadian government will issue a call for bids from defense firms next year for a multibillion-dollar contract to provide pilot and aircrew training for Royal Canadian Air Force personnel.

Saunders said he hopes to release the RFP by mid-2021.Apart from providing training and maintenance, the winning bidder must revitalize the aging training infrastructure, he added. The Air Force expects the construction of a new training center for air combat systems officers and airborne electronic sensor operators, as the current facility in Winnipeg, Manitoba, is quite old. Other new infrastructure, such as hangars, will also likely be built.Officials are requiring the winning supplier to invest in Canada equal to the value of the contract, but the government is also focused on a winning bid that emphasizes domestic firms playing a major role in training, simulation and in-service support.The government also has an ongoing competition for the acquisition of a new fighter jet to replace the Air Force¡¯s fleet of CF-18 aircraft.

(Benoit Tessier/AFP via Getty Images)STUTTGART, Germany ¨C The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election has reinvigorated conversations regarding Europe¡¯s efforts to rebuild its own defense capabilities ¨C no matter who occupies the White House.Recent commitments to invest in pan-European defense solutions are becoming more urgent, and observers are looking for proof that these proposed joint programs are truly coming to life.One effort being held up to the microscope is mainland Europe¡¯s program to field a next-generation fighter aircraft and weapon program by 2040. The Future Combat Air System, or FCAS, includes a sixth-generation fighter jet, multiple ¡°remote carrier¡± drones, a next-generation weapon system, a brand new jet engine, advanced sensors and stealth technologies, and an ¡°air combat cloud.¡± Airbus and Dassault Aviation serve as lead contractors for the program, representing Germany and France, respectively. Indra leads Spain¡¯s industry participation.FCAS is among multiple pan-European defense programs that have emerged amid four years of a U.S. presidency under Donald Trump. Since 2016, Trump has questioned the ongoing relevancy of trans-Atlantic efforts, including NATO, and called on European allies to spend more on their collective defense.As of Friday morning, votes continued to be tallied to determine the next leader of the United States. On the eve of the election, German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer warned in an op-ed published by Politico that the ¡°illusions of European strategic autonomy must come to an end.¡±While the minister emphasized that policymakers in Germany and Europe must continue to ramp up their military capabilities, she also urged the continent to acknowledge that ¡°for the foreseeable future, we will remain dependent¡± upon U.S. security cooperation. Other U.S.-European policy observers wrote on social media this week that the chaotic process of the presidential election should be a wakeup call for Europe to maintain a laser focus on its own strategic destiny.Asked whether the U.S. election may complicate Europe¡¯s motivation to build joint military capabilities, Joel Barre, director of the French procurement office Direction G¨¦n¨¦rale de l¡¯Armement (DGA) recently told reporters that the Franco-German cooperation on FCAS and other programs would remain ¡°anchored.¡±Defense aerospace primes are raking in money for classified programsDefense aerospace primes are raking in money for classified programsHere's everything aerospace industry executives told investors about the secret aviation programs they're working on.By: Valerie InsinnaSign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribeThe next five years will be crucial for the program to prove itself, analysts and nation stakeholders agreed. The partners involved are moving quickly through the effort¡¯s initial stages, said Bruno Fichefeux, FCAS leader for Airbus, in an interview.Since the program¡¯s inception in 2017, the industry team is now 19 companies wide and has invested over 200 million euros into the ongoing Joint Concept Study phase, along with signed technology demonstrator contracts, he noted.¡°It¡¯s a sign of a strong motivation by all partners to make it happen,¡± he said.The results of the Joint Concept Study, launched in 2019, are expected to be revealed in summer 2021, the French defense ministry told Defense News. Meanwhile, the teams are working in parallel on Phase 1A of the demonstrator portion, launched this past February and scheduled to run for 18 months.The initial demonstrators for the next-generation fighter and remote carrier drones are expected by 2026, while the advanced combat cloud may be introduced a year earlier, a source close to the program told Defense News. The full development program is currently slated to begin around 2027.While all of the FCAS components should enter service in 2040 ¨C to replace the partner nations' fleets of Dassault Rafale and Eurofighter Typhoon fighters ¨C certain capabilities may come online sooner. For example, some first-generation remote carrier drones may be available in the early 2030s to upgrade existing Eurofighter jets, the source said.Several key decisions remain to be made. The stakeholders have not yet established a date when they will solidify the fighter jet and remote carrier designs, according to Fichefeux.The question of workshare division also remains in flux. ¡°You have to base the workshare on the typical criteria ¨C who has the skills, who has the knowledge, who has the technology, who is the best player to ensure that we can move forward on this technology without duplicating it ¨C while ensuring a level of cooperation. And this is what the nations are expecting of us,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s not a competition program. It¡¯s a cooperation program.¡±Programs like FCAS will position Europe¡¯s defense companies to remain competitive in the global market, analysts said. The complex effort to build a ¡°system of systems¡± involving multiple components and cutting-edge technical fields, has no equivalent in the history of arms cooperation programs in Europe, said H¨¦l¨¨ne Masson, a senior research fellow at the Fondation pour la Recherche Strat¨¦gique, a French independent think tank.There is pressure to ensure that European industrial players maintain and enhance their technological prowess, and to compete against their American, Asian and Russian counterparts, she told Defense News.The success of FCAS will depend on the quality of the Joint Concept Study and demonstrator phases, with the goal of reducing technological risks ¡°and therefore limit delays and possible additional costs,¡± Masson said.The program needs to start showing that it has a ¡°degree of momentum,¡± said Sash Tusa, an aerospace and defense partner at Agency Partners, a London-based independent research firm.¡°It¡¯s important to focus on three key data points: one, when is the demonstrator going to fly; two, when is the prototype going to be flying; three, when is the in-service date,¡± he told Defense News. ¡°Those are the three absolutely cast-in-stone dates, and as soon as they start moving, that tells you something about the program.¡±FCAS could still suffer from its ¡°deeply political nature,¡± Tusa noted. Previous efforts to build a Franco-German fighter jet have devolved into separate programs amid disputes over workshare.The program could be a ¡°litmus test¡± for France to prove that it is committed to a joint European weapons program this time around, said Dan Darling, a senior analyst for Forecast International, a U.S. market intelligence firm.With Spain joining FCAS nearly three years into the program, questions still remain regarding workshare among the partner nations. Indra, Madrid¡¯s industry lead, did not respond to requests for comment by this article¡¯s publication.But even if its workshare portion is smaller than that of Paris and Berlin, the research and development efforts that Spain will be privy to as part of FCAS serve as an opportunity that the nation ¡°didn¡¯t want to pass up,¡± Darling said.Some watchers remain skeptical that this joint fighter jet effort will succeed where previous endeavors have failed. ¡°It¡¯s important to remember that it would take a serious breakthrough in Franco-German defense politics to change the status quo,¡± said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group, a U.S.-based market analysis firm.But the current geopolitical pressures on Europe serve as powerful incentives for the program to succeed, Fichefeux noted.¡°The complexity of [FCAS] requires nations to put their strengths together, not only in terms of funding, but also in terms of industrial capacity and technologies,¡± he said. ¡°This trend towards sovereignty ... really favors such a program as FCAS.¡±¡°The geopolitical situation that we are facing reminds us every day that we need to have our own capabilities, and need to be able to operate in the future theaters within a sovereign manner,¡± he continued.Vivienne Machi is a reporter based in Stuttgart, Germany.

US Air Force awards ABMS contracts to another 24 vendors,,"A U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer from Ellsworth Air Force Base, S.D., and F-16 Fighting Falcons from Misawa Air Base, Japan, conducted bilateral joint training with Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) F-2s off the coast of northern Japan, April 22, 2020. (Tech. Sgt. Timothy Moore/Air Force)Correction: The Air Force has awarded ABMS contracts to 93 companies across five contract announcements.WASHINGTON ¡ª The U.S. Air Force has awarded 24 companies new contracts for its Advanced Battle Management System, according to a Nov. 4 contract announcement from the Pentagon.The contracts, which have a ceiling of $950 million each, will help the Air Force build out ABMS, its platform behind the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept, which seeks to connect sensors to shooters across domains. The contracts have a performance period of five years with a $1,000 minimum.Under the contracts, the companies will ¡°compete for future efforts associated with the maturation, demonstration and proliferation of capability across platforms and domains, leveraging open systems design, modern software and algorithm development in order to enable Joint All Domain Command and Control,¡± the contract announcement reads.The 24 companies are Altamira Technologies Corp., Amergint Technologies Inc., Carahsoft Technology Corp., Geosite Inc., Lyteworx Automation Systems LLC, MarkLogic Corp., Rebellion Defense Inc., Rhombus Power Inc., Soar Technology Inc., Vidrovr Inc, Advanced Simulation Research Inc., Borsight Inc., Datanchor Inc., Digital Mobilizations Inc., EFW Inc., F9 Teams Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Infinity Labs LLC, Radiant Mission Solutions Inc. Microsoft Corp., Ortman Consulting LLC, Peraton Inc., R2 Space Inc. and Sierra Nevada Corp.¡°This creative contract strategy is needed to support the agile and fast-paced nature of this program. These Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts provide each vendor the opportunity to receive anywhere from $1,000 to $950 million total over the next five years for work in up to seven different ABMS product categories,¡± Air Force spokesperson Capt. Clay Lancaster said in a statement.93 companies have now received ABMS contracts. The Air Force awarded four other rounds of awards in the last few months. The awards steam from a Broad Agency Announcement the service released in February.¡°This ID/IQ is part of a multi-prong innovative ABMS ¡®contract lattice¡¯ strategy to enable an agile DevOps approach to software and hardware development ¡ª to include four month onramps with Combatant Commanders ¡ª that is necessary to deliver needed capabilities to the warfighter faster and more effectively in support of the National Defense Strategy,¡± Lancaster said.Know all the coolest acronymsSign up for the C4ISRNET newsletter about future battlefield technologies.Enter your email address(please select a country)SubscribeAfter the last round of awards, Lancaster told C4ISRNET that the awards were meant to establish a line of companies that can respond to future ABMS solicitations. He added that after awards are made to vendors, the service will have more technical discussions with the vendors before releasing more ¡°focused¡± solicitations that will be open to vendors who received IDIQ contracts. Vendors will then respond to the solicitations with their proposals and task orders will be awarded.¡°These contracts provide for the development and operation of systems as a unified force across all domains (air, land, sea, space, cyber and electromagnetic spectrum) in an open architecture family of systems that enables capabilities via multiple integrated platforms,¡± the contract announcement reads.The Air Force has requested $3.3 billion in funding for ABMS, so it¡¯s unlikely the $950 million ceilings on the contracts would be reached. The announcement doesn¡¯t list specifically what capabilities each company will provide.Initial deliver orders will be funded with fiscal 2020 research, development, test and evaluation funds. Work is expected to be completed in May 2025.The third round of contract announcements are another step forward on the services' march toward joint warfighting. The Army and Air Force recently agreed to collaborate over the next two years to develop what they are calling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control.

Defense aerospace primes are raking in money for classified programs,,"This rendering of a Next Generation Air Dominance aircraft, by Lockheed Martin, shows a tailless stealthy future fighter. (Lockheed Martin)WASHINGTON ¡ª Two months after disclosing the existence of a next-generation fighter jet demonstrator, the U.S. Air Force is staying mum on which company may have built it. But one thing is for sure: Classified aviation programs are on the rise, and opportunities abound for the three major American defense aerospace primes ¡ª Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing.During an Oct. 20 earnings call with investors, Lockheed Martin Chief Financial Officer Ken Possenriede revealed the company¡¯s Aeronautics division recently won a classified contract that would necessitate the construction of a new building in Palmdale, California, where the company¡¯s Skunk Works development arm tests and creates prototypes of secret aircraft.Sales for the division were up 8 percent in this year¡¯s third quarter compared to the same period in 2019, with about $130 million of the $502 million boost attributed to classified work. But Possenriede alluded to even more growth on the horizon.¡°For Aeronautics, we do anticipate seeing strong, double-digit growth at our Skunk Works, our classified advanced development programs. We continue to execute on those recent awards,¡± he said, adding that there were a ¡°multitude of opportunities¡± still out there.Classified work also increased at Northrop Grumman¡¯s Aeronautics Systems unit, with ¡°restricted activities¡± in the autonomous systems and manned aircraft portfolios helping bolster sales by 5 percent for the quarter and 4 percent year-to-date when compared to 2019, Chief Financial Officer Dave Keffer told investors Oct. 22.It¡¯s tempting to draw a line from these contract awards to the recent flight of a demonstrator for the Next Generation Air Dominance program ¡ª the Air Force¡¯s effort to field a suite of air superiority technologies that could include drones, high-tech weapons and what some have termed as a sixth-gen fighter, although service officials have said any warplane in the mix might not resemble a traditional fighter.Even though the Air Force announced in September that at least one NGAD demonstrator exists, it¡¯s unclear which companies are involved.Still, there are plenty of other longstanding and emerging Air Force requirements that could be the source of this classified work, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst for the Teal Group.Sign up for our Early Bird BriefGet the defense industry's most comprehensive news and information straight to your inboxSubscribe¡°It¡¯s pretty clear that there¡¯s more prototyping activity going on out there than was generally known. I had assumed that most of the work related to NGAD was happening at the systems level. It¡¯s clearly happening at the airframe level too,"" he said. ""And then of course there are a lot of potential drone developments that are certainly worth watching,¡± from the MQ-9 Reaper replacement to strategic reconnaissance requirements, ¡°which is fundamentally a very expensive activity.¡±The wild card in this situation is Boeing. Because of investors' focus on the commercial side of the business ¡ª including plans for the return of the Boeing 737 Max to flight, as well as the continued downward spiral of sales caused by the global pandemic and its chilling effect on air travel ¡ª executives did not speak about Boeing Defense, Space and Security¡¯s classified activities during the company¡¯s Oct. 28 earnings call.¡°Overall, the defense and space market remains significant and relatively stable, and we continue to see solid global demand for our key programs,¡± a Boeing spokesman said in response to questions about the company¡¯s classified business. ¡°We project a $2.6 trillion market opportunity for defense and space during the next decade, which includes important classified work.¡±After years of lost competitions, there are signs that the company¡¯s combat aircraft production facilities in St. Louis, Missouri, as well as its advanced projects division, Phantom Works, are returning to health.Over the past two years, the company has banked major awards, including the Navy¡¯s MQ-25 tanker drone and the T-7A trainer jet, both of which were developed by Phantom Works. Boeing¡¯s work on the T-7 received praise from Air Force acquisition executive Will Roper for its use of digital engineering, which involves simulating the design, production and life cycle of a product in order to drive down costs. The company has also started selling the advanced F-15EX fighter jet to the Air Force, breathing a second life into that aircraft with this latest variant.But Aboulafia worried that pressure on Boeing¡¯s commercial business ¡ª combined with its strategy of leveraging the work of other aircraft makers on projects like the T-7, where Swedish manufacturer Saab had a heavy influence in shaping the design ¡ª may have led to a loss of resources and engineering talent at Phantom Works.¡°Either they¡¯re sitting it out now because their focus is elsewhere, or they don¡¯t have the capabilities and the commitment that the others do, or we¡¯re just not hearing about it now,¡± he said.Boeing is not the only company investing in digital engineering and advanced manufacturing processes. Northrop CEO Kathy Warden pointed to her company¡¯s use of digital engineering in the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, which the company won in September to build the Air Force¡¯s next-generation intercontinental ballistic missiles.¡°The work that we have done with the customer already, even under the tech maturation and risk reduction phase of the program, was done in a digital environment,¡± she said. ¡°We delivered artifacts for review in a fully digital environment where they were actually looking at things in a model, not documents produced. This is the first time on a program of this size where that¡¯s been the case.¡±¡°Those investments that we¡¯re making for GBSD are being utilized across our entire portfolio,¡± she added. ¡°So as we think about Next Generation Air Dominance and the programs that are part of that overall campaign ¡­ they too will benefit from a full digital engineering thread as being required by our customers.¡±",, Valerie Insinna,2020/11/3,https://www.defensenews.com/industry/2020/11/03/defense-aerospace-primes-are-raking-in-money-for-classified-programs/
