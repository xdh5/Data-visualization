    Substance: Invention Relates To Aircraft Control Systems And Can Be Used In A Complex Of Functional Programs For Control And Guidance Of Aircraft Systems For Assigning Targets To Interceptors When Aircraft Groups Are Confronted. Disclosed Method Enables To Determine Purpose Of Targets For Interceptors In A Group Confrontation. Method Is Based On Using An Interception Efficiency Functional. Functional Is Determined For Each Pair Of ""Interceptor-Target"" And Takes Into Account Both Time And Energy Costs For Interception. Then Among A Certain Class Of Trajectories One Is Selected, Which Ensures Minimum Of Specified Functional At Fulfillment Of Restrictions On Maximum Speed And Acceleration Of Interceptor. Intercept Matrix Is Composed Of Obtained Minimum Values Of Functionals. For Important Purposes, Probability Of Interception Of A Target By One Interceptor Is Determined And Required Probability Of Their Interception Is Set. Required Number Of Interceptors For Each Of The Important Targets Is Determined Based On The Required Probability Of Their Destruction. Then, Such Distribution Of Targets By Interceptors Is Sought, Which Minimizes Total Quality Functional And Which Provides Required Probability Of Interception Of Important Targets. Depending On The Number Of Interceptors, The Minimization Problem Is Formulated Either As An Assignment Problem With An Interception Matrix Or With Some Other Matrix Obtained From An Interception Matrix, Or In The Form Of A Problem Of Searching For A Minimum Value Flow In A Graph. Solving This Task Determines Assignment Of Targets To Interceptors Together With Corresponding Trajectories Of Interception.
    Effect: Technical Result Is Providing Automatic Optimum Assignment Of Targets To Interceptors Based On Priority Of Targets.
